# About this Project
In this project, I built a coffee chatbot by using clustering and then the classification method. In the clustering method, I used k-mean to identify the labels for the dataset. For classification, I implemented Naive Bayes, DNN, and Decision Tree to analyze the performance in classifying labels. Finally, I implemented the chatbot system to test the result.
