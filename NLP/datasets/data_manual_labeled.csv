80876,why should i care   why should i care if someone is happy in life   be at genuinely happy or just faking it   why should it matter to me   i should just be saying in my head   hey he s living his best life out there  good for him .    amp  x200b   now i m not a violent person by any means  i will never just randomly hit someone  but i am just angry  not at this random happy person  but at myself  for lacking the means to be like this random happy person  i am angry at myself  at my incompetency.   amp  x200b   another reason why i want to beat the shit out of this random happy person  is because in my head  i don t buy this happiness act  how can someone be happy in our society   with how things are   i feel like you have to have your head buried in the fucking sand to be happy with how things are  which i guess is contradictory to what i just said above  about me being angry at myself for not being happy  because if being happy means you have to be ignorant of things around you  why would i ever want to be happy   but hey i never said my emotions made any goddamm sense  if they did make sense  i would probably not be here  writing this shit of a post.   amp  x200b   maybe no one is truly happy in life   maybe those people that i identify as being happy are struggling just as much as i do  because other people expect them to be happy  because that is the norm  and if you don t appear to be happy or content with your life then something must be fucking wrong with you or something.    amp  x200b   i wouldn t say i m depressed  as in diagnostically depressed  from my understanding of depression  being depressed is not feeling   anything    being void of emotions  but i definitely feel something  i feel frustration  anger  and sadness. maybe i am depressed   i don t know really  and at this point  i don t think labels mean very much  all i know is  i m not content with my life  how it ended up  and where it is currently going  i m 23 without much going on right now  no drive nor ambition in me. i am extremely pessimistic  i only see the bad in things  and in people. i want to change  to see things differently  but it seems impossible.   amp  x200b   and if you re that happy random person walking down the street  although why the fuck would you be here if you were  then don t worry about me pummeling you  it s just a way to express my feelings  and please give me a manual to life or something  a  life for dummies  book or something  because i clearly suck at this thing.  thanks for reading through this whoever you are  i know i rambled all over  and didn t make sense  i guess it was just a rant that i needed to put out.,11/16/20 18:19,yes
179957,i m tired of being alone  no one cares.  and it makes me think  if i end my life rn.. i m pretty sure no one would know about it unless few weeks pass by and i dont pay my bills or something,11/3/21 6:46,yes
51160,i really feel like either my depression is coming back or i m about to have a breakdown or something. i ve been in bed all week  usually only getting up in the evenings to then go downstairs and watch tv. i can t muster up the energy to do anything else.  i ve dealt with depression before and i really thought i had overcome it  i used to self harm but i m way past that now  it definitely has something to do with the fact everyone in my life is moving on and i m stuck in a rut that i can t seem to get out of. a year ago i lost my job  my long term boyfriend  pretty much my sanity too and i had to leave the little flat i lived in due to me becoming so depressed. everything i had worked for i lost. since moving house last year i ve been a lot better  made progress in little things  got a dog so i know i have some responsibility now which makes me not go into a complete meltdown. but i m still jobless  i rarely see my friends  they ve all got children and or partners  i live alone so it gets quite lonely. lately i ve just been coping by drinking but i noticed that it was getting a little bit out of hand so i have stopped. but when i drink  i usually feel really good  and productive and want to do all of these different things and i wish i was like this sober. but drinking isn t the way.   yesterday i tried telling 2 friends how i felt as i don t feel ashamed to speak up about mental illness  but they didn t really respond how i thought they would  i just kinda felt fobbed off so i just said that it didn t matter. ive also noticed recently a few people that i talk to on the reg have stopped talking to me as much so now i m over thinking wondering if i m just an awful person to be around. i really do try to positive and people keep telling me that things will get better but it it doesn t feel like anything is improving  mood wise. i know we all have problems in our lives  but it just sucks that even though i m going through all of this  i m still there for people despite barely seeing them or barely talking to them  i m not the kind of person who over thinks if a friend hasn t spoken to me in a few days or anything so that isn t an issue  i quite like my own space. but i ve been there for them so many times  i don t give to receive but in this instance  i feel lost and i don t know where else to go.   my last single friend recently got back with her ex  i turn 25 in november and i m just honestly freaking out about not having really anything in my life to be proud of. i ve been looking for work but it s still so difficult with covid 19  and i can feel myself slipping deeper into this horrible hole i feel stuck in. i never used to be like this  i loved living alone and being single and being able to be myself and not having to change for anyone etc. but now i find myself crying most nights  i can t sleep  the only sleep i get is a few hour naps here and there and i ve had this headache for like 3 days. i m so sick and tired of feeling like this and i always say to myself that i m gonna get up early and maybe go for a walk and do some exercise but i never do  i ve become so anxious to even walk out my front door  the only time i do is when i walk my dog and even then i still feel anxious and i don t know why.   i know my mum would support me and try to help but she got so worried last time as i ended up in hospital  i don t want her to worry again because it s not like that this time  it s literally just me feeling all of these sucky things   i think social media has a lot to do with it also  i get so jealous of everyone who can now go and see their big group of friends and they post everything and i just wish i had their lives. i have about 4 friends individually  we re not a group. everyone s getting married or pregnant and i clearly can t even hold down a relationship. me and my ex separated in may last year and while i was bad for a while  i got over it but recently he s been in my dreams and i m not sure why  sure there ll always be something there for him but i m not in love with him anymore.   often when i watch movies i just picture myself as them to just try and sort of escape my real life  it used to help but it s not really a permanent solution. i know this is long just reading this makes me think i m just so messed up  i think talking to a counsellor would benefit me but i don t have the money and it s a really long waiting list on the nhs. i just feel so lost and i can t seem to get out of this rut. has anyone else got any similar things they ve went through and how have you dealt with it ,7/26/20 0:37,yes
65212,i m just really not good for talking about it... i ve just always kept everything to myself and now i just can t. i ve lost the girl i love just cause i wasn t able to talk to her and now i ve hit rock bottom. i don t have a job and don t even have the energy to look for one  i stopped college. i don t know what to do anymore but i don t have the guts to get help... should i talk about it to the people around me or just go get professional  help  and how am even supposed to get help i m broke as shit... i really don t know what to do i just feel lost like it ll just keep on getting worse and i just wanna feel better,9/17/20 8:07,yes
160041,today is a shit day for depression. usually i am able to isolate my brain fucking with me and the truth. but  here i am in chronic pain of a gout attack able to barely crawl to the bathroom if needed. we have two dogs who i love very much but was not able to take care of properly. i asked my wife for help.   she eventually did it. my daughter just started college this weekend. and i came home to take care of the pets and my symptoms flared up. but i let her stay on the other side of the state to get more time with our kids.  they both go to the same school.    my pain got worse after she got home to the point that i was crying on the floor last night just trying to find some relief. and all she could do is tell me i was keeping her awake for her job the next day.   symptoms were worse by morning. can t get medical help because we can t afford it. and she just left me the dogs to take care of.   i did my best. she had to let our special needs pup in and feed them both. then she laid down for a nap. i tried to join her and she left the room. basically i disgust and repulse my partner. my adhd and depression has wreaked havoc on my employment.   and my health just keeps going down the shitter.   why should i live. just to wake up and be loathed every day.,8/23/21 18:40,yes
7346,this is my first post here. but i literally cant shake this stupid ass depression amd its all just being single. i know that it sounds stupid but  me thinking about how im single makes me go down a rabbit hole of  what ifs  and  this is why . i have a bone disease that makes my legs have a curvature in the ankles and knees so im short and have a weird structure sooo obviously this isnt helping my situatuon i never know how to think to get over it. i always say  your better off being alone  and  your gonna find someone in time  but then i look at myself and see how weird i look and how no one will ever love me for who i am. it keeps me up at night some nights and the only comfort i get is when i visualise myself at the top of a bridge and picture someone actually trying to save me and me just jumping so they can live with the idea of me killing myself and them never being able to see me agian so they know my life truly sucks,2/23/20 14:53,yes
158410,my therapist isn t working out for me. my old therapist  she quit on me and i moved to a different clinic  believed i had cptsd and reluctantly diagnosed me  she hated diagnosing. she thought it never helped the patient . i was also diagnosed me with major depressive disorder  panic disorder  anxiety disorder  social anxiety  and generalized anxiety by the psychologist at that clinic. my new therapist who will call x has said   i don t think you have all of these anxiety disorders. i don t see you having anxiety.  keep in mind that i barely see this guy once every 2 4 weeks and i ve been with him for 5 months maybe 6. so  he invalidates my fucking experiences with anxiety.  there is a reason i have all of these anxiety diagnoses  i could barely leave my home without having a meltdown 2 years ago. furthermore  he has retracted my cptsd diagnosis. he says it isn t in the dsm 5 which it isn t so he tells me that i display an overwhelming symptoms of ptsd instead. he tells me every session that he will reassess me for it the next session  he never does. i try bringing it up  he tells me   next session.  he wonders why i don t trust him. he hasn t given me a single reason to trust him. he refuses to reassess me.  my old therapist believed i displayed bpd symptoms. i have a huge list of trauma that coincides with bpd  such as abandonment throughout my entire life  unstable relationships  various forms of abuse i was forced to endure. my old therapist never diagnosed me with bpd. she hated diagnosing  thought i was too young to diagnose  and she left. i have brought up this to x  new therapist  numerous times and he tells me each time   do you even know what bpd is  have you done research on it  tell me then.  yes.. i have done intensive research on bpd. for months. just assess me  it isn t that hard. i either have it or not.  i opened up to him about a horrific traumatic sa that happened to me for a period of a year when i was a child and x told me   well...that s bad. but i can t report it and neither can you to the police. it s just not illegal anymore.   i opened up to him about my severely abusive father figure that was prominent in my childhood and he said   can you really blame him after what he went through    i am fucking sick of the mental health profession and at its professionals. i do not trust a single mental health advocate  therapist  psychologist  psychiatrist or anything in its realm. they have done nothing but invalidate me  made me cry  and made me rethink if what happened to me actually happened to me.  i have no clue where to go from here.,8/18/21 0:34,yes
85469,i don t know what it feels like to be normal. i lost whatever definition of normalcy is  months ago. i haven t felt like myself in so long and it s fucking scary. i have no motivation to do anyway except drown in my thoughts and occasionally watch tv. when i m around people  you d never be able to tell because i don t want people judging. every now and then i ll be zoned out at work and someone asks if i m okay and i ll lie. i m not fucking okay. i want my life back. i want me back.,11/30/20 10:29,yes
40567,my friend  m  we used to date  is isolating himself and doesn t feel anything anymore. he doesn t use social media anymore and blocked almost everyone. he doesn t enjoy anything and hates his life. while he used to be the sweetest guy i know. it has been like this for the last couple of months... he is on meds since january and is seeing a therapist every week.  would it help if i dragged him out for a walk  even if he doesn t want to   thanks,6/18/20 11:37,yes
75099,i been depressed for years and i always think about how a few months ago i was depressed  but i wish i could go back bcuz i wasn t as depressed as i am now.. i m not even searching for happiness at this point i just don t wanna feel this way..  its like my brain challenges itself to how much pain i can take  always reaching for the lowest point.. always reminding me of the good times and how happy i was a kid and my father was alive.. and reality hits me hard because those days will never come back.. my life is constantly going downhill and i m tired of it..,10/26/20 19:24,yes
32094,i purposefully stopped taking my medications because it was getting harder to be optimistic and high functioning when everyone in my dorm ignores every attempt i try to make to make this quarantine more homey and less like being trapped. i gave up on the night that i had planned a game night and not a single person of the 25 living in my dorm showed up. i was sitting in my room all dressed up  wearing mascara and my hair done staring at my door for 2 hours which constantly trying to convince myself that they ll show up  they re just running late. no one came and no one even apologised to me about it later  it was like i wasn t even a person worth it. and today i was staring at my phone for 4 hours waiting for this girl to text me back about when i could buy a cat off her. with each second i got more depressed and angry and pathetic and had to hold back from saying things i would regret. on tpp of that im experiencing really bad withdrawal symptoms and wont even bother trying to taking my meds because id rather suffer through it than think about all the girls that ive respected only for them to treat me less. what is it about me that people find so easy to just walk all over me and ignore me ,5/19/20 17:14,yes
55566,i don t really have people to share this with  properly  tbh i don t know how to share it with them because it ll make them sad or mad or whatever so hello void  it me again  i have come to whine again hello  how are you   it s super warm here now which is honestly so shitty. i just took a cold shower and it made the veins in my hands super visible and it freaked me the fuck out. idk how veiny people handle existing  my head just filled with the need to rip them out. i stare at my hands when i feel my head drift out of my body  when it s not  me   but i feel that s getting worse and i just phase out of myself  i don t think i exist and i m not anywhere near what i see in the mirror. i really can t be. i just don t feel like her  you know  i mean i know it s bullshit and i m just telling myself lies or whatever but i just can t shake the thoughts and things  going well  doesn t help anything    i thought this would change everything and i don t know if it would be like this if i was still on the same road i was on then but wtf    why do i still feel this way then  i worked so hard lately but all it gets me is fucking crying about seeing my veins lol     okay anyway thanks internet void i hope you re having a bearable day    ,8/11/20 13:24,yes
130959,no matter what  when i start to feel even the tiniest bit content  something bad has to happen to shit all over it. it s like i m on a rollercoaster going up  when all of a sudden it starts pushing me back down.,5/13/21 1:23,yes
128611,too be honest i have a hard time caring about what people got going on. i don t know if it s cause of i ve isolated myself for so long. and having bad anxiety  my mdd or what. but it kinda concerns me.,5/5/21 13:08,yes
96174,i was talking to all my buddies and they all disappeared either without explanation or fake excuses and i seen on snap maps they were all together without me 2 hours before the countdown. as you can imagine i m questioning what i done wrong i genuinely thought i was on great terms with them all.   at this time of year it s that little bit more emotionally crushing aswell. no matter what i do this kind of stuff always happens...,12/31/20 18:34,yes
116607,everytime i see someone cute.. it always trigger me. im ugly and ill never have a single drop of those happiness. i hate myself for being ugly. no matter what i do ill never have any of those so called love,3/13/21 15:14,yes
152778,i have felt this way for so long i have always assumed it was normal  not so much that i was necessarily sad  but more often just numb  like i never really feel joy or excitement  although occasionally  i distinctly remember the occasions  i have noticeable sense of peace that cuts through my general sense of heaviness. i m not sure if this depression  and i haven t wanted to face it or label myself as such and be forced to deal with the reality of it if it is. i think i m having a hard time differentiating being depressed due to an internal chemical imbalance that needs to be reconciled  or just having a natural reaction to the state of the world or events  previous abuse  climate change  corruption  realizing you likely won t grow up to be what you thought you would be  the passage of time and loss of loved ones etc   or if that is a distinction that even matters ,7/29/21 11:13,yes
117187,i ve found myself in quite a dark place lately.  pandemic woes  isolation  recovering from spine surgery  losing mother to dementia...   i can usually dig myself out of a depressive episode with some go to activities like walking my dogs or exercising.  those aren t options currently since i have physical restrictions while i recover from surgery  happened about a month ago .  i m bored with tv.  i miss my friends  social distancing is torture for me . can t travel. can t vent to my parents since they ve got too much of their own worries.   does anyone have any suggestions for things that will make me happy  i m honestly really drawing a blank. i just want to sleep the days away but i know that s not healthy. the world is a dismal place and i m struggling to make sense of it all. no wrong answers  willing to try anything.,3/15/21 12:28,yes
96774,still trying to recover from the biggest financial mistake i had in my entire life. i m probably never going to forgive myself.  everything feels so empty... working everyday for a tiny small percentage of what i had just month ago... everything feels really pointless...  i m still in  i ll never get out of my bed  stage but eventually i ll probably try to do something... and i might try to get the money back  which is probably going to lead bigger loses...  dam i m so stupid.,1/2/21 12:08,yes
187346,i have had severe depression and mild severe anxiety since i was about 16. was falsely accused of rape and my life has just spiralled ever since.   i m 24 now and the only relief i ve had in that time is the odd day here and there where i can keep my head above the water for more than what feels like half a second.   i ve been on multiple anti depressants  i ve been off anti depressants  i ve kept a good sleep schedule  i ve been to therapy for multiple stints  i ve exercised  i m in my last year at uni and just got some good grades back  i have no trouble with and am generally good at public speaking  i have a lot of friends  i have a great best friend of 20 years  i have some good people in my family  dad used to beat me when i was younger but we re mostly good now   i ve tried meditation  i ve tried ignoring it  i ve tried facing it  i ve tried all sorts of techniques recommended through cbt sessions  i ve tried illegal drugs that supposedly help  i ve removed caffeine from my diet  i ve moved to a new town  i ve moved back home  i ve had multiple girlfriends and have never had trouble with women  i ve talked about it with friends and family. i try my best to live every day to be a good person and genuinely do think i m a good person.   despite all of this  nothing offers any release.  last year i came close to suicide but i ve managed to stave off doing that since.  before things take a final turn  is there anything else anyone can recommend i try  i want to get better  i m dying to get better  i ll try anything  it s just that nothing works.,11/29/21 0:50,yes
100876,my dad died 1 month ago  and i miss him everyday and i dont think i can continue life without him  its so much harder because ive known my dad all my life and hes gone and i wont ever see him ever again until the day i die which would probably not happen anytime soon  and now my mum has cancer and this is just so hard  i dont want to lose both my parents now.   ,1/14/21 0:08,yes
139272,i feel like i failed everyone that ever believed in me. my parents had such high hopes for me and my future but right now i am unemployed  i quit work because i had a total breakdown and nearly killed myself multiple times  had an alcohol addiction  went through rehab  sitting at home  searching for a job. recently i have seen so many videos on the internet of parents or grandparents being proud of their kids and every time i just think about how i failed everyone. i just have to get this off my chest because right now i feel like ending it all.,6/10/21 18:43,yes
69655,a piece of me died today.  i will type this here since i couldn t tell you.  i had thoughts of killing myself again on my birthday. i sat in my pitch dark room  having flashbacks to all those good memories we made together. i cried thinking about the cake i received for my birthday  wondering why i couldn t cut you a slice to enjoy it with me. i ve been having dreams with you in it the past few nights. i ve been having broken sleep cycles this past week  and i sometimes wake up gasping for you. you have changed my life in so many different directions  but in good ways. if i could go back in time  i would re experience that first night that i met you over and over and over. you are good for me  and i know deep down that i can be good for you too. i wish you would put a little more faith into me  and that you could believe that i ve been changing and working on myself to be a better version of me. i know you would try to stop your smile towards me if you randomly got to see me again in person. i know that when we re both hanging out  we both feel good. we get lost into each other in those moments and that is what life is about. those are the memories that we are supposed to remember for the rest of our lives.  i still love you. i still want you. i still miss you.  take your time. get your space.  i ll still love you. i don t think i will pursue another girl in my life again.  my heart will stay open for you. i ve made up my mind. so if you come back  then come back.  i ll be here. i ll try to keep living.  i hope you come around to being loved by me.  i hope time shows you it s possible.,10/5/20 9:06,yes
49486,i mean  i feel really tired  depressed and i m full of negative thoughts  so why do i say things like  everything will get better  and all that stuff to others when i don t really think like that  it s a bit weird but i m sure someone will understand.,7/19/20 12:25,yes
101340,personality   none  smarts   none   discipline  none   hobbies   none.   passions   nothing  focus levels  0.  will to live   none   happiness   none  energy levels   none  motivation levels   none   stress levels   high   urge to die   extremely high   guess i should just  try new things  why am i expected to live what the fuck   while having ocd and being ugly as hell. this life is hell without a doubt,1/15/21 14:08,yes
73461,whenever this subreddit pops up i wonder why i m still following it but than i type in  depression into twitter and i feel worse for hating all that positivity.  it feels empty and cheap. not only that i feel bad for those kind words not helping me and making me feel more alone.  i guess misery likes company because at least it beats alienation,10/20/20 11:41,yes
146826,i am a 35 year old brazilian teacher  and i can t remember the last time i felt meaningful joy. i feel guilty by saying that because i have a nice family and a wonderful girlfriend and they love me and respect me so much  but i feel like crap. i did therapy on and off for around 10 years  i took medicine  i tried meditation... i have dreams that remain that  dreams. one of them is to write. i don t fantasize in becoming famous or anything  but whenever i sit down to write   after i read my production  it just sucks so much. it s anguishing to attempt something and realize that you re not good enough for that. i know that somethings require practice  but i don t feel that all the effort is worth it because in the end i always come to the same conclusion  i don t like life  i think i never did. i think i ve always looked for peace and happiness but i can t find it anywhere  not even inside of me. i just don t know what to decide  end everything or accept that i ll be forever unhappy until my natural non suicidal death. i think i just need someone neutral to talk  because i can t say these things to my family. brazilians are too emotional  sensitive and almost zero rational  so it s be inevitable to hurt someone if i shared what i actually think. i simply can t stand this place anymore.,7/8/21 0:49,yes
145273,i m 17m  and always so fucking miserable  5 6 7 days a week i m just in pure misery for months on end and i can t deal with it anymore  i have things to live for but i dont think i ll make it  i m getting a job soon and then going off to university  but i cant help but feel depressed and i dont know why no matter what happens to me i end up the same depressed and feelings of self loathing and think that everyone would be better if i just died and people forgot about me  my soul has been teared apart  i ve been able to function go to school look for a job and talk to people normally just so that people dont suspect anything  i even have a girl in my life that i care more about than anything in the world and it hurts that i cant see her  hear her voice and it even hurts in a way  i miss her so much  right now i am self isolating for covid 19  cant do anything except for playing the playstation which i dont enjoy anymore so i just lay in bed on my phone  i just want to scream  cry and run away as fast as i can from this mental illness i always like a piece of shit  think i never should of been born just a waste of my parents  money  i feel like a waste of time and shouldn t even be worth a second of anyone s time. why do i always feel like this someone please just help me.,7/2/21 15:49,yes
48816,okay  i ll do it  a positive post in r depression. but it is as it is   despite a few downs  i had no absolute breakdown since january. i wonder  my best friend is gone since january to...  but the break from the world trough corona helped me a lot as well.  i used to miss work at least once in two weeks  being absent regularly for 3 to 5 days  because i just couldn t do it. bosses are not happy  but made a last resort deal with me where i can work remotely if i m too depressed to come instead of calling in sick. i was sick a single time for 4 days  but that wasn t because of depression. aside from that  i haven t missed work since january. didn t even work remotely if we don t count the lockdown.  i m a little proud  but also worried of when depression will overwhelm me next time. it will come for sure  depression is not gone but i m just able to deal with it right now. my grandma is dead for one year next month too.,7/16/20 16:53,yes
58456,i m so tired of being me. i have done so many horrible things in my life and no matter how hard i try to improve i end up hurting the people i love in ways i never anticipated. recently i finally got the chance to date my bets friend of five years and it was wonderful  perfect  until i fucked up and drove her away. i hurt her in ways i never knew i could and never ever meant to. she means the world to me and now she hates me. what s worse is that in my life i ve had to deal with many traumas  between being assaulted and molested multiple times as a kid and never knowing how to have intimacy as a result i don t want to live anymore.  i betrayed my trust and hurt her  i didn t mean to hurt her and when i learned i had i did everything in my power to show my true and deep remorse. i hate myself for what i ve done. you can t take some things back and you can t learn to love when you re broken. all i ve ever wanted in life was love  ive lost the only person i ve ever loved and become the thing i hate the most in the world. i can t live on in guilt and pain. i m done i need to go. but i can t leave my family  my poor parents and siblings who love me unconditionally but can never know the things i ve done. i can t handle living with myself anymore.,8/22/20 17:38,yes
35240,i have been losing my love of life for a week now.  it started when i asked for outfit ideas on femboy forums and was contacted by a person who sent me 3 links that led to femboy s previous posts on reddit.  the posts contain things like digestion or cannibalism.  after all  i disgustedly saw my identity as a femboy and had no real motivation for it.  the word femboy only makes me sad and scared.  after all i was warned of operation pride case.  i quickly became uncomfortable and sad.  can someone help me please.,5/30/20 9:53,yes
189986,i ll get to the abusive part in a sec but here s some backstory to help explain. since a kid most people of my friends left me. they would be friends with me for years then make rumors about me  which weren t even true  and tell me to get out of their lives essentially. friends told me that i m the least favorite friend in the group  i wasn t good enough  too quiet  etc. mostly tearing apart who i was. skip to present day and now  i want people to tear me apart. im assuming this is some sort of comfort thing cause that s all i really know. it s even gone as far as me wishing i had super  verbally  abusive parents my parents aren t abusive i just don t  know  them and they don t know how to help emotionally . i search for the ways someone is being mean to me  and jump to huge conclusions just to feel a little bit of pain. super edgy  ik. i expect everyone to hate me. even acts of kindness  i just assume they re trying to get something from me. anyone have any takes on this or relate ,12/8/21 5:55,yes
59431,im a freshman in highschool and i honestly dont even think i have depression but i felt like this was a safe space to talk about my experiences. ive felt so lonely lately even though i know i do have a few friends who support me. but i just feel alone. i feel like i cant make any new friends in high school too because im the new kid and its online school. i have huge mood swings as well. like one minute im happy and the next im sobbing in my room for an hour. ive tried to talk about it with my mom but she just didnt understand and just brushed it off like it was nothing. and my dad would just tell me to man up. i feel like all these suppressed emotions from a few years ago when my parents got a divorce are all spewing out at once. i feel like im just alone all the time and i cant do anything about it. sry im not great at talking so this might not have made sense lol,8/26/20 2:26,yes

72666,past two weeks emotionally i ve been a wreck. i ve stopped taking care of myself and this morning it just all piled on at once. this won t be very coherent because i don t even know what to say. i m just letting it out here.   i broke down this morning. i cried. and cried. and had not so healthy thoughts that still haven t left.   i haven t showered all week. last two weeks i ve eaten nothing but garbage. i ve been forgetting to take my medical which i only have a few of. one of my medications is out and i need it to function like a normal human but since it s controlled getting a prescription every month is not easy. my boyfriend hasn t slept beside me in nights and at first i thought it was because he hated me but it could also be because i haven t showered. he s been passively aggressively throwing all my garbage on my side of the couch probably as a sign my piled up junk is too much. i have piles of bowls  cups  empty kleenex boxes from blowing my nose im allergic to the cats we have when they she d which it s been getting colder so more fur.    i thought maybe smoking would be an okay thing to calm me down but after two intakes that actually hit my lungs i ve had a non stop coughing fit. my breathing has been raspy and my throat burns. so last night i thought maybe if i drink booze i could forget it all. the last two weeks i ve had 3 entire bottles of jack but haven t felt even slightly compared. but for some reason between the lack of sleep due to coughing  wheezing due to allergies  and nose blowing i didn t sleep much.   instead this morning i feel exhausted  my lungs still bother me  my head is pounding and now i m sitting here at my computer taking calls getting yelled at by customers for things i can t control.   all i can think about is what a terrible person i am. how much i hate myself. how i see what a wreck i am  what a mess physically  mentally and other ways i am.   i can t stop crying.,10/16/20 11:44,yes

141845,    sometimes i wish i didn t exist. my own presence baffles me to the point where i lose track of time staring back at myself in the mirror. i look unfamiliar and don t often recognize the face in front of me. i am sensitive  often too sensitive.   i don t feel comfortable existing with this extreme extent of sensitivity  in a society where compassion and empathy are not significantly valued. i feel stepped on and walked over. i so desperately try to make myself larger  bitchier  harsher. i try to be more confident. i continuously fall short  and find myself crying in public bathrooms more often than i would like to admit.  i try so hard to put myself in a box that i don t belong in  and over the years have tried to change my personality to make other people more comfortable around me. i am so afraid of being told that people have to walk on egg shells around me or that i am being too dramatic. i am afraid that people will use my sensitivity as an excuse to tear me in pieces that are smaller than the ones that already exists.    i like to play pretend. i pretend that i am happy. i pretend to be carefree. i smile at my co workers in the breakroom and wipe my tears as i sit alone in my car.,6/20/21 13:41,yes

80944,i m not diagnosed  but i just feel really in a state of stasis.  let me explain. for the past 6 years  after my parent s divorce  i ve barely felt anything. i think this is because i repressed the emotions and the trauma. lately  it s been getting really bad and i ve been thinking about how i feel like everything is worthless. one thing that really uplifted me during the past year was the youtube channel unus annus  the concept of the channel is that markiplier and his friend ethan  crankgameplays would upload daily to youtube for a year and then delete the channel and every trace of it at the end of the year  and now that it s over  i feel like i have nothing to live for  if i could be so morbid.  i also find lots of comfort in the rare occasion when i m upset or angry  because i don t feel upset or angry barely ever. i cried for the first time in months yesterday. my s o asks me how i m feeling and i always reply  i don t know  because i really don t know.  i really like when i m in this empty state  because it s so familiar and has always been there. it keeps me from becoming too overjoyed or too angry. that might have to do with trying to take control of things i have no control over.  i guess i m just looking for words of encouragement or to know i m not the only one feeling like this. i m really losing myself here.  i m sorry if this was too long  thank you for reading.,11/16/20 22:41,yes
9436,does anyone else s sex drive go through the roof when they re in a depressive episode    the thing that really triggered this relapse was my emotionally and verbally abusive  live in  boyfriend breaking my car on valentine s day. the cops were called  i was terrified and devastated. he fixed my car by the next afternoon so i m letting him sleep on the couch until he find a new place. he also knows hes one more outburst away from a restraining order. he s been in prince charming mode and even scheduled a counseling appointment because he knows he needs to change and doesn t want to lose me  but i m still bed ridden  uninterested in everything  and tired.   the irony is that the only thing that makes me feel human anymore is by having sex with the guy that made me feel inhuman in the first place. and i don t have the energy or confidence  also his doing as i  would look better if i lost weight   to find anyone else to meet that need.,2/29/20 20:50,yes
174419,i wish there was more to say or something i could say that would redeem me from this  but i m truly not redeemable anymore. not after i broke the trust of the single person who loves me so deeply that he would marry a broken person like me.  but i deserve the vitriol and the disappointment. i deserve to be here. in the pit. except this time there s no hand reaching down for me because i deserve it.   there was only so much emotional support he could give me as someone who never experienced depression. and i wish he could understand what it feels like  but in the end he can only try and not truly feel it. so instead i turned to one of my friends  and we ve been on a fucking roller coaster of emotions since.  and so i emotionally cheated on my husband with my best friend. and of course he found out. and of course i deserve this. i already feel the downvotes and the comments telling me i deserve this  because i do. there s no way around it. i can t blame the drugs or my depression  because it was me.  maybe this will be the straw that breaks the camels back so he can finally hate me and i can kill myself.,10/15/21 5:08,yes
170530,because sometimes empty minded monotonous boredom  is better than the pure overwhelming self hatred i feel most of the time. i m a healthy young man that could work pretty much any job as long as he was instructed how to do so. but instead i m so mentally fucking tarnished that i squirm at the thought of even calling a doctor  or my internet service provider. my mom has so many health issues she can t work  and i want so badly to help but i just fucking can t. i hate myself so fucking much for it but i feel so drained just going to the store once a week  i can t work a job for hours every day. we have no money and i can t fucking do anything because my brain is a fucking piece of shit.,9/30/21 21:18,yes

3162,9 times out of 10 i see people wasting so much toothpaste or some other toiletry when they can still get a substantial amount of product from out of the tube. instead of squeezing the living daylights out of your toothpaste tube the next time you re low  just take 2 seconds out of your day and cut the thing in half. you ll be surprised to find out how much paste is left in not one  but both halves of it. and if you re worried about any remaining product drying out  just put one half of the tube into the other  that way you limit some of its exposure to air. this is only meant to buy you a couple days time until you buy a fresh supply. but it s extremely helpful in a pinch ,5/27/21 4:25,no

3126,my best guy friend of a couple years and i recently decided to try and see if things could potentially work out romantically. after a date  i realized that i was confusing my love for him as a friend for romantic love and decided to tell him upfront before it was too late. when i told him  he just got up and left  amp  has not talked to me since. one of my closest friendships for the past couple years ended so abruptly. i thought that after a bit of radio silence we would be friends again  but after he didn t wish me a happy birthday i knew that this friendship was truly over to him. i m just wondering if it would be super selfish of me to text him wishing him well so i could get some closure and move on as well.... or would it simply be better to just suck it up. there was just never a proper goodbye.,6/15/21 22:05,no

2530,i want to get to know my bfs best friends girlfriend but just is distant. she s cordial and friendly enough but she doesn t really open up to me like she wants to be more than acquaintances. the only thing i can think of why is that i hang out with a group of her former best friends. i don t know exactly what happened but i know that my bf best friend said that they really weren t good to her and her bf is not friends with them anymore just cordial. i hang out with them since i have no other friends. i knew they had a falling out before i started becoming friends with them but they are nice and haven t given me a reason to not be friends with them. they are really friendly and invite everyone to join. how can i be friends with them and their former friend  i really want to be friends with my bf best friend girlfriend so i can have a couple friend and her former friend group.,5/26/21 10:44,no
316,i ve had an on and off meditation practice for several years now  and learned many things along the way. it s been a positive thing in my life. however  one thing that has always haunted me during my sits is that i furrow my eyebrows almost constantly  to the point of having a headache sometimes. maybe every 1 in 5 sits i can settle in enough that this organically goes away  but most of the time it is a nuisance that stays with me well after i m done meditating. does anyone else deal with this  i m sure it s pretty common. apologies to the mods if this has popped up before.,2/15/21 22:57,no
11315,i live in an asian country where i tend to stand out. sometimes i find people staring at me. usually  if not always  it s out of curiosity  but sometimes i just don t want to be stared at.  rather than directly asking them  what s the matter  or similar  i act as if they re staring behind through me. i turn to look behind me then back at them. it immediately makes them self conscious and aware that they have been caught staring. i would say 9 times out of 10 they immediately stop. it s a pretty effective and polite way of drawing attention to their staring without having to directly confront them about it.,1/4/22 4:30,no
3007,let me ask you a question   who do you value the most and why . for me  it d be my friends and my family since they ve always been caring  kind  supportive and above all  honest  with me.  i met some people who didn t see it that way however. they viewed the value of someone by how much they had in their bank account or the piece of paper they got. money can buy a lot of things  but remember this to whoever out there reads this  no million dollars could buy a decent friend or family member  those people are priceless and they re also a wealth of knowledge that you won t find in a book. value the person by their nature  not their yearly earnings   have a good day night everyone  ,6/11/21 15:56,no
4930,i have a great friend who is fabulous and has been for me in many of my emotional hiccups and we have lot of fun together. i happen to have built a bit of a collection of high end designer purses. i have a few and to be honest it s taken careful planning of my finances but little by little have acquired them. he keeps on saying   let me borrow this one  or  the one you wore such time  honestly i don t understand how anyone has the guts to ask for such a favor. i was raised to not ask for anything loaned because it item could be lost  stolen or returned in bad shape and then friendship would suffer. i recently made another purchase and was tagged by the seller so this friend knows it will belong to my collection. his immediate response was  let me borrow it  to which i playfully replied  oh no sorry boo  i know it s material stuff but it has taken sacrifice from me to get them.  i am unsure how to state by boundaries about this topic. ideas ,8/12/21 9:25,no
3355,lpt every unmarried adult should have a health care power of attorney or appointment of health care agent completed. this will allow a parent sibling or other person to make health decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so. this also allows medical professionals to discuss your situation and care.   i got one for my college age children in case of emergency but now wishing i had one for an older unmarried sibling who is temporarily incapacitated.    i highly recommend having this in place.    an advance directive which dictates the level of care in extreme situations like a coma or life support is also important.,6/1/21 15:24,no

1226,this is a  sequel  post from my previous post  which taught you how to remove latex from aloe vera. i highly reccomend visiting my previous post as both posts combined with provide a complete learning oppurtunity  on how to use aloe vera.    https   www.reddit.com r lifeprotips comments mhi1fj lpt  how  to  properly  remove  latex  from  aloe  vera   https   www.reddit.com r lifeprotips comments mhi1fj lpt how to properly remove latex from aloe vera      in this post  i will be showing what to do after you have removed the latex from aloe vera  and how to extract the gel from aloe vera  which is used in creams and on skin products.       step 1.   cut long leaves in half to make them easier to process. you just want to cut them to lengths that will sit easily on your cutting board.     step 2.   cut off the serrated edges with a sharp knife     step 3.   remove the outer green skin layer with a knife  filleting the skin away from the gel inside. with the knife turned on its side  slide the blade under the skin along the whole length of the leaf  much like filleting a fish  trying to stay close to the skin as possible to separate as much gel from the skin as possible. you can also use a vegetable peeler for this task but make sure there is no green skin left behind in the gel though. skin removed from one side of aloe vera leaf  showing the clear coloured gel inside. if the leaves are a bit too wide  making them difficult to fillet  then split them lengthwise first to make the task much easier.     step 4.   when the skin has been removed from one side  carefully turn the leaf over  and remove skin from the other side  leaving the clear gel. the clear gel strips can also be gently washed under cold running water if you want to remove any remaining latex.     step 5.   cut aloe vera gel strips into cubes for storage or processing. the cubes can be placed into a blender and blended into a gel  or they can be placed on a tray covered with non stick baking paper  put into the freezer and frozen  then put into a tightly sealed freezer bag for storage  where they can be kept for up to six months. if using a blender to liquefy the gel  it will froth up quite a bit  so just let the gel settle and it will return to the correct consistency on its own.     step 6.   store aloe vera gel in a jar with a tight fitting lid in the fridge  where it can be kept for up to a week. just spoon out as much as you need to use at any time  it s always ready to use when kept this way. it s possible to extend the shelf life of home made aloe vera gel by adding various antioxidants such as ascorbic acid  vitamin c  and tocopherol  vitamin e   but finding the exact proportions to use and the expected shelf life from reliable sources is rather difficult. in the book  how can i use herbs in my daily life   by isabell shipard  she suggests adding 1 teaspoon of vitamin c powder to 3 cups of aloe vera gel and blending at low speed.     one large leaf will fill up a decent cup sized sized jar with home made aloe vera gel  and it s a fairly quick and easy process which only takes about 15 minutes   the leftover green aloe vera leaf skins can be put into the compost or buried in the garden to recycle the nutrients  so nothing goes to waste.     hope this helped.,3/31/21 19:11,no
6051,dogs do not know they are about to be in the heat for a long time  if you put a very small splash of milk into their water they with drink all of it  this works great for when you are about to go on a long walk  hike  etc.  still bring water for them while you are out so they can rehydrate.  do not force your dog to drink too much water  give them an appropriate amount for their size.  and only do this if your dog can have milk dairy. and of course if your dog does not like milk dairy this probably won t work.  this possibly applies to other animals  but i have not tried it.,8/11/21 15:15,no

98,i m an engineering student in college right now and i often wake up with a large amount of busy work with little to no motivation to start it. it s daunting for the brain to jump right into the largest task of the day  so something that i ve found helpful is waking up and doing a simple task  tidying up room  putting dishes away  things that need to get done regardless of workload . this simple task completion gives you a sense of accomplishment and fills up that metaphorical tank of motivation just a little  making it easier for you to then get to the meat and potatoes of the day.   hope this helps anyone who feels overwhelmed in the mornings ,2/8/21 15:20,no
5023,i m 2018  i had a really awesome roommate in college. at the beginning of our semester in college  we didn t really talk but eventually we became friends. going out to bars  football games  etc..  2019  we both had different roommates. we didn t see each other a lot like we used too. we only spoke to each other every now and then. but spoke to each other every other week.  not all the time   2020  i graduated and almost the entire year  we haven t spoken especially with covid going on and how crazy things were last year.   2021  this year  i haven t heard from him at all since may of 2020. that s 15 months of not talking to or seeing him.  i m thinking maybe our friendship has expired since it s been literally 15 months since we spoke or were we ever friends to begin with    what s your thoughts ,8/15/21 16:36,no

1011,more and more places require pets  especially dogs  to be microchipped. even where not mandatory  this can be a crucial step in helping carers and pets reunite in case the pet goes missing. since the pandemic  there has been an uptick in  dog nappings  due to a rise in demand for pets. dogs are stolen from their owners and sold to a new home  often unfortunately with no questions asked from the buyers.     here s what you can do to have a quick action plan in case your pet goes missing       all of the below applies to microchipped pets. i will be using the uk for example purposes only. please  research the applicable regulations and providers in your country of residence.     amp  x200b       once your pet is microchipped  ensure to register its chip number online and link it to your contact details. there are a lot of providers out there  so please research carefully before you make your choice.         as an example  you can find a list of providers in the uk that comply with government regulations  defra    https   www.gov.uk get your dog microchipped  https   www.gov.uk get your dog microchipped        the best way to choose a provider is to check that it complies with your local government regulations concerning pet microchips  most government websites would have some information concerning this published  and check their customer reviews.       it is not unusual to have a one off small registration fee per pet  using a uk provider as an example  this is gbp 12  and a small fee if your address changes  the same uk provider would charge gbp 6 for this . there are no other costs involved for a basic membership.  example used   https   www.pettrac.co.uk   https   www.pettrac.co.uk        important  ensure that you always keep your details  phone number  email  physical address  up to date in the pet microchip registry        save the contact details of the pet microchip registry in your phone. many of them offer 24 7 lost and found support numbers which is vital to have in case your pet goes missing.        if the microchip registry offers a 24 7 lost and found hotline  it is wise to have your pet wear a collar that has its name  microchip number  and the 24 7 number engraved on it.         this way if your pet is lost and someone finds it  they will have a  usually free  number to call that will be answered 24 7  and you will not have to give out your private details to unknown persons or get a new collar every time your details change. the registry will contact you and help you reunite with your pet.      ensure your current vet knows the microchip number  in case they weren t the ones who implanted it  and the provider where your pet is registered. ask them to save this information on your pet s record.      if your pet is prone to running away going missing or if you are especially worried  you can take these few additional steps so you have a complete plan of action  which hopefully you will not need        create a  missing  poster on your computer in advance  including the microchip number and 24 7 freephone number to call if applicable  so all you have to do is share it if needed.     make a list of where you would want to share the poster. do you want to print it out and post it in your neighborhood  do you want to post it in certain groups on social media specific to your area   missing pets  do you want to send it out to all nearby vets  have a list handy so if you need to  activate  your plan  you already know where you want to share your poster.    this way you already took some essential precautionary measures to increase your chances of locating your pet in case it goes missing. usually when such things happen  one tends to panic and other than searching the local area  doesn t know where to begin.   by taking the above steps in advance  you could put your mind at ease  a bit  knowing exactly what number to call to report your pet as missing and that if they are found  you have done everything possible to have them be swiftly reunited with you.   disclaimer  even by taking the above steps  there is no guarantee that every lost pet will be found. however  the chances of it increase significantly and may give you some peace of mind knowing that you have a concise plan of action for this scenario.   i hope this is of some help or at the very least offered some food for thought ,3/16/21 6:32,no
