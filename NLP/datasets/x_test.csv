161,i realize that this technique work in helping me identify my grammar problem. i have a great point in plotting  example  counter argument  etc. my weakness is that my grammar is bad. i rarely made any exercises to improve my grammar and in this pandemic situation  i have a hard time to identify what is problem in my essay. this method i was found when my classmate send me their file so i can check. every grammar error can be identified when the red line or blue line shows under the words. so  you dont need to use any apps to identify any grammar mistakes. the essay that i send to my teacher always in full colours because of this method,2021-02-11 08:41:26
80876,why should i care   why should i care if someone is happy in life   be at genuinely happy or just faking it   why should it matter to me   i should just be saying in my head   hey he s living his best life out there  good for him .    amp  x200b   now i m not a violent person by any means  i will never just randomly hit someone  but i am just angry  not at this random happy person  but at myself  for lacking the means to be like this random happy person  i am angry at myself  at my incompetency.   amp  x200b   another reason why i want to beat the shit out of this random happy person  is because in my head  i don t buy this happiness act  how can someone be happy in our society   with how things are   i feel like you have to have your head buried in the fucking sand to be happy with how things are  which i guess is contradictory to what i just said above  about me being angry at myself for not being happy  because if being happy means you have to be ignorant of things around you  why would i ever want to be happy   but hey i never said my emotions made any goddamm sense  if they did make sense  i would probably not be here  writing this shit of a post.   amp  x200b   maybe no one is truly happy in life   maybe those people that i identify as being happy are struggling just as much as i do  because other people expect them to be happy  because that is the norm  and if you don t appear to be happy or content with your life then something must be fucking wrong with you or something.    amp  x200b   i wouldn t say i m depressed  as in diagnostically depressed  from my understanding of depression  being depressed is not feeling   anything    being void of emotions  but i definitely feel something  i feel frustration  anger  and sadness. maybe i am depressed   i don t know really  and at this point  i don t think labels mean very much  all i know is  i m not content with my life  how it ended up  and where it is currently going  i m 23 without much going on right now  no drive nor ambition in me. i am extremely pessimistic  i only see the bad in things  and in people. i want to change  to see things differently  but it seems impossible.   amp  x200b   and if you re that happy random person walking down the street  although why the fuck would you be here if you were  then don t worry about me pummeling you  it s just a way to express my feelings  and please give me a manual to life or something  a  life for dummies  book or something  because i clearly suck at this thing.  thanks for reading through this whoever you are  i know i rambled all over  and didn t make sense  i guess it was just a rant that i needed to put out.,2020-11-16 18:19:08
7543, disclaimer  this may not work for all faucet types  if your faucet is leaking  the most common cause is a worn rubber washer in the faucet cartridge located under the handle. you can usually take the handle off and cartridge out by removing one screw  and this washer should be replaced  make sure you turn off the water supply to the faucet first  this is all common knowledge.   but if you need some time to find the right replacement washer  you can usually just flip the worn one to expose the unworn side  which will temporarily stop the leak while you find a suitable replacement. no need to waste water for days or weeks ,2021-09-22 13:31:22
192578,and now i remember why i ghosted him in the first place. he is my childhood friend and not a bad person  but he is one of these  just be happy and stop being depressed bro    guys. he thinks everything in life comes to willpower and basically doesnt believe in mental illness.   really felt bad after talking to him  was planning to visit him on monday after almost a year of not seeing him  but now i am having second thoughts.   as i said he is not a bad person but he basically sees me as a weak bitch and why the hell should i put up with that  i am tired of having discussions.,2021-12-18 16:01:54

51160,i really feel like either my depression is coming back or i m about to have a breakdown or something. i ve been in bed all week  usually only getting up in the evenings to then go downstairs and watch tv. i can t muster up the energy to do anything else.  i ve dealt with depression before and i really thought i had overcome it  i used to self harm but i m way past that now  it definitely has something to do with the fact everyone in my life is moving on and i m stuck in a rut that i can t seem to get out of. a year ago i lost my job  my long term boyfriend  pretty much my sanity too and i had to leave the little flat i lived in due to me becoming so depressed. everything i had worked for i lost. since moving house last year i ve been a lot better  made progress in little things  got a dog so i know i have some responsibility now which makes me not go into a complete meltdown. but i m still jobless  i rarely see my friends  they ve all got children and or partners  i live alone so it gets quite lonely. lately i ve just been coping by drinking but i noticed that it was getting a little bit out of hand so i have stopped. but when i drink  i usually feel really good  and productive and want to do all of these different things and i wish i was like this sober. but drinking isn t the way.   yesterday i tried telling 2 friends how i felt as i don t feel ashamed to speak up about mental illness  but they didn t really respond how i thought they would  i just kinda felt fobbed off so i just said that it didn t matter. ive also noticed recently a few people that i talk to on the reg have stopped talking to me as much so now i m over thinking wondering if i m just an awful person to be around. i really do try to positive and people keep telling me that things will get better but it it doesn t feel like anything is improving  mood wise. i know we all have problems in our lives  but it just sucks that even though i m going through all of this  i m still there for people despite barely seeing them or barely talking to them  i m not the kind of person who over thinks if a friend hasn t spoken to me in a few days or anything so that isn t an issue  i quite like my own space. but i ve been there for them so many times  i don t give to receive but in this instance  i feel lost and i don t know where else to go.   my last single friend recently got back with her ex  i turn 25 in november and i m just honestly freaking out about not having really anything in my life to be proud of. i ve been looking for work but it s still so difficult with covid 19  and i can feel myself slipping deeper into this horrible hole i feel stuck in. i never used to be like this  i loved living alone and being single and being able to be myself and not having to change for anyone etc. but now i find myself crying most nights  i can t sleep  the only sleep i get is a few hour naps here and there and i ve had this headache for like 3 days. i m so sick and tired of feeling like this and i always say to myself that i m gonna get up early and maybe go for a walk and do some exercise but i never do  i ve become so anxious to even walk out my front door  the only time i do is when i walk my dog and even then i still feel anxious and i don t know why.   i know my mum would support me and try to help but she got so worried last time as i ended up in hospital  i don t want her to worry again because it s not like that this time  it s literally just me feeling all of these sucky things   i think social media has a lot to do with it also  i get so jealous of everyone who can now go and see their big group of friends and they post everything and i just wish i had their lives. i have about 4 friends individually  we re not a group. everyone s getting married or pregnant and i clearly can t even hold down a relationship. me and my ex separated in may last year and while i was bad for a while  i got over it but recently he s been in my dreams and i m not sure why  sure there ll always be something there for him but i m not in love with him anymore.   often when i watch movies i just picture myself as them to just try and sort of escape my real life  it used to help but it s not really a permanent solution. i know this is long just reading this makes me think i m just so messed up  i think talking to a counsellor would benefit me but i don t have the money and it s a really long waiting list on the nhs. i just feel so lost and i can t seem to get out of this rut. has anyone else got any similar things they ve went through and how have you dealt with it ,2020-07-26 00:37:50
11134,while you may be content to abide by gender roles in your relationship remember that life skills apply regardless of gender. you should take time to learn how to cook  clean  properly do laundry  conduct minor repairs and maintenance on your home and recognize issues with your car. not only does it make you more knowledgeable  in the event that you do decide to hire out  and capable but it can help save you money.,2021-12-30 23:33:20
65212,i m just really not good for talking about it... i ve just always kept everything to myself and now i just can t. i ve lost the girl i love just cause i wasn t able to talk to her and now i ve hit rock bottom. i don t have a job and don t even have the energy to look for one  i stopped college. i don t know what to do anymore but i don t have the guts to get help... should i talk about it to the people around me or just go get professional  help  and how am even supposed to get help i m broke as shit... i really don t know what to do i just feel lost like it ll just keep on getting worse and i just wanna feel better,2020-09-17 08:07:50
160041,today is a shit day for depression. usually i am able to isolate my brain fucking with me and the truth. but  here i am in chronic pain of a gout attack able to barely crawl to the bathroom if needed. we have two dogs who i love very much but was not able to take care of properly. i asked my wife for help.   she eventually did it. my daughter just started college this weekend. and i came home to take care of the pets and my symptoms flared up. but i let her stay on the other side of the state to get more time with our kids.  they both go to the same school.    my pain got worse after she got home to the point that i was crying on the floor last night just trying to find some relief. and all she could do is tell me i was keeping her awake for her job the next day.   symptoms were worse by morning. can t get medical help because we can t afford it. and she just left me the dogs to take care of.   i did my best. she had to let our special needs pup in and feed them both. then she laid down for a nap. i tried to join her and she left the room. basically i disgust and repulse my partner. my adhd and depression has wreaked havoc on my employment.   and my health just keeps going down the shitter.   why should i live. just to wake up and be loathed every day.,2021-08-23 18:40:27

7346,this is my first post here. but i literally cant shake this stupid ass depression amd its all just being single. i know that it sounds stupid but  me thinking about how im single makes me go down a rabbit hole of  what ifs  and  this is why . i have a bone disease that makes my legs have a curvature in the ankles and knees so im short and have a weird structure sooo obviously this isnt helping my situatuon i never know how to think to get over it. i always say  your better off being alone  and  your gonna find someone in time  but then i look at myself and see how weird i look and how no one will ever love me for who i am. it keeps me up at night some nights and the only comfort i get is when i visualise myself at the top of a bridge and picture someone actually trying to save me and me just jumping so they can live with the idea of me killing myself and them never being able to see me agian so they know my life truly sucks,2020-02-23 14:53:21

3162,9 times out of 10 i see people wasting so much toothpaste or some other toiletry when they can still get a substantial amount of product from out of the tube. instead of squeezing the living daylights out of your toothpaste tube the next time you re low  just take 2 seconds out of your day and cut the thing in half. you ll be surprised to find out how much paste is left in not one  but both halves of it. and if you re worried about any remaining product drying out  just put one half of the tube into the other  that way you limit some of its exposure to air. this is only meant to buy you a couple days time until you buy a fresh supply. but it s extremely helpful in a pinch ,2021-05-27 04:25:50

158410,my therapist isn t working out for me. my old therapist  she quit on me and i moved to a different clinic  believed i had cptsd and reluctantly diagnosed me  she hated diagnosing. she thought it never helped the patient . i was also diagnosed me with major depressive disorder  panic disorder  anxiety disorder  social anxiety  and generalized anxiety by the psychologist at that clinic. my new therapist who will call x has said   i don t think you have all of these anxiety disorders. i don t see you having anxiety.  keep in mind that i barely see this guy once every 2 4 weeks and i ve been with him for 5 months maybe 6. so  he invalidates my fucking experiences with anxiety.  there is a reason i have all of these anxiety diagnoses  i could barely leave my home without having a meltdown 2 years ago. furthermore  he has retracted my cptsd diagnosis. he says it isn t in the dsm 5 which it isn t so he tells me that i display an overwhelming symptoms of ptsd instead. he tells me every session that he will reassess me for it the next session  he never does. i try bringing it up  he tells me   next session.  he wonders why i don t trust him. he hasn t given me a single reason to trust him. he refuses to reassess me.  my old therapist believed i displayed bpd symptoms. i have a huge list of trauma that coincides with bpd  such as abandonment throughout my entire life  unstable relationships  various forms of abuse i was forced to endure. my old therapist never diagnosed me with bpd. she hated diagnosing  thought i was too young to diagnose  and she left. i have brought up this to x  new therapist  numerous times and he tells me each time   do you even know what bpd is  have you done research on it  tell me then.  yes.. i have done intensive research on bpd. for months. just assess me  it isn t that hard. i either have it or not.  i opened up to him about a horrific traumatic sa that happened to me for a period of a year when i was a child and x told me   well...that s bad. but i can t report it and neither can you to the police. it s just not illegal anymore.   i opened up to him about my severely abusive father figure that was prominent in my childhood and he said   can you really blame him after what he went through    i am fucking sick of the mental health profession and at its professionals. i do not trust a single mental health advocate  therapist  psychologist  psychiatrist or anything in its realm. they have done nothing but invalidate me  made me cry  and made me rethink if what happened to me actually happened to me.  i have no clue where to go from here.,2021-08-18 00:34:49

75099,i been depressed for years and i always think about how a few months ago i was depressed  but i wish i could go back bcuz i wasn t as depressed as i am now.. i m not even searching for happiness at this point i just don t wanna feel this way..  its like my brain challenges itself to how much pain i can take  always reaching for the lowest point.. always reminding me of the good times and how happy i was a kid and my father was alive.. and reality hits me hard because those days will never come back.. my life is constantly going downhill and i m tired of it..,2020-10-26 19:24:00
32094,i purposefully stopped taking my medications because it was getting harder to be optimistic and high functioning when everyone in my dorm ignores every attempt i try to make to make this quarantine more homey and less like being trapped. i gave up on the night that i had planned a game night and not a single person of the 25 living in my dorm showed up. i was sitting in my room all dressed up  wearing mascara and my hair done staring at my door for 2 hours which constantly trying to convince myself that they ll show up  they re just running late. no one came and no one even apologised to me about it later  it was like i wasn t even a person worth it. and today i was staring at my phone for 4 hours waiting for this girl to text me back about when i could buy a cat off her. with each second i got more depressed and angry and pathetic and had to hold back from saying things i would regret. on tpp of that im experiencing really bad withdrawal symptoms and wont even bother trying to taking my meds because id rather suffer through it than think about all the girls that ive respected only for them to treat me less. what is it about me that people find so easy to just walk all over me and ignore me ,2020-05-19 17:14:10
55566,i don t really have people to share this with  properly  tbh i don t know how to share it with them because it ll make them sad or mad or whatever so hello void  it me again  i have come to whine again hello  how are you   it s super warm here now which is honestly so shitty. i just took a cold shower and it made the veins in my hands super visible and it freaked me the fuck out. idk how veiny people handle existing  my head just filled with the need to rip them out. i stare at my hands when i feel my head drift out of my body  when it s not  me   but i feel that s getting worse and i just phase out of myself  i don t think i exist and i m not anywhere near what i see in the mirror. i really can t be. i just don t feel like her  you know  i mean i know it s bullshit and i m just telling myself lies or whatever but i just can t shake the thoughts and things  going well  doesn t help anything    i thought this would change everything and i don t know if it would be like this if i was still on the same road i was on then but wtf    why do i still feel this way then  i worked so hard lately but all it gets me is fucking crying about seeing my veins lol     okay anyway thanks internet void i hope you re having a bearable day    ,2020-08-11 13:24:26

5760,recently i ve been feeling a little that meditation is having what seems like no impact on the levels of anxiety i feel. it may be that my expectations for its effects are too high  but i m starting to think it is too deep seated an issue for meditation to really help with. i ve also experimented with different kinds and not noticed one being more effective than another. honestly it feels like it does nothing  once i m placed in a situation that has caused me prior anxiety the 30 minutes of meditation i did in the morning and the calming effect of it vanishes.   i m just disheartened a little and hoping someone who s been through a similar experience can relate or give advice.,2021-12-21 09:48:11

152778,i have felt this way for so long i have always assumed it was normal  not so much that i was necessarily sad  but more often just numb  like i never really feel joy or excitement  although occasionally  i distinctly remember the occasions  i have noticeable sense of peace that cuts through my general sense of heaviness. i m not sure if this depression  and i haven t wanted to face it or label myself as such and be forced to deal with the reality of it if it is. i think i m having a hard time differentiating being depressed due to an internal chemical imbalance that needs to be reconciled  or just having a natural reaction to the state of the world or events  previous abuse  climate change  corruption  realizing you likely won t grow up to be what you thought you would be  the passage of time and loss of loved ones etc   or if that is a distinction that even matters ,2021-07-29 11:13:15
117187,i ve found myself in quite a dark place lately.  pandemic woes  isolation  recovering from spine surgery  losing mother to dementia...   i can usually dig myself out of a depressive episode with some go to activities like walking my dogs or exercising.  those aren t options currently since i have physical restrictions while i recover from surgery  happened about a month ago .  i m bored with tv.  i miss my friends  social distancing is torture for me . can t travel. can t vent to my parents since they ve got too much of their own worries.   does anyone have any suggestions for things that will make me happy  i m honestly really drawing a blank. i just want to sleep the days away but i know that s not healthy. the world is a dismal place and i m struggling to make sense of it all. no wrong answers  willing to try anything.,2021-03-15 12:28:19

187346,i have had severe depression and mild severe anxiety since i was about 16. was falsely accused of rape and my life has just spiralled ever since.   i m 24 now and the only relief i ve had in that time is the odd day here and there where i can keep my head above the water for more than what feels like half a second.   i ve been on multiple anti depressants  i ve been off anti depressants  i ve kept a good sleep schedule  i ve been to therapy for multiple stints  i ve exercised  i m in my last year at uni and just got some good grades back  i have no trouble with and am generally good at public speaking  i have a lot of friends  i have a great best friend of 20 years  i have some good people in my family  dad used to beat me when i was younger but we re mostly good now   i ve tried meditation  i ve tried ignoring it  i ve tried facing it  i ve tried all sorts of techniques recommended through cbt sessions  i ve tried illegal drugs that supposedly help  i ve removed caffeine from my diet  i ve moved to a new town  i ve moved back home  i ve had multiple girlfriends and have never had trouble with women  i ve talked about it with friends and family. i try my best to live every day to be a good person and genuinely do think i m a good person.   despite all of this  nothing offers any release.  last year i came close to suicide but i ve managed to stave off doing that since.  before things take a final turn  is there anything else anyone can recommend i try  i want to get better  i m dying to get better  i ll try anything  it s just that nothing works.,2021-11-29 00:50:46

84038,in march  i started taking wellbutrin and it was great once i got past the first few weeks with the side effects. however  the 150mg dose was not working anymore so i went up to 300mg. that worked until around august and then i started to feel really depressed again. then  i started on lexapro and i quickly realized it was not going to work with me. now  im on 50mg of zoloft along with 300mg of wellbutrin and it seems to be working well so far  it has been about a month  . this process has been pretty stressful and i know so many others struggle with this as well. basically  i am just curious as to when a person might know that their medication is the one for them,2020-11-25 23:31:10

69655,a piece of me died today.  i will type this here since i couldn t tell you.  i had thoughts of killing myself again on my birthday. i sat in my pitch dark room  having flashbacks to all those good memories we made together. i cried thinking about the cake i received for my birthday  wondering why i couldn t cut you a slice to enjoy it with me. i ve been having dreams with you in it the past few nights. i ve been having broken sleep cycles this past week  and i sometimes wake up gasping for you. you have changed my life in so many different directions  but in good ways. if i could go back in time  i would re experience that first night that i met you over and over and over. you are good for me  and i know deep down that i can be good for you too. i wish you would put a little more faith into me  and that you could believe that i ve been changing and working on myself to be a better version of me. i know you would try to stop your smile towards me if you randomly got to see me again in person. i know that when we re both hanging out  we both feel good. we get lost into each other in those moments and that is what life is about. those are the memories that we are supposed to remember for the rest of our lives.  i still love you. i still want you. i still miss you.  take your time. get your space.  i ll still love you. i don t think i will pursue another girl in my life again.  my heart will stay open for you. i ve made up my mind. so if you come back  then come back.  i ll be here. i ll try to keep living.  i hope you come around to being loved by me.  i hope time shows you it s possible.,2020-10-05 09:06:01

4970,hey. so i meditate daily and have been for over a year. today i meditated like i usually do and i probably went very deep into it. it felt that way afterwards atleast. when i was done meditating i had the word  elation  stuck in my head. i didn t even know what it meant and i don t think i ve ever heard the word before.   i m not english native speaking but i usually both think and speak english everyday . so what does it mean when you get a word stuck in your head after meditation  what does it mean  i am not hardcore i the spiritual stuff and meanings  i just follow what my hut tells me so i don t really know about terms and definitions people use. but it did feel like a unique and significant meditation session. so please if you have any interpretation of what it is when something gets stuck in your head like that or what the meaning of the  message  could be  please share with me. thanks.,2021-10-29 21:53:39

73408,how could i not be with the state of the world  i don t even mean the coronavirus. i can accept that. shit happens. it s a pandemic. nothing i can do about it. what distresses me is the leadership and utter hopelessness i feel as an american. i thankfully have a job  don t pay many bills so i m saving up for whatever  and i m in a relationship with someone who i seek to marry in the far future. but that s the problem. do we even have a fucking future to look forward to  and before you say get off social media  reddit is the only social media i use   drop the negative news  and live life  it won t make the pressing issues go away. i can t ignore just how bleak it all is. deleting reddit won t fix the hard problems that comes with being poor with limited social mobility. and that s all just me and my self centered problems. the world itself is regressing thanks to ignorance  incompetence  corruption  and stupidity. we deserve what s coming to us in the form of climate change. we have had every possible chance to combat our inevitable  mass self extinction suicide at every possible turn  yet we do nothing to stop it. so what s the point in striving for a better future  when there is none to be had  i just don t see it.,2020-10-19 10:17:41

146826,i am a 35 year old brazilian teacher  and i can t remember the last time i felt meaningful joy. i feel guilty by saying that because i have a nice family and a wonderful girlfriend and they love me and respect me so much  but i feel like crap. i did therapy on and off for around 10 years  i took medicine  i tried meditation... i have dreams that remain that  dreams. one of them is to write. i don t fantasize in becoming famous or anything  but whenever i sit down to write   after i read my production  it just sucks so much. it s anguishing to attempt something and realize that you re not good enough for that. i know that somethings require practice  but i don t feel that all the effort is worth it because in the end i always come to the same conclusion  i don t like life  i think i never did. i think i ve always looked for peace and happiness but i can t find it anywhere  not even inside of me. i just don t know what to decide  end everything or accept that i ll be forever unhappy until my natural non suicidal death. i think i just need someone neutral to talk  because i can t say these things to my family. brazilians are too emotional  sensitive and almost zero rational  so it s be inevitable to hurt someone if i shared what i actually think. i simply can t stand this place anymore.,2021-07-08 00:49:08

3126,my best guy friend of a couple years and i recently decided to try and see if things could potentially work out romantically. after a date  i realized that i was confusing my love for him as a friend for romantic love and decided to tell him upfront before it was too late. when i told him  he just got up and left  amp  has not talked to me since. one of my closest friendships for the past couple years ended so abruptly. i thought that after a bit of radio silence we would be friends again  but after he didn t wish me a happy birthday i knew that this friendship was truly over to him. i m just wondering if it would be super selfish of me to text him wishing him well so i could get some closure and move on as well.... or would it simply be better to just suck it up. there was just never a proper goodbye.,2021-06-15 22:05:07

48816,okay  i ll do it  a positive post in r depression. but it is as it is   despite a few downs  i had no absolute breakdown since january. i wonder  my best friend is gone since january to...  but the break from the world trough corona helped me a lot as well.  i used to miss work at least once in two weeks  being absent regularly for 3 to 5 days  because i just couldn t do it. bosses are not happy  but made a last resort deal with me where i can work remotely if i m too depressed to come instead of calling in sick. i was sick a single time for 4 days  but that wasn t because of depression. aside from that  i haven t missed work since january. didn t even work remotely if we don t count the lockdown.  i m a little proud  but also worried of when depression will overwhelm me next time. it will come for sure  depression is not gone but i m just able to deal with it right now. my grandma is dead for one year next month too.,2020-07-16 16:53:02
10569,it s all too common   when you start a new job and get enrolled into a pension scheme  they ll usually default to using your work email address. the one they just created for you when you started.  when you later leave that job  you ll lose access to the emails and will have no access to the pension. if you call them up you will usually be able to get it rectified  but you ll have to remember who you were with in the first place  which is easier said than done ,2021-12-17 05:40:53
58456,i m so tired of being me. i have done so many horrible things in my life and no matter how hard i try to improve i end up hurting the people i love in ways i never anticipated. recently i finally got the chance to date my bets friend of five years and it was wonderful  perfect  until i fucked up and drove her away. i hurt her in ways i never knew i could and never ever meant to. she means the world to me and now she hates me. what s worse is that in my life i ve had to deal with many traumas  between being assaulted and molested multiple times as a kid and never knowing how to have intimacy as a result i don t want to live anymore.  i betrayed my trust and hurt her  i didn t mean to hurt her and when i learned i had i did everything in my power to show my true and deep remorse. i hate myself for what i ve done. you can t take some things back and you can t learn to love when you re broken. all i ve ever wanted in life was love  ive lost the only person i ve ever loved and become the thing i hate the most in the world. i can t live on in guilt and pain. i m done i need to go. but i can t leave my family  my poor parents and siblings who love me unconditionally but can never know the things i ve done. i can t handle living with myself anymore.,2020-08-22 17:38:13

5519,hey everyone   i have been regularly meditating for around a year now and i am journeying down the path to finding my true innate being.  i have just had a very beautiful experience  whilst meditating i usually focus on the breath completely and get into very peaceful states  but thoughts always still invade the mind. tonight however i got into a state of bliss where i could witness my breath but also i was aware of all of my body parts  every atom of my being.  it was like i was away from my body witnessing my heartbeat and my senses and i got a very warm vibration take over me  like a tingling all over my body.  i had no thoughts or feelings for my 20 minute sitting and i feel like i have finally entered the true meditative state  and it was unbelievable harmony and bliss with the present moment.  has anybody else felt this  or is thisna well known step on the journey  any information would be great.  i wish you all  all the love in the universe  ,2021-12-05 16:47:26
72666,past two weeks emotionally i ve been a wreck. i ve stopped taking care of myself and this morning it just all piled on at once. this won t be very coherent because i don t even know what to say. i m just letting it out here.   i broke down this morning. i cried. and cried. and had not so healthy thoughts that still haven t left.   i haven t showered all week. last two weeks i ve eaten nothing but garbage. i ve been forgetting to take my medical which i only have a few of. one of my medications is out and i need it to function like a normal human but since it s controlled getting a prescription every month is not easy. my boyfriend hasn t slept beside me in nights and at first i thought it was because he hated me but it could also be because i haven t showered. he s been passively aggressively throwing all my garbage on my side of the couch probably as a sign my piled up junk is too much. i have piles of bowls  cups  empty kleenex boxes from blowing my nose im allergic to the cats we have when they she d which it s been getting colder so more fur.    i thought maybe smoking would be an okay thing to calm me down but after two intakes that actually hit my lungs i ve had a non stop coughing fit. my breathing has been raspy and my throat burns. so last night i thought maybe if i drink booze i could forget it all. the last two weeks i ve had 3 entire bottles of jack but haven t felt even slightly compared. but for some reason between the lack of sleep due to coughing  wheezing due to allergies  and nose blowing i didn t sleep much.   instead this morning i feel exhausted  my lungs still bother me  my head is pounding and now i m sitting here at my computer taking calls getting yelled at by customers for things i can t control.   all i can think about is what a terrible person i am. how much i hate myself. how i see what a wreck i am  what a mess physically  mentally and other ways i am.   i can t stop crying.,2020-10-16 11:44:04

141845,    sometimes i wish i didn t exist. my own presence baffles me to the point where i lose track of time staring back at myself in the mirror. i look unfamiliar and don t often recognize the face in front of me. i am sensitive  often too sensitive.   i don t feel comfortable existing with this extreme extent of sensitivity  in a society where compassion and empathy are not significantly valued. i feel stepped on and walked over. i so desperately try to make myself larger  bitchier  harsher. i try to be more confident. i continuously fall short  and find myself crying in public bathrooms more often than i would like to admit.  i try so hard to put myself in a box that i don t belong in  and over the years have tried to change my personality to make other people more comfortable around me. i am so afraid of being told that people have to walk on egg shells around me or that i am being too dramatic. i am afraid that people will use my sensitivity as an excuse to tear me in pieces that are smaller than the ones that already exists.    i like to play pretend. i pretend that i am happy. i pretend to be carefree. i smile at my co workers in the breakroom and wipe my tears as i sit alone in my car.,2021-06-20 13:41:54

178426,i used to feel this really overwhelming heaviness in my chest when i was really depressed. it felt like a cloud or like an ocean or like i was just breathing in a heavy fog. usually this also accompanied the urge to cry and then i d bang out some cathartic art and feel better  i dont want to cry anymore when im depressed. i dont feel anything. i wish i wanted to cry but i cant do it at all. i just feel so dull. completely silent. i try to make art to cope and my mind is completely blank. how can i get that heavy feeling back  it was so much better,2021-10-29 05:54:07
16941,he just let me know the other day he has depression. we ve been long distance for two months and on certain days  a couple times a week  he ll either leave me on read or not even open my messages  but he still keeps in contact with everyone else. he said it can be a chore to text me back sometimes and he feels bad for not doing so. he said he just wants to be alone on those days and not talk to anyone.      i don t know if this is the right place to ask  but should i obey those wishes  part of me wants to leave him alone but the other half of me wants to send him a message here and there just saying i m thinking of him. i m just worried and i don t know how to help.,2020-03-26 23:14:56
13303,first  here s some basic demographic information  just so we know who i am   i am 22 years old. i m from eastern kentucky  very southern  and attend ed  the university of kentucky. finally  i m an atheistic gay guy in a long term relationship that includes 3 years of living together as roommates.  now  i want to say that nothing above is really relevant. i ve had crippling depression since 16  am proud of my heritage  and i have a supportive family  i.e. i m treated as a son  not necessarily a gay son or an atheist son   we have mutual respect for our differences.  what is relevant is that i don t know how i m going to survive life. i am medicated and see a psychiatrist at least monthly.  i started treatment fall 2018  when i withdrew from college in order to get medications sorted get back on track. everything seemed to be okay  i did well last semester  and now i ve had to withdraw again. i m right back where i was a year ago. i love my program of study and my school. i m confident that it is not the problem. at most the stress exasterbates the problem.  that being said  last week i went to a professor for help asking for leniency to get caught up i have a letter of accommodation and my school s disability resource center allows me to have attendance flexibility due date flexibility . the professor refused. okay  not a big deal  really. the issue is that he closed the door and lectured me for at least half an hour about how everybody goes through problems  about how his nephew failed out of college causing him to be depressed  and generally just underminding what a disability is. i attempted to leave twice because he brought me to tears with the berating  which also caused me to get angry. he kept telling me to sit back down. i m a polite person  so i just didn t respond until he lectured out  then i left. he insulted my intelligence several times. to say he has a mightier than thou complex is an understatement  as i am aware and was aware that he is an intelligent individual. there was never a question. however  he knew exactly what my life problems and internal situations were  apparently. he interrupted me when he asked a question. he assumed me to be someone i m not from the ground up  and he wouldn t let me say who i am. apparently  i am a dumb country boy who misses home and forsakes my responsibilities.   i m aware i can get him into trouble  and etc. however  i don t want to be in a class with somebody like that  so i just dropped the course. i have a full ride scholarship  but i ve officially withdrawn from the university and basically i have thrown it away. my gpa isn t in the shitter because i ve been able to withdraw 3 times now. i could probably go back but it s a bad idea and i know it.  the thing is  that s not an uncommon reaction by professors  i ve noticed. there are some who are absolutely amazing  and we usually set up a plan at the beginning of the semester  and there is no problem. the rest just want me to email them if anything is up. i do  then they tell me i need an excuse rules say i don t   that they don t approve of the behavior  or outright ignore me. i ve never asked for anything grandiose. it s at most extensions.  after i got out of the office with that professor  i had one of the worst breakdowns of my life. i sat in my car crying for about an hour  then pulled myself together enough to drive 5 minutes home  then isolated myself and continued wallowing. i m not sure if it was some sort of manic decision or what  but i then decided to completely withdraw  not just his class.  i m thinking i m going to take time off again. i m not sure it will end any differently  but i ve decided to go to school a little closer to home  which entails probable loans  moving  and throwing away everything from before. the reason i m choosing the school is purely logical  price and programs available. it at most shaves 30 minutes off a 3 hour drive  so i m not sure that my impression that it s closer to home is even true  really.   my internal dialogue says this is going to end the same way  and that i should just drive off a cliff  or whatever. i just don t know if i can trust my decision because i m at the bottom again  and i know i make awful decisions while depressed. i just let life go and cease caring  which later creates a vicious cycle in which my previous decisions cause me to constantly try fixing everything  which is exhausting and i become depressed  rinse and repeat.  is it a manic decision to completely uproot and move  i recently spent close to 5k in a manic decision  so i have no idea. i feel like my guiding compass is blacked out  somehow.  i really don t think school is an issue academically  but the culture may just be wrong for me. i don t know. but i ve been someone with major depressive disorder since 16  so i know my episodes don t always have a cause or source. it just happens. the best i can usually do is mitigate and stop it from going too far.  i am thinking i m probably bipolar  but that s not an issue i want to think about right now. i have an appointment  and i m sure the doctor will have an insight.  failure used to be my worst fear. this whole thing has made me question whether i am  in fact  an unintelligent country boy who is depressed out of convenience. i logically know that s not the case. the dark spot is just looking for doubts and guilts.   i m not sure what i need to do going forward at all. i have no idea where i am at in life. i have no idea how i am going to financially make it  thankfully rent is paid through august . energetic me wants to completely reinvent myself and everything around me  fuck the cost. depressed me can t be bothered to care. it s like i m walking into fire intentionally. i just don t care.. at all. about anything  myself included. it s not even an evident sadness at this point. i just don t care about the consequences of everything to the point i m willing to just sabotage everything  i think.   it s really hard to explain  and school is really only an example  and there are a lot of details being left by the wayside  of course.   i m not really sure what i m asking of you  fellow redditors. this is somewhat a vent  and somewhat an open ended question. what do you think  i guess   sorry about the length. my mind is cloudy and disorganized right now.,2020-03-12 18:39:10

80944,i m not diagnosed  but i just feel really in a state of stasis.  let me explain. for the past 6 years  after my parent s divorce  i ve barely felt anything. i think this is because i repressed the emotions and the trauma. lately  it s been getting really bad and i ve been thinking about how i feel like everything is worthless. one thing that really uplifted me during the past year was the youtube channel unus annus  the concept of the channel is that markiplier and his friend ethan  crankgameplays would upload daily to youtube for a year and then delete the channel and every trace of it at the end of the year  and now that it s over  i feel like i have nothing to live for  if i could be so morbid.  i also find lots of comfort in the rare occasion when i m upset or angry  because i don t feel upset or angry barely ever. i cried for the first time in months yesterday. my s o asks me how i m feeling and i always reply  i don t know  because i really don t know.  i really like when i m in this empty state  because it s so familiar and has always been there. it keeps me from becoming too overjoyed or too angry. that might have to do with trying to take control of things i have no control over.  i guess i m just looking for words of encouragement or to know i m not the only one feeling like this. i m really losing myself here.  i m sorry if this was too long  thank you for reading.,2020-11-16 22:41:13
9436,does anyone else s sex drive go through the roof when they re in a depressive episode    the thing that really triggered this relapse was my emotionally and verbally abusive  live in  boyfriend breaking my car on valentine s day. the cops were called  i was terrified and devastated. he fixed my car by the next afternoon so i m letting him sleep on the couch until he find a new place. he also knows hes one more outburst away from a restraining order. he s been in prince charming mode and even scheduled a counseling appointment because he knows he needs to change and doesn t want to lose me  but i m still bed ridden  uninterested in everything  and tired.   the irony is that the only thing that makes me feel human anymore is by having sex with the guy that made me feel inhuman in the first place. and i don t have the energy or confidence  also his doing as i  would look better if i lost weight   to find anyone else to meet that need.,2020-02-29 20:50:17
4071,you would not believe how much this actually works. worst case scenario  the full line winds down all the way to one of you  so you had to wait long. best case scenario  before the first person on the long line is even done ordering  the closed line gets opened  so you get an easy  amp  quick order.,2021-06-20 21:59:09

1100,when you travel outside of north america  you ll find that the coke tastes different. one reason for this is that they use sugar  rather than corn syrup. if you like sugar sweetened coke better  find a jewish area near around passover. corn derived foods aren t kosher for passover  so coca cola makes batches of sugar based coke during this time of year  but you have to be quick because once they re gone  they re gone.,2021-03-28 14:15:41

18803,so i am a 16 year old male  and everyday i think about how my sexuality is one day going to take everyone i love.   my family is really religious  but not in a way where they force me to be super religious. so if i come out my family would think that it would be their fault for not raising me stricter. im also religious   i try to be its difficult with the whole gay thing . i have tried to listen to scholars on their opinions on homosexuality and its either that we are all evil and posseses or that god gave us urges and that we must not act on them. it just doesnt feel fair. i really tried to not act on them but it doesnt feel that healthy. everytime that i got a crush on a guy in my school i would pinch myself or curse myself out in my head when i would talk to him. it made me want to commit suicide  but i still believe in god and really don t want to do that.   i live in a western country so i actually do sometimes see gay teens in my schools and i just cant talk to them or be their friend because people would see me even talking to then and then the news that i was gay would spread to the whole school and then to my family.   the worst part of my life isnt even the gayness. its the fact that  everyday i am being meaner and angrier at people. i used to be real nice  but its really hard to show kindness to people these days with all the self hate i got inside me its like something in my soul flipped one day and made me so nasty and mean.  hearing my family and the 2 friends that i have talk about gay people is just so painfull. my mom says that they are just as bad as pedophiles. i love my mom  but everytime that she says that i want to just move out and never look back.   maybe someone reading this would understand what im going through,2020-04-02 18:16:28
174419,i wish there was more to say or something i could say that would redeem me from this  but i m truly not redeemable anymore. not after i broke the trust of the single person who loves me so deeply that he would marry a broken person like me.  but i deserve the vitriol and the disappointment. i deserve to be here. in the pit. except this time there s no hand reaching down for me because i deserve it.   there was only so much emotional support he could give me as someone who never experienced depression. and i wish he could understand what it feels like  but in the end he can only try and not truly feel it. so instead i turned to one of my friends  and we ve been on a fucking roller coaster of emotions since.  and so i emotionally cheated on my husband with my best friend. and of course he found out. and of course i deserve this. i already feel the downvotes and the comments telling me i deserve this  because i do. there s no way around it. i can t blame the drugs or my depression  because it was me.  maybe this will be the straw that breaks the camels back so he can finally hate me and i can kill myself.,2021-10-15 05:08:29
4437,i have noticed that meditating had lead to a heavy improvement in my mental health.  but....one more thing which is happening is a kind of weird.  coming to the point  i even stay calm enough and can hear blood circulating inside my subconcious brain region as if....there s water flowing aggressively in a pipe don t know how else to describe it .  any idea what could this thing possibly be   all answers opinions possible answers are welcome.,2021-09-27 10:02:17

6253,many  many  years ago i was 19 and suddenly on my own. i knew how to cook basic things like spaghetti or eggs  but making a big dinner was out of my grasp. it took a lot of trial and error  and some hungry nights to realize i had to play catch up. eating frozen entrees and sandwiches can only go so far  and eating out gets expensive quick.  if you re able to learn your parent s recipes take the time to do that  and cook with them. i miss my mom s food and  recipes so much  but she passed away suddenly and that knowledge did also. when you re on your own  you will be so grateful you took the time to learn.,2021-08-17 01:08:03

5211,so before school started  i started talking to this guy who s the same year as me. i think we ve had some pretty nice conversations and we started talking two sundays ago. after a few days talking on instagram dm  he asked for my snapchat and we started talking there. after that  he was moving in and we ve been talking increasingly on and off bc of being busy. he mentioned sunday that he wanted to hang out. monday i suggested hanging out either later that evening  or the next day. we ve still been talking very on and off and he tends to open my message and then leave me on read for a day before responding. now he s left me read for more than a day and i can t tell if he doesn t want to talk anymore  or is just really busy  or forgot.  overall  almost all of my friends have said that he sounds like he s actually interested in talking and being friends and isn t dry  so i m just confused as to why he s like this now.  we re both freshmen in college and the past week has been a lot with moving in  meeting new friends  and starting classes  so i do understand that he could just be busy  but i m really not sure because if he has the time to read my messages then why wouldn t he respond. or maybe i m wrong lol idk.,2021-08-20 23:38:09

2767,my tried  amp  tested trick when receiving a creepy comment from a grown man  esp older ones  is to laugh at the creepy comment  amp  ask what his name is. no matter what he answers  tell him it s your dad s name. 9 10 times for me this helped correct that behavior real quick.,2021-05-16 21:22:41
34723,life is endless solitude. i m trapped in my bed every fucking day. while media portrays people my age having friends  and sex and good times.  there s no escape from this.   i hope there is an afterlife. i don t want laying in bed to be the only thing my soul experiences.  i feel like i m living in the worlds most boring horror movie.,2020-05-28 11:17:43

198183,ok  so ill start off by telling you that im 16  i have autism and depression and anxiety problems.  i ve been on  175mg sertraline  ssri pills for 2 years now.  these past few months has been harder on me  i go to school everyday  people appreciate me  and the enviourment is pretty good compared to the past few years. theoretically  it should make me feel good. i think my pills are losing their function  i m anxious and depressed.  i ve stopped going to school for about  1 2 weeks  now. its just too much. i told my psychiatrist all about that and he told me to switch to prozac  a new ssri.  im weaning off the sertraline now  of course i still feel shitty  i expect to feel shitty for the next 5 months  at least untill the new ssri starts working.  im still not going to school  i dont think i will anytime soon. my idea of a  best case scenario  would be that my psychiatrist would give me a benzodiazepine that would help with my anxiety immediatly.  i cant wait 5 months for the new ssri to take effect. i told that to my parents  my mom just keeps saying that it will get better and i just have to wait and be positive. i dont think thats a good atitude  because im in serious need of change. i cant contunue like this.   amp  x200b   am i looking at this that right way  what should i do ,2022-01-10 08:49:00

618,hey  i ve been practicing mindfulness for a couple months now and i m really enjoying it. i ve also been researching transcendental meditation  mainly through some david lynch interview videos lol  and it sounds like something i d love to try.  does anyone here practice it regularly and can reccomend some websites or guides for beginners  as i know it involves different techniques.  i want to avoid paying for a teacher or course etc. just wanna try it out  as i hear it has many benefits that mindfulness doesn t necessarily offer.  cheers,2021-03-03 15:07:17
195083,i ve pretty much given up on the concept of attaining peace. ik life is just down to perspective but my life sucks. i only turned 18 last month and i pretty much don t have anyone in my life that appreciates me or shows that they care about me including myself. i attempted to do it when i was 13 and the tie i used broke  and i kinda wish it worked back then. i m planning on doing it on the 2nd of january 2022 this sunday. it s pretty much my last week hopefully. and ik that i ll probably hurt ppl but i honestly don t care  no one should be hurt excessively as no one does anything for me at all. i m not even leaving anyone a note because no one has ever given me closure in my life. life is just pointless for me atp ppl say  it gets better  but why should i wait for that. death and pain are the only things certain in life and i ve convinced myself that im not being selfish because why can t i make the rescission the unalive myself if im going to die anyways  ,2021-12-29 05:25:01

128898,i don t understand how i lost everything so fast.   everything was going fine  moving to another country  finding a good job  my bf for 12 years coming with me and finding also his dream job  nice flat  a dog  even with the pandemic it was bright.   and then  since january it s falling apart. major leak in the shower  there is constant workers in the flat and no shower yet so no more relaxing time  lost my job  the job center here is a nightmare i don t know if i will be able to receive some money from it as i receive constantly letters saying it lacks some documents  it s taking forever and they are not speaking my langage is really challenging  after more than 50 applications i still have no job as a new law has been voted and no one now wants to hire me  i don t have any friends in this country so no social life  didn t see my family for a year because of covid  and now i just learned my bf was cheating on me.   i didn t even cry. i am so sick of all this shit. just want to leave. but i don t know where to go  i am loosing all my spared money on taxes and health insurance.   i just sleep all the time  and can t eat anymore  feel like i will never be able to laugh anymore.   i was so happy in 2019 i am so empty now  i don t know how to keep my faith in the future.,2021-05-06 10:54:21
177229,so.... today i wake up to learn that my credit card was cancelled after 1 month of owning it.... they cancelled it because i somehow accidentally put in my wiring number instead of my routing number  and tried to pay off my card in full only to have the payments come back returned...i even found the error and resolved it myself before the cycle ended  and even paid the returned check fees.... so they finally accepted my payment and now i have to wait to see if capital one is feeling generous enough to give me my card back...  i went to go visit my newborn niece a couple weeks ago  and i couldn t help but notice there were no pictures of me in my sister s house.... at all.... not even of when i was at her wedding.   i just feel myself slipping further into my depression everytime i m alone now....  i want to tell my parents that they don t have to worry about me anymore.... but i can t help but feel like i m nothing but a loser to them.... sometimes i just feel like it s more out of pity than love....  i want to keep trying. i want to believe i can turn this around and make something of myself.   maybe i just hate myself more than i can ever admit.... maybe there s this subconscious part of me that doesn t believe i deserve better which is why i always somehow manage to fuck things up for myself.  i almost can t blame my sister though.....i love her but..... as screwed up as our family is  i m glad to see that at least one of us will be ok..... it s not like i ve done anything relevant.... not married.... no kids....  how do people do it  they just seem..... happy.,2021-10-25 07:27:50
112119,i recently failed a test twice  and the 2nd time i failed it by  2 points. now i will be dropped from my job and i honestly feel depressed. i feel embarrassed  my manager said i could take it on my own and come back  but i just feel so dumb  amp  stupid. i studied for 2 months straight and failed by 2 questions. idk how to build the motivation to keep going. i think maybe i also feel this way due to staying at home the whole time  today  i basically did nothing at home and feel even worse. i m just unhappy. idk what to do. i m so confused. how do you guys keep going  or get back to  feeling normal . i m thinking maybe i ve been feeling depressed for a while and studying working just kept my mind busy  all my co worker friends will be moving forward  but it s weird because i don t even see them often  but i still feel dumb and embarrassed because i m behind now and basically demoted until i pass this test.,2021-02-22 02:35:57
62551,   right now i m awaiting test results that will determine if i have cancer. my doctor was very concerned about some growths in the back of my throat and honestly all the pictures online of throat cancer look very similar. i m only 21 years old. though i guess it could be something else. he said hed never seen anything like it. so now  i ve had to quit smoking and i am going through hellish withdrawals. at work theres a lot of slack i have to pick up because of drama and people quitting. i have a fulltime amount of college units that i m working on 4 5 hours a day  i m working on moving out and getting my own place  i have to take care of my elderly grandmother with dementia  i have pets... all while having been depressed for the last 9 years  starting with the loss of my religion and being compounded by teenage opiate and benzo abuse  psychedelic hero doses  and the death of my mother and other closest family member.   i m sick all the time even though i exercise and eat well. also i cant lose weight even though i live a healthy lifestyle  minus the cigarettes vape which i ve now quit   i m nearly 200 lbs and 6 0 tall with like 25  bodyfat. i only eat like 1500 calories a day right now and have been for 4 or 5 months. barely kept off 5 lbs. so idk what s wrong with me.   i am disgusted by my appearance. i m one of those people that simply looks autistic. i have childish yet asymmetrical facial features  cowlicks in my hair  my head is rather small compared to my body. i could never be happy with how i look even if i was in good shape. because of this i ve never had a girlfriend. i ve had girls try to date me but honestly when you grew up being constantly bullied by both boys and girls  you begin to hate them in an immeasurable way. i fantasize about killing women to sum it up  not that i d actually do it. but yeah  i m not sexually attracted to guys  i just avoid women because i want to hurt them since i hate myself so much. pretty simple psychology i guess you could say. still  i obviously want to feek connection with women and i am sexually aroused by them  so that just further complicates my position and makes me feel pathetic.   i have hobbies but i dont really enjoy them anymore. hiking  playing guitar and piano and a few other instruments  writing poetry and raps  hunting  and also just helping other people whenever i get the opportunity to. that s something that helps me think less about my suffering and get out of my head. i have friends but most are bad influences that i m trying to convinced to change their ways while they slowly erode my integrity. but i ve changed a lot of their lives for the better by getting them off hard drugs  helping them to be more self aware etc...   still  i m on the path to nowhere good in life. just because i have a high undergraduate gpa and a steady job and goals doesn t mean i m happy. i m so... frustrated at life and i cant do anything to feel happy about what it has to offer. when i think about reality and the nature of our free will and the fact that there is no inherent meaning... everything falls apart and i want to implode into nothingness. sometimes i just curl myself into a ball at the end of my bed and scream and pound my head into the wall. stuff like that  simply because i dont know how to get this anger at existence out. i am disgusted by what i see on a daily basis and even more disgusted that i cant just be normal and enjoy what life has to offer.   part of me just wants this to be stage 4 cancer so i finally have an excuse to just give up.,2020-09-07 06:08:59

120887, from a high paying  high alert job to struggling in the 1 year lockdown. thinking of giving up my 8 dogs whom ive cared for so much in 6   2 years. recently quit a job due to toxic boss as i am the manager of the team  teammates felt were being attacked unnecessarily. in january  fixed my dad s problems and he ended up leaving my rented apartment due to sadness at home. 350   job applications passing interviews but only three great job offers that did not push thru. was offered a best position by a controversial politician but my morals dont align. now  i suffer. too much pride  must be my line of work and the values it taught me. must be over caring for people and not leaving something for myself. must be too much idealism. i got depressed  went to therapy the whole lockdown. sought only close family member i have but i think hed like for me to figure things out on my own. planned to use my savings in my masters studies but ended up in the pandemic cage. worst time to be alive. sometimes i think of just resetting life and leaving this world. writing here seems to be the only safe space. to everyone reading  thank you in advance for any thoughts. let s all take care.,2021-04-06 07:34:58
7369,not only is it great to keep for your own records  a lot of doctors want to see the actual scans themselves and not just the report.  in addition  you can create a copy of the cd and download it onto your pc so you can re create the cd if it gets damaged  or a doctor loses it.,2021-09-17 17:24:15
16869,recently i ve been having a lot of really low points. it feels like i m overwhelmed by emotional pain. ik pain is something you associate with physical pain but i dont know how else to explain it. almost like being stabbed non stop with sadness. and all i want to do when it happens is for it to end or to physically hurt myself. i have no control over it happening and when it happens i just have to take it and be in a lot of pain. i can be ok then all of a sudden it hits me and this usually stays for a few hours in a bad state. im not sure if this is the right place to put this. but honestly i dont know why it keeps happening like my life should be fairly good rn compared to before and it s not even like theres something that triggers this it just happens. i was wondering if theres someway to stop it as it s a lot to deal with.,2020-03-26 18:44:39

6925,around this time last year  i started to spiral into a deep sadness. it continued throughout the year and flash forward to one year later today  i still feel incredibly deep sadness.   initially i thought it was just sadness from the stress and anxiety in my life. i figured once xyz problem was taken care of and solved  i d be happy again. except once xyz problems would pass  i found myself still with this depressed fog clouding my vision. i d catch myself laughing and enjoying myself while out at dinner with friends  but meanwhile in my head was this depressive fog fighting continuously to come out  and i knew the second i got home  i d just crawl into bed and be sad again.   i don t have the energy to be as socially active as before  and even when i did muster up the strength to go out and hang out with friends  that depressed fog just keeps lingering around me. i ve stopped putting much effort into how i dress. i want to hang out with friends so bad but many days i end up alone at home all day. i ve lost 20 pounds. i had to call out of work for the first time earlier this month because i just couldn t stop crying.   i went to the doctor to get bloodwork done because i keep thinking to myself  i can t possibly be depressed. it must just be some kind of vitamin deficiency that is causing low moods. once we fix that   i ll be good  except the bloodwork came back all perfect. thyroid levels normal. vitamin d normal. b12 normal. magnesium levels normal. etc.   i ve been so irritable  quick to anger and to snap at people that i ve burned bridges with many friends lately. i don t know what s going on. i don t feel like myself. am i depressed ,2020-02-22 07:14:34
176554,for a while know i ve felt real down and lost in life. i spend my time at home most of the time  stuck in a dumb routine. school  procrastinate  homework  waste a lot of time  repeat. all my days are the same  but i feel like i can t really get out of it.   no one in my family really seems to care to listen to me. my mother never takes me seriously and just uses me as a free therapy sponge  every time i go and talk to my sister she is always annoyed at me  my dad doesn t really live with me and most of our conversations are questions and answers.   i feel lost. i want things. i know what i should do. i make plans and try to follow through. i hit a roadblock and even though i don t want to go back  i let myself slide back into the bad routine.   there are times when i don t even enjoy what i m doing. with school  i m just going because its just two more semesters and i get the title.   once i enjoyed videogames but now it just feels like i m forcing myself to play just to stop thinking or to be nice with my friends whenever they want to play.   for the last year and a half  the days have been the same. only slight changes. i ve nearly wasted 1 10th of my life doing nothing.  how can i stop self sabotaging  how can i drop the videogame  videos  and tv binging addictions  how can i make myself productive  how can i be healthier  how can i feel happier   i really want to improve  i want to succeed in life. i just feel so stuck.,2021-10-23 00:52:14

7615,  always understand that when asking for advice on the internet it will be biased towards the kind of people that hang out on these forums  and to those that take time to reply.    never make life decisions  eg career moves  investment decisions  what to major in  actionable relationship advice  actionable medical advice  based solely on advice you get online. always supplement by speaking to a professional or at least real people in your life that understand your full context  socioeconomic  personality etc .   you should only rely on reddit internet advice if you re asking about something technical factual  think  how to configure my router    and on a topic specific subforum that has exactly the people you re interested in hearing from  in this case you would be fully aware of the sample bias .   ps i am aware of the irony of this post  but it s something people just need to be reminded of  especially when they don t have a lot of people in their life to turn to for advice.,2021-09-24 10:59:07
6923,i m not claiming that it s ok to lie to someone because they ll judge you for the truth  but the reality is that a lot of people will tell small or big lies to get what they want if they feel you won t give it to them they re honest. this could be in any situation.  i m not saying you have to be ok with everything someone tells you  but if you hear people out and are understanding  you re giving them less of a reason to lie to you.  yes  i know that people should just not lie  and i m not blaming you one bit for being lied to  but we live in a reality where people lie. you can either do something about it or continue being lied to.,2021-09-05 12:34:15

89145,like the title says not taking care of yourself can make your suffering worse in the end in my case im doing kinda better now but for me it wasn t brushing my teeth because see if you dont shave or shower or wash your clothes that all can be fixed relatively easy you can wash the smell away you can cut the hair away but because i wasnt taking care of myself teeth included i know have multiple cavities the line where my teeth meets my gums has become weakened which has allowed plauq to build up and create a few cavities on the front of my teeth and they are a nice shade of dull yellow and it s hard because my day can be going amazing but the moment i see my smile or feel an pain in my teeth its a reminder of the darkest time in my life and it s going to cost me thousands of dollars i dont have to get my teeth into proper shape and to even feel comfortable smiling around people and then on top of all that when i go to my dentist im insulted about my teeth and hygiene and then called a lier when i try to explain my situation im sorry if this has turned into an annoying rambling the main point of this is to just get this out and i beg of anyone else going through hard times i know it can seem impossible do but please i beg of you dont be like me and not bruhsh your teeth atleast do it once every few days or go over it once a day even if only for 30 seconds  you dont want to come out of your depression only to be pulled down by something that could be avoid so easy this may all sound stupid but i just felt like i needed to say it even if it only helps one person,2020-12-11 00:27:08
11227,a lot of restaurants will advise you that you must leave your table by a certain time as the table is reserved for another party after you. this may not be a concern for you unless you like to order a bottle of wine and take your time  or just stick around for a few more drinks. if you are the last party reserved for that table you can stay much longer and will receive more attentive service as the servers are no longer rushing and preparing for a  flip .  source   am a bartender in a high end restaurant. vancouver  canada,2022-01-01 18:02:26

128418,after doing lsd a few times i thought it d be a good experience to try shrooms  the three times i ve done shrooms i ve felt worse and worse after every trip. i no longer relate to my friends or myself the same way  i have no grasp of my own identity and don t know how to escape the constant fog that veils my existence.  my anxiety has skyrockets whenever i m with someone who i sense is dominant to me  whether that be how they speak  how they carry themselves  or their appearance. i constantly question  am i normal  i can t relate to these people how i used to.  even at family gatherings i ll go from having a tolerable mindset to feeling suicidal whenever everyone gets social.  my inner voice monologue is gone  the few times i ve been able to get it back its been almost impossible to keep going for more than a bit before i eventually get back to self loathing and dread.  emotions are now almost non existent  it feels like the emotions i feel are me telling myself what i wanna feel and not how i actually feel. i can t even play games with my friends without looking blank when winning  even if i want to exclaim in joy.  i can t concentrate on topics  ill be speaking and will manage to just phase out mid topic because i don t know what to say next. i have no personality in my speech too  ill barely ever say  umm  or  like   if someone s talking to me i ll have a tendency to reply in short answers that always are the same  hell yea dude   yea   for sure .  i feel like i have constant brain fog and do stupid things like putting milk in the pantry or accidentally throwing away a cup. if someone asks me something i ll have to process it after they ask me  not as they ask me. like i have to repeat what they say in my head before i answer.   i suffer from what i could only describe as derealization depersonalization. whenever i try to push myself out of it it feels like i m about to sob because i feel like i can t grasp onto reality and pull myself back above the surface.  the fear of being left and abandoned started right after my first shroom trip  this has only gotten worse as i tripped more. it didn t help when my friends actually started to ditch me though due to my newfound retardation  the only way i can really describe it   i remember when i tripped on lsd i felt like my brain was pulled above the water  and that i was actually alive for the first time in years. psilocybin has done the complete opposite to me  making me more drawn and out depressed than i ve ever been. i don t want to do more drugs to escape the problem i ve created for myself though  i just wanna feel alive and social again.  be careful with what you eat guys  you don t know if you re just a bad thought process away from having your existence turned inside out.,2021-05-04 20:22:38
1359,hello everyone   i ve been meditating trying to meditate for over 12 years and could never rein in my adhd level inner monologue. it never stopped for more than a few seconds at most and i even started believing that it was not supposed to. but that would make concentration meditation impossible  and we know that it isn t.  anyway  here s the information for all of you  with love    focusing on peripheral vision stops inner monologue   look anywhere  softly. gently focus on what you see in the corners of your eyes. that s it   there s no mention of this apart from in one book i found and like  one old study about hypnosis techniques  but focusing on peripheral vision apparently engages the parasympathetic nervous system  calms you down and stops internal monologue.  i hope this helps many people.,2021-04-19 19:16:53
5211,i m not even sure how or why people turn off their email threading  if you do this the string of email correspondence is deleted every time you reply.   granted there are some inbox view settings that can keep conversation linked emails together but they don t always work or can be messy and awkward.   you are making the assumption that the person on the other end of the conversation remembers every detail of what was said over the previous days and weeks. and if they don t  then they need to find you re precious emails for reference. sure it s doable  but takes time and can be quite frustrating. it will inevitably delay their reply to a time when they can look back at previous emails.   am i the only one who gets annoyed by this   sorry  maybe it s been a tough email day at the office  ,2021-07-21 18:19:23

5843,hey guys  so basically  i have this extremely unsupportive friend  let s call her  a.  i aspire to be a great singer songwriter someday like my idol  taylor swift  and when i shared this information on our group chat along with some of my original songs  everyone was supportive except for her. she completely ignored me. this incident reminded me that she has never been happy for me and always tries to upstage me. like  today i expressed my joy when i got an a   in my maths exam  and instead of being happy for me  she responded with  lol okay  and then started ranting about how she didn t get her desired marks. moreover  lying has become a hobby for her. 7 months back  she told me that her ex cheated on her  and now she s saying that that was a lie and she only did it for affection. a told me that she s been having family problems  so i let it slide  but i ve had enough.  i want to dump her but i really want to avoid conflict. so should i just ignore her forever  or should i confront her and risk being involved in drama ,2021-09-08 11:08:55

9995,so i made a tinder account recently just to see what its like on there. in my bio i added  just for friends  and really most of my convos were with guys flirting w me. i met this guy who is my age and i made a comment about him being attractive and he sort of brushed it off. he never commented on my appearance. all of our convos have been super platonic and we started texting a week ago. we ft ed to confirm our identities lol and the ft call was brief and awkward because we didn t know what to talk about. so i assumed he only sees me as a friend because he never came on to me and genuinely wants to get to know me. then he asked me if i ever wanted to ft again. i asked why bc the first time was a flop and he said he wanted to talk to me again. is this still platonic or am i projecting what i want to happen ,2021-12-25 22:59:47

2881,as a server it s a lot more efficient and benefits both of us if you ask for lots of sauce when first asking  instead of asking for more when i bring it out.   bonus points if you ask for every sauce extra you need in one go.  as so much of the time i bring out requested sauce and then asked in multiple trips to get you something else .  also i don t know who needs to hear this but don t be embarrassed about asking for loads of ketchup mayo etc. we literally don t care if you eat a bucket,2021-05-19 18:05:12
138469,i feel that happiness is an illusion to keep people alive so the world runs.  there is no point to life without happiness.  i used to think happiness was the default setting of humanity. but now i feel that it is sadness and emptiness. because of this  people are constantly trying to fill that void  and that is the  meaning of life .    i feel like i am chasing something unattainable.   i find myself craving bad things to happen to me like life threatening accidents to distract from the misery i create in my own mind.  i crave these moments because it is only then i feel regarded by those who  should  care about me.  i can t judge others for not loving me because i don t even know how to love others.  these are just my thoughts,2021-06-08 00:34:30
157311,i know not all guys are this douche y but had a guy just tell me this during sex   i  didn t even need porn this time    i m pretty sure this was supposed to be a compliment but holy shit. i didn t even know he needed porn. some things are just hurtful. this is not the first time i ve been sort of insulted during sex but it doesn t get any easier. i already feel used by most of these guys and it just keeps getting worse. i already feel so sad inside why do i let this happen. i know it s a small comment but it just upset me so much considering how much i like him. he doesn t like me though and i guess i m okay with it. it s unrealistic. in some of the videos he s sent me you can see women s makeup in the corner too. i think i m just sensitive. being depressed always makes me hypersensitive.,2021-08-14 02:18:40

2503,i recently started to meditate daily and while sticking with 8 12 minutes for each time  yesterday i just layed down and went with no timer. soon i realized that probably around 1 hour passed and i just disappeared along the way. it wasn t falling asleep  that for sure. it was like  falling asleep  while being a passenger of a car. the thoughts and sensations were still there  but it was like my consciousness was disconnected from it  just looking at it. the time also sped up   i can t remember when i stopped counting  but after that moment it just went  poof   40 minutes in what felt like couple of seconds.  was that the state that you are all pursuing ,2021-06-10 10:23:41

6945,  i m 21  i went to her birthday at a club back in june.  it was both of us going clubbing experience for the first time. i have strict overparanoid parents who wouldn t let me go so i snuck out for this    i waited for her to get dressed for over and hour. and her guy friend kept talking to me and it was awkward as hell. i felt a disturbing feeling when i found out she was planning to sleep in the hotel room with that guy  whom she met off a dating app and has only met up with twice.     after a few hours at the club her guy friend had added me on snapchat. i look over to find her crying for some reason  she had a few drinks already     then we went home at like 10pm when we planned to stay till 12 am    on the way home she told me she thinks her guy friend likes me and even joked  you can have him  and all that.      then the next day she keeps texting me  did he add you    me and him are like friends with benefits   i matched with him on all and not you    he likes me. he calls me b  stands for babe   you didnt you ask mee first before adding him  etc  and turns out she was crying and upset all because her guy friend added me on snapchat and gave her a vibe that he liked me.   i wasn t interested at all.     the guy friend told me on snapchat that he liked me and heard i was looking for a mans  i turned him down and said i like him as a friend. next thing you know she tells me to delete him because  hes hers. and they weren t even dating. he said to me himself  wtf  she s not my girlfriend .     a few days later she messages me she doesn t trust him anymore like i had said  because he told her friends boyfriend that her and him slept together in the hotel room. so i told her everything he said to me as well and she blocked him off everything and told me to do as well. i was secretly really annoyed with her behaviour and found it petty. i just wanted to not feel awkward and get along with her friends.  and it was shocking to know she was this kind of person that has friends with benefit    not long ago she sent me an instagram link to the same club. and told me she wanted to go there during new years  and i could chip in with her bestfriend in hotel if i want to come     a few days later i randomly messge her  who else is coming to clubbing with us   and she says to me  ahhhh. i don t know you were coming  and i told her she told me on instagram  then she goes on to say  i didn t invite you. i will ask my best friend and my guy friend what they think.  not to mention because i said i couldn t find the guts to stand up to my mom  she brought up the fact that she had told me that he best friend didn t like me because i m quiet and me and her guy friend sat there as if we weren t there and were unaware of what was going on  which disappointed her and that i need to work on my confidence  because we are both people that type a lot on text  but are quiet in real life. for me it s a sensitive topic i m quiet because of my social anxiety disorder  which i hope goes away.    then i remember she did the exact same thing at my karaoke birthday  sat there quiet  didn t talk to anyone as if she wasn t there and didn t sing.     it upsets me that she considers me her best friend yet i m not even automatically invited to the clubbing plans  we met on social media and met up at dancing lessons  so we re friends that barely see each other in real life but occasionally talk online.,2021-10-09 01:01:56
196392,hi  first of all happy new year    brief bio  23m athlete struggling uni student   little warning it may be all over the place  i m reaching out for the first time and would love if anyone would take the time to read through this    i got diagnosed with adhd         3 years ago   diagnosed with adhd and have been possibly suffering from depression my whole life. i don t want to believe i was born with depression as i believe i fell into a depressive state due to my adhd and lifestyle. my mother suffers from depression which i believe stemmed from her struggles through her childhood and adolescents. i have also had my struggles with maintaining a balanced life and would love any advice or tips   i was always a very sporty and sociable kid  i had a good upbringing with a loving and caring family that has given me every opportunity possible. i m so grateful they have done so as it has helped me excel in many aspects of my life.   i went away to play sport for an international college after completing school. as i arrive i get invited to play in a scratch match  get there... warm up... tear a tendon in my knee and was unable to play for the entirety of the year. i spent countless hours working with physios and specialists throughout my time away with no luck. throughout the year i was told countless times a date that i should be able to return to playing again  each time i would get my hopes up and be let down. i was still giving everything i could to the team i.e going to training  every day  and trips when we played. throughout my time away i became very disconnected from my life back home and even from the people i met in this new city. i started to smoke weed almost daily and started to neglect my studies  my motivation was at an all time low  i did anything and everything to try and enjoy my time but i spiraled down. i was 19 at the time and very naive with my thinking.   i eventually made friends with a group that seemed to actually want to be around me and would always invite me over to their place. i met them through one of my teammates and they brought a lot of fun and good memories into my life. i however started to self sabotage myself by being overly critical and down on my situation. i never let anyone know even my parents about how much i was truly struggling. i started to get really anxious around others and felt isolated  this friend group showed me a side of friendship that i have rarely experienced.   i decided to come home at the end of the year and undergo surgery on my knee. 3 months later i m back playing again and loving it. i however wasn t loving how little i was getting from my friends and started to doubt they even liked me. i can be very over the top at times and have definitely gotten on their nerves but who doesn t. i started to shut off as i wanted to see who would try and reach out  i know now that this was just a silly attempt of trying to get clarity. the problem was right in front of me... it was me and it was that i was comparing my schoolmates who really know me to friends i made whilst i was away.   i got diagnosed with adhd         3 years ago   i have a good group and it s nice to have people around me i just hold a lot of regret about how i acted upon coming home. i fell back into the habit of smoking almost every day as that s what everyone else was doing however the way we smoked didn t sit well with me  it wasn t enjoyable. i picked up cigarettes and have struggled with a nicotine addiction since  from smoking to vaping. the main thing for me during this time was a new friend that my mates made whilst i was away. it felt like a replacement at the time and slowly became it to an extent. i didn t care as i began to like him even if it wasn t reciprocated.   i went through so many doubts and started to beat myself up about never having a gf. i have always gotten a lot of attention from the opposite sex and probably have a bad reputation as a result of impulsive decisions throughout my teens. i never understood how people in the city talk about everything and anything   especially when that person  me  seems to not care  i heard many rumors about myself and was shocked because i m truly a loving and caring person. i often do and say things that i don t mean to impulsively and can be blind to the outcomes and consequences at times. i can easily move on from a situation but often get stuck running through past events or memories in my head. like a short film of all my fuck ups... does this happen to anyone else    i would often talk to girls and had a lot of interest coming from the opposite sex. i would never take myself too seriously and began to think i was wrong for it. so i tried  i started seeing a girl casually and things progressed quickly  we fell deeply in love  i asked her out before a europe trip... big mistake. i stayed loyal and enjoyed my time away with friends which my gf never believed  which i still don t understand as we talked daily and i told her about everything. after a year of  for the most part  a happy relationship things slowly declined. she never trusted me and often made me do things to ease her stress such as unfollowing people on insta  constantly updating her on my whereabouts  and many more. i was unaware that this was bad behavior and just thought it was normal. i never chatted much with my mates about it until the very end  i never did talk about these things much. i was trying to be the best bf for her and was unaware of how neglectful i was becoming of my own life. there was a point were i didn t talk to anyone else but her  i was beginning to obsess over making her happy. it was very hot and cold by the end and became very toxic. i went 6 months without chatting to my mates i started to stop caring about my life and things that i wanted to do needed to do.   we broke up and it killed me  i was torn from the world i had been putting so much effort and time into within seconds. i became very lonely and overdid trying to get back into the swing of things. it was a really hard time. my trust was all over the place as she would often plot me against my friends...  i now see that there s a possibility that i fell into a depressive mindset whilst away overseas and didn t realize what i was going through. i started going through all aspects of my life after getting diagnosed hoping to find answers improvements wherever i could. hence the need for a gf i never needed before. i clung to the idea rather than what was actually in front of me  i did everything i could to keep the company she provided. when that breakup happened i was lost and stuck at a shitty point in my life. starting to regret dating in the first place and a landslide of past memories came sliding through my mind. how i m such a letdown all the nonsense you tell yourself in those moments. i then criticized not only my friends but my family and regret it.   i started taking antidepressants after soldiering on through the hardest time of my life. i was not being healthy and everyone could see but i still struggle with my body and self image. they have helped a lot but i m still struggling immensely with managing myself  i let people down with slow replies or dumb messages that had no meaning highly emotional nonsense. can anyone help with a daily routine      amp  x200b   i know this is a lot but please feel free to leave any comments or advice below       amp  x200b   cheers xx,2022-01-03 07:19:59

4954,today i turned 23 and it s been the worst birthday ever  i woke up very depressed after planning to kill myself the night before and attempted the same thing again today  i had an anxiety attack as i started to feel faint which prevented me from going through with it. i had 2 cards from family members and not a single person said happy birthday to me on social media  besides one who had to be reminded . no birthday has ever been good for me  but this one certainly takes the cake. are there any fellow redditors who feel my pain and are just as lonely as me   ,2020-02-16 14:15:38
4204,when meditating i seem to almost always be  or be looking at a blue man non distinct with no hair  or clothes  he sometimes has a ring over his shoulders with colored lights  sometimes he we are sitting in a matrix of lines in the shape of a orb. sometimes with his third eye exposed  sometimes with his back turned  sometimes with his back turned and the back of his head has a giant eye that opens. theses are reasonably consistent visualizations  so i was wondering if anyone may have some insight ,2021-09-12 10:57:56

5651,the brain is very intent on task  and if a task is unfinished our brain likes to go back to it. one of the reasons song lyrics get stuck in our head and learning the lyrics can help get them out. when you are struggling with thinking at night  telling yourself that you ll think about it tomorrow will basically  finish the task  for your brain. also on another note  taking time to process things during the day can help with overthinking at night.,2021-08-01 03:25:30

7750,so i m not sure if i m overthinking this but i have a friend that i ve known since grade 4  that was in a different country . anyway  we have stayed friends throughout these years  sometimes close and sometimes just the happy birthday types . however things changed when i got engaged in 2020. i had posted my picture on instagram with my fianc  and she took a screenshot and made it her story to wish us  nice gesture on her part . i m not the type to repost a story to thank a person for their wishes  as some people do  and do i didn t do that. she asked me why i didn t and i told her. i asked if she wanted me to and she said it didn t matter and that i should do what i want so i didn t make it my story. anyway  things have changed since then. if i message her she takes days to reply. i ve given her the benefit of the doubt assuming were adults and busy. however  maybe she just doesn t want to talk to me anymore. recently it was her birthday and we have a group chat where our mutual friends wished her but i wanted to personally wish her  too possibly reconnect  so i messaged her individually and it has been 5 days since she s been online but hasn t responded to my message. she replied to the group chat thanking the others on the same day. i m not sure if i should just stop trying to save this friendship or if i m overthinking this,2021-10-28 23:50:08

100893,in february of 2020 my life started falling apart. it was getting towards the end of my almost 3 year relationship. i was 19 i m 20 now  at the time and had just graduated highschool the year prior. at first everything was great  we had our own place together  pets  and worked at the same place. we loved each other so much. it was toxicity that ended our relationship i shouldn t have acted how i did but the same went for her i hate that old person i used to be. in february my grandfather passed away i became very depressed along with having to deal with this toxic relationship yet i needed her in my life. it made no sense there were so many times where i just wanted to be alone but i still wanted her in my life i needed her so much. she was all i had. i have no friends. she was my friend. due to me being depressed and basically i had changed my whole mood i was just so upset. in april of 2020 my girlfriend and i broke up. i had no idea what to do. i lost the only person i needed. i lost my moon. i lost part of me. i moved into my uncles house after we broke up. a few months of agonizing nights of endless crying went by and my uncle and i had to be evicted that was in october 2020. i moved into my aunts house that is a 2 bedroom house and currently has 6 people and 6 animals living here. i m very grateful she s letting me stay her but i m going mentally insane everyday here. my family is incredibly toxic to eachother and i have no privacy at all no car to go anywhere  no license nothing. i sleep on a cot in the basement next to my grandma. i work a minimum wage restaurant job and i m in 2500 in debt and i have no idea what to do. it hasn t got better it s got so much more worse than i could have ever imagined. i have absolutely no one to talk to about anything no ones here for me i gave all my time to my ex and didn t have time for friends or anything. i drown my sorrows in alcohol and weed and any drug worth taking. what do i do. i think about suicide every day but i can t go to anyone or a therapist due to no insurance or money. my anxiety is a whole other story. i m sorry for the mixed up post i m drunk and just wanted to vent if you read this thanks maybe we could talk or something  ,2021-01-14 00:54:47

1206,rant ahead    i ve had friends who started ignoring my messages because i apparently missed responding to some of their messages before. but isn t that completely understandable  if i m busy or preoccupied  i could respond late or even miss responding. not everyone responds to all of my messages either  but i don t go blocking them because of that.   on the flip side  i had this friend start ignoring me because i apparently asked too many questions about her life. is it wrong of me to ask my friends how they re doing  and want to know what s going on in their life  i wouldn t ask if i didn t care. how does that become an offensive thing    they expect me to answer their questions  but get offended if i expect the same  wut    someone explain to me why this keeps happening to me.. is it better if i stop reaching out to old friends  and just let them slowly become strangers..  ,2021-04-05 17:21:51

82897,most of my life i ve been a fake person. i ve faked many emotions  even love. i ve faked my way through friendships  jobs and interests.  i ve faked who i was and what i wanted out of life.   does that make me a bad person  perhaps  but i know why i was that fake person. it s because that s who i genuinely wanted to be and how i genuinely wanted to feel. i wanted to be able to love  i wanted to be able to be a good friend  which i know i was for a time.  i tried with every ounce of my stale heart to be that person i was not. i did everything i was supposed to do and in the end it all fell apart.   i wish i could go back in time and try again  but i doubt that would help. i know it would probably all end the same no matter what i tried.   i m unbelievably envious of those who are able to feel those emotions and build their lives with out the effort of battling mental illness as well.   so yes  i am a fake person and i absolutely hate myself for it. but i know if i was able to feel like i m supposed to be able to  i wouldn t have had to be fake.   thank you for reading. take care.,2020-11-22 21:32:06

1898,if they find someone susceptible to this manipulation  they will often use this person as a  source  for getting this type of validation  which is very energy draining for the other person. the reason for it being draining is because basically you get pushed to believe that it s your responsibility for holding up their self image.   in the long run this can be detrimental for your mental health. the reason for you being targeted by this is often because of some guilt issues you have  making yourself believe that you  can help the person     you don t want to be a bad friend    etc.   good friends take responsibility for their own emotions and don t expect others to make them feel better about themselves. don t let other people be parasites on your life energy.,2021-04-23 06:42:16

73333, what are everyone s thoughts on and experiences with taking psychedelics to help with depression   i was thinking about taking 3 5 grams of mushrooms  or maybe dmt  in a safe  controlled environment with a close friend as a trip sitter  and possibly having some music  spiritual  inspiring  relaxing  for the last hour or 2  the comedown. i m not expecting everything to be fine afterwards  like a magic pill that makes everything go away and all of a sudden i m walking on sunshine everything and doing exactly what i need to do and. i m just looking for a little perspective on my life  my problems  my existence as a whole. if i don t notice any positive effects within the next 3 4 months i ll never do them again  but if i do  maybe i ll trip again around every 3 4 months or once a year or so.  that sound like a decent enough idea ,2020-10-19 01:14:53

4220,i used to have a hard time with remembering to take my meds    if i already took them  and these four steps helped a ton  so i figured i would share the wisdom    1  set a phone alarm to the time you need to take it and also to everyday the days of the week. i also set an alarm 20 minutes later as a second reminder. so  say  i need to take them at 5 40pm everyday. i set one for 5 40pm  then another for 6pm.   2  once you ve taken it  turn the bottle box upside down so you know you took it by looking at the position it is set on.   3  after taking the medication and possibly turning the bottle box upside down  say  i took my meds  out loud. i usually say it three times  but just one might do the trick.   4  if i know i m having a particularly difficult day with remembering if i took my meds  i ll also scribble a flower on the back of my hand with pen once i take it  serves as a visual reminder ,2021-06-25 20:16:23
1690, this guy complied 72 of them in one place.  https   www.fsi language courses.org fsi language courses    i ve yet to find free language learning resources as good as these  duolingo and other apps are good supplements but bad as a core learning resource  . they re aimed at people who need to learn a language fast and well  diplomats  so you get very dense straight to the point and very well structured lessons.  the big turnoff is the esthetic aspect  the text is in typewriter font with very few to no images at all and the audio is sort of monotonous but you get used to it  the courses are also decades old but that shouldn t matter for an entry level course . i personally like the administrative almost comically serious vibe the texts and audios give off.,2021-04-17 11:38:00

111969,how do you do it  what keeps you moving forward     i m 27 and going to be 30 in a few years and i have not accomplished anything. i keep telling myself others have it worse than me and i have no reason to complain. i ve been struggling with this for over 10 years and it feels like it only gets worse every time. sure there are some ups  but it feels like the downs are much worse every time. i constantly find myself lost  lonely  sad  confused  and angry.   everyone  i thought i can trust or considered a close friend has either disappeared or betrayed me. i keep pushing forward in hopes that tomorrow will get better. if i just push an extra year maybe it ll be all better  but it doesn t. i think about my family and that s what keeps me going. i know what it s like to have a family member commit suicide and the toll it sends throughout the family.   these aren t the full extent of my thoughts and what i ve been through  but i feel like it would be too much to put on here.   some helpful advice would be nice to read.   thank you for reading    d,2021-02-21 18:44:46

77204,this is my first post here. i recently started therapy and am thinking about talking to a doctor for help. i was trying to write out what i felt like as an exercise to just get it out of my head and this is what i got    i am quicksand filled with beautiful things. things to be proud of and things to show off. things that are decaying and turning to rot inside me. i feel them.   i place achievements on my surface regularly and speak about them with a polite humility. they rest on this pillar of sand feeding my desperation to be told i m doing right and am an example to my peers. i thrive. tell me how wonderful it is. tell me what a beautiful thing i have  what an achievement  what a skill. please don t notice it is sinking into me. don t acknowledge it. i will devour myself too  in time. let it happen quietly. please.  look at this. before it s fibers start to decompose and turn to ash  don t you think it s grand  i did that. i m doing that. i will do that. be proud in case i make it happen. don t look while it sinks. please. forget when it s gone. remember you were proud  but forget why. don t look for it. it s gone anyway. but tell me it was good. it was pretty. rotten  putrid  sour now  but it was pretty the way you saw it. that s what matters. remember that. i feel it dying just like all the others. please forget.  i will be a vet  a writer  an accountant  an analyst  a data scientist  a programmer  a failure  a pit. the last is constant. but tell me i m not. i ll believe it  for a time. i ll feel good and show you something to point at and praise. but did i really do it  will i do it  have i  would i  can i  failure. actor. manipulator. liar. sink hole.  the rot is compost inside me. just enough to sustain me until there is something new to put on my surface. it will be beautiful. it too will sink.,2020-11-03 17:23:17

144130,hello   in the past when i used to smoke 15 20 cigarettes a day  while being a lustral  antidepressant  user  25 50mg   i used to get that juicy dopamine feeling  being excited about doing something new  discovering new stuff and getting engaged in something that i love regardless of its nature.  since the beginning of 2017 when i completely quit smoking and stopped lustral  sharp tapered   and after struggling for a complete year to live a  clean  life and integrating healthy habits and sport  i can tell that i didn t succeed in having that dopamine feeling till now  and i really don t know if i ll be able to live it again.  wish to hear experience of others going through this.  thanks,2021-06-28 12:50:12

56481,the only thing that is holding me back are my parents  they ve put so much effort on me  it would be so selfish of my part if i did it.   i attempted suicide last year  but at that moment something happened that made me so desperate i had no other option  i drank half a bottle of vodka and swallowed all my benzos hoping i would fall into cardiac arrest or respiratory failure  but i only blacked out for a whole day.   sometimes i wish i had swallowed more pills and drank the full bottle. sometimes i wish another event like the one that triggered my suicide attempt happened.  i m in my early 30 s and nothing is getting better  it is getting worst. i have nobody but my nearest family members. i live a life of despair and loneliness. i don t trust anyone. everyone is extremely evil and selfish towards me. i only feel rejection and hatred. i m so tired all day... i want it to end.,2020-08-14 22:30:31
23750,i have been depressive for more than two years. at first when my friends found out how serious it was  they were very supportive. when i attempted suicide  they came to visit me at the hospital. they ve kept being amazing friends and kept supporting me a lot  but it s been years and i haven t improved one bit. it s exhausting them   i ve used them as a crutch.  they can t relate to me  and i can t relate to them anymore. i can t have fun with them  i can t really laugh with them. i ve changed  i m not the person they became friends with in the first place. now they re slowly leaving me  and i honestly don t blame them one bit. i ve been dragging them down for too long  they have their own lives to live. it s not their responsibility to help me  and i m not even sure i can be helped. i love them and i bid them farewell  but now i don t know what i have to keep me alive.  besides lack of courage   have you guys managed to keep your friends through it all ,2020-04-21 12:15:27
40337,my whole life  i had social anxiety  along with multiple other problems making me pretty much completely incapable of being good with people  mutism  stuttering  or even being alone  ocd  ticks  general anxiety . it was rough getting through middle school  but ok. high school was a whole different story  constantly feeling like the lowest of the low  with no one there for me   no friends  and family split apart. and constantly being nervous to be put in stressful situations for me  like presentations. feeling like i m wasting my life. only a few things made me feel like i belonged somewhere  for short periods of time  then back to hell. i m a senior now  and the quarantine destroyed my last chance of making friends or something good like that  which i was working toward harder than you could imagine. now everyone is unquarantining  hanging out with friends again. everyone but me. i have to sit on the sidelines in pain like every other summer has been  only this one i was counting on being the one good. it has convinced me i was meant to fail  and always will. college will be quarantined  and even if it wasn t  i know i wouldn t amount to anything  and it would be even worse then because it costs money. i might have given it a try  if not for this summer in the way  where i would have to be tourtured feeling left out  especially at graduation in july reminding me of everything and being the only letdown to my family there. after college  i would have to get an apartment on my own  and just sit in solitary confinement until i die. better just to end it now to not be a burden any longer...,2020-06-17 16:36:08
6429,15 m   i really like this girl in my class i talk to her every day and she s very fun to talk to. either way i started catching feelings for her  but was wondering how can i tell if she s catching feelings for me  just incase so i can make a move .   she has 1 other friend not including me   i m pretty sure she talks to me the most   we even walk to the bus together  she gave me her snapchat  and i didn t even ask for it. i was just scrolling through she grabbed my phone and added herself without me doing anything asking.  she s a extremely nice and adorable person and very fun to talk to  and she seems to be enjoying my company.  not really sure what the signs of people having crushes on others are besides them strating at you from time to time but that s it.   any other signs to help me find out if she has mutual feelings ,2021-09-24 23:53:58

65089,i m not qualified for any job because i lack the experience  education  and certifications for most. no one wants to hire me.  i wouldn t hire me either. i will have to resort to extensively embellishment of my resume and experience.  i wish i had studied social work. i wish i had at least dropped out when i felt i needed to  instead of listening to my parents and staying in a dead end major.  i think back to the decisions i made and feel deep shame and heavy regret. i wasted several years doing nothing useful. i wish i hadn t followed what was  expected  of me. i wish i had been mature  planned ahead  and made better choices.  i fell behind others my age because i am not mature like them. i am stupid and mediocre and childish. i am pathetic  weak  cowardly and small.  going back to school now will take years. in the end  i will not have much of a life to behold. i don t want to live at all.  i don t speak about this to anyone because i am just told  well you re responsible for what happened  or  you re young  or  you re too negative  or  your resume has problems  yeah  that must be it .  i feel the crushing weight of self hatred  i have been unemployed for years now  i have no social life or support  i loathe my essence. i will  for the rest of my life  pay dearly for the poor choices i made at 18.  my chest feels tight  my head aches from clenching my jaw unconsciously  i am tired of being me and being alive. i hate living  i am alone  worthless  useless and i am not someone worth being.,2020-09-16 20:35:35

88941,does anyone else just repeatedly self sabotage    eating like shit  not studying  missing appointments  pushing people away  being an asshole  that kind of stuff.   the thing is  is that i make all these decisions consciously. i m fully aware that i m going to regret what i m doing  but in the heat of the moment i just don t care. these self destructive thoughts just take a hold of me and i just start escalating shit.  it s like i don t want to improve and that any ups should be met with downs. feeling like shit and being miserable feels normal to me. i m so complacent in my current situation that anything positive just feels abnormal  so i self sabotage.  when people think about self harm the first thing that springs to mind is physical self harm like cutting yourself  but i feel like self sabotage is a much more insidious way of self harm because of how subtle it is.  you can t see the blood  you can t see the scars it s almost invisible. i just wish more people would pay attention this type of self harm.  i m so tired i wish i was normal  apologies if i made some grammar mistakes english is not my first language.,2020-12-10 12:07:12

1998,recently i ve been using my heart instead of my mind to look at things. i am able to drop my awareness from my mind and allow it to flow into my heart. what i discovered is that i have more space to process the intruding thoughts that my mind usually magnifies. when i drop awareness down to my heart i become curious about the experience i am having in the present moment.   it is quite difficult for awareness to remain in the heart but that s only because of years and years of conditioning and thinking that awareness is only in the mind.   when i drop down into the heart  nothing seems to matter except this present moment. it s true and it s what s real. my problem was that i was always focusing on what is false. when doubt comes into play and you start questioning yourself   where do thoughts of doubt even come from  what s it like to experience the feeling of doubt  it s strange really.,2021-05-16 16:00:45
169522,my depression first started a couple of years ago. it was bad at first  but i gradually got used to living with it and pretty much became a high functioning depressed person. i did well in my college courses and managed to maintain an ok social life. now  after three years  i can feel it all beginning to fall apart. i am really unmotivated to do my schoolwork  all i want to do is play videogames all day  i can t stop thinking about my future  stressful and uncertain  and my past failures in life. pretty much all of my friends are thriving in one way or another while i sit here with no girlfriend  an uncertain future  and some new health problems. the only thing that keeps my going at this point is my family  whom i love and cannot bear to hurt  but it s getting harder and harder every day. i can feel the leather belt in my dresser whispering my name louder and louder every day...,2021-09-27 13:44:58

8897,i know it s not ideally wrong  but is it a good idea to ask someone if they care  one of my  friends   not sure if they really are a  friend  and that s why i m writing this   i feel is pretty dry. i m not sure if this is due to the fact that they re antisocial. i m the one who initiates the majority of the conversations  and i don t feel as tho they really care. i m terrible when it comes to social skills  so i m unsure. i m considering writing something along the lines of  you good  i feel as tho you don t really seem to care   the issue is  i feel as tho i d get a negative reaction either way if they do care or not  how should i go about this ,2021-11-26 18:04:40
15960,so basically  i ve seen this therapist twice now. first time  i was severely depressed for about 2 weeks after seeing her. telling her about my problems  which mainly revolve around my failed relationship  just brought back so many memories.   but i thought i d still give her a second shot. i don t know what i am gaining  because i am still the same level of depressed. i am trying to keep myself busy  trying to find anything to do. but being unemployed  now coronavirus spreading around  no one is willing to hire  none of my friends are leaving their houses  fair enough   having seen photos of my ex that i took on a trip she and i went on end of 2018.... i am suffocating.   i hate what happened between her and i. it fucking kills me everyday to remember her. yet  i doubt she thinks about me. i want to reach out to her and ask her how her family  french  are doing.. mainly her mum and dad  they fit the category of being at risk.   fml  when i thought my life was looking up... it all came crashing fucking down. i peaked. i found the entrance ticket from our first date. i wonder if she keeps hers...,2020-03-23 09:21:52

37051,i first wanted to thank everyone in this community. before i found this subreddit i didn t realize how many people were at the same point i was and i m not alone.  but i just graduated high school  what kickstarted my depression  and now find no point to life. i feel like the only thing we contribute to this world is carbon emissions at the end of the day. that all humans do on this planet is destroy it. i feel like there is no meaning to life  but suicide is selfish. i feel like i m the dumbest person in the world even though i m going to a top 30 college next year. i always joke about being depressed to my friends but they don t know that i m actually depressed and have been for the past 3 years. i have extreme trust issues so i can never get myself to talk about it with anyone. i just feel like i m a waste of resources for our planet. thanks for listening to my ramble,2020-06-06 01:27:09
10352,so for the first time last year  i got psychiatric help that i desperately needed  and was prescribed some anti depressants. i m a guy who is sentimental  and likes to have all my things be more personal  so i was looking for a pillcase i liked  but also had seven slots for seven days. i feared i d forget to take my meds  or even take two doses by mistake  if i didn t have that organization. i looked everywhere  but for the life of me i couldn t find a pillcase with a design i liked  while also having the seven slots.  i was a little upset  and i told my friend my struggle. i woke up the next day to find out she d spent over an hour searching the internet  and found me the perfect pill case  i genuinely cried  as it was the sweetest thing anyone had ever done for me  and i made sure she knew how much it meant to me. she seemed surprised by how much i cared about her help  and i told her it was one of the most thoughtful things anyone has ever done for me.  tl dr  needed the perfect pillcase  and my friend spent over an hour to find me one  ,2022-01-03 19:51:04
8327,even if you think you ll stay loyal to a certain brand for the rest of your life  don t use a service that only works for that brand. give yourself as many options as you can.  future you will thank you   for example  if you want to buy an e book  buy it through amazon kindle instead of apple books. you may think that you will always stick with apple products  but maybe  later in life  you decide to buy a kindle reader or switch to android. if you want to reread some of your favorite books  the kindle app will work on all devices whereas the apple app will only work on apple products.  if you are trying to choose between apple music and spotify  go with spotify since it can work on more products. for example  you can listen to spotify on garmin smartwatches but not apple music.  apple is trying to prevent garmin from competing with apple watch by limiting where one can listen to music ,2021-10-15 14:05:35

68863,this is going to be a mindless rant  so i do not care if you read or not.  i am 16  a junior in high school  yet i am living unlike my peers. all of my classmates are charismatic and extroverted  yet i am the contrary. i cannot force myself to put my own self in the public eye  as i do not believe i have the personality or face for that.   i am ugly to the bone. im fat  and have a horrid personality. im cynical  sarcastic and negative. i believe i am going to die alone. in my 16 years of living  i have not yet had a girlfriend  or even anyone that is romantically interested in me. i cannot blame them  as i wouldn t be interested in myself either. i am never going to have the same experiences other teenagers will. i am going to spend these years alone  and i am going to regret every moment of it. yet i cannot find the will or determination or motivation to do anything about my current situation. i am in a spiral of self hate  and i have no motive to leave. i hate myself to the core  as i wish to change but i will not. i always return to what i know  to what is comfortable. i shall never leave my comfort zone and i will never be happy. no one is going to find me attractive enough to want a romantically charged relationship with myself. these are the facts  and i will have to bear them for the rest of my dreadful life.,2020-10-02 00:38:09

194123,i feel that i have been suffering minor depression the last 1.5 years or so but ig just shrugged it off because i wanted too be  manly  about my feelings but it has gotten too the point where it effects my work  my social side and my hope for the future.   the past 6 months or so felt like some of the best of my life and i felt my depression might of even left but ive had a real down point in life which has taken a massive mental hit on me  had a fairly traumatic vehcle accident  my gf left me for no distinct reason  had multiple family members pass. recently with parental advice i saw a doctor about my mental heath for the first time and was the first time i was diagnosed with depression.   i was never the person too talk about my feelings and issues too friends and family because i was scared of what they would think  my life feels empty. i no longer find the joy in my past hobbies  i try too go out and hang with friends as much as i can but always feel like i just want too be alone all the time. im sick of feeling like i have too hide my feelings and depression from people because of how they woukd react.  i can t work properly  my short time memory has been affected too the point where alot of the time i cant hold a proper conversation with anyone. my brain just feels so foggy and clouded with negative thoughts  the feeling of crying yourself too sleep and feeling like a burden 24 7 too everyone is really hard on me. self harm has been on my mind many times but is never something that i have  or hopefully never will  go through with. i m sick of hiding behind the smile  i just need the right approach too get the help i need.   thankyou for reading,2021-12-25 09:30:40
24368,the human brain is by far the most complex and intricate organ in the body. apart from regulating our most basic biological functions  the brain is also the seat of consciousness. when something is not right  either due to an irregularity in neurochemical signaling or because of structural deficits caused by either injury or old age  this can often affect how we experience consciousness and how we perceive the world around us.  the brain is made up of billions of neurons that communicate with one another through electrical impulses  via nerve fibers known as axons  or by sending neurochemical signals to one another via synapses. new connections are constantly being made  and old  no longer useful connections are being pared throughout each individual s life  which means the precise number of synaptic connections is always in a state of flux though at any given time there may be upwards of  100 trillion  https   www.discovermagazine.com health numbers the nervous system from 268 mph signals to trillions of synapses  of these connections in an adult brain.   equally important  the number of neurons in the brain is constantly changing. though there is still some debate on the matter  it appears that  new neurons  https   www.scientificamerican.com article the adult brain does grow new neurons after all study says   are constantly being formed  via a process called neurogenesis  in certain parts of the brain. meanwhile  it has been established that degrative enzymes lead to the controlled death  apoptosis  of other neurons. the proteins responsible for regulating these processes of cell birth and cell death in the brain are known as neurotrophic factors  or neurotrophins   one of which is brain derived neurotrophic factor  bdnf .    what is bdnf     neurotrophic factors are produced in the brain and the  gut  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pmc articles pmc4697050   in limited quantities from the time we are in the womb until the time we pass away. when a neuron obtains an adequate amount of these proteins during development  it survives  while neurons that do not receive enough do not survive. as these proteins are not abundant  neurons must constantly compete for them during development and even into old age.  researchers have discovered numerous neurotrophins  including nerve growth factor  ngf   neurotrophic factor 3  nt 3   neurotrophic factor 4 5  nt 4 5   as well as bdnf. bdnf is regarded as the most active neurotrophin  and it is also extremely important to  energy homeostasis  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pmc articles pmc4697050   and neuronal plasticity  which is crucial to learning and memory. decreased levels of bdnf have been associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinson s disease  alzheimer s disease  multiple sclerosis  and huntington s disease. reduced bdnf levels may also be associated with  type 2 diabetes  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pmc articles pmc4697050  .  conversely  higher levels of the protein are associated with improved cognitive functioning   mental health  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pubmed 24524285   and short  and long term memory. while it is not clear at this time if increasing bdnf levels can reverse or prevent neurodegenerative conditions  normal levels of bdnf are typically associated with better cognitive performances and overall brain function in individuals with the conditions noted above.    can i increase my bdnf levels     the short answer is yes. research has found that several factors  particularly  obesity  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pubmed 24524285   may influence bdnf levels obese individuals have lower bdnf levels while non obese individuals have higher bdnf levels. additionally  research indicates that other lifestyle changes  explored below  may positively impact bdnf levels.    rigorous exercise    rigorous exercise has been shown to increase bdnf levels. a  study  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pubmed 21722657  published in 2011 found that three weeks of high intensity cycling and five weeks of aerobic exercise improved cognitive functioning and increased levels of bdnf. yet another  study  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pubmed 21282661  found that bdnf levels increased with aerobic exercise and that this corresponded with an increase in hippocampal volume by 2 percent.  the hippocampus plays a major role in the creation and storage of memories and tends to decrease in volume with age.   on top of helping to combat obesity and increase bdnf  thereby improving overall brain function  these studies suggest that exercise can be especially beneficial to memory.    dietary changes    the typical american diet is high in calories and often contains excessive saturated fats and processed sugars. additionally  many individuals tend to eat dinner fairly late at night. taken in conjunction  such dietary habits can lead to obesity  which  as noted above  can negatively impact bdnf levels and  overall cognitive health  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pubmed 15741046 . these  habits  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pubmed 16011467  can also independently lead to reduced bdnf levels.  several studies have found that intermittent fasting and caloric restriction is associated with  increased bdnf  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pubmed 16011467  levels. additionally  diets that are high in processed sugars and saturated fats can affect neurotrophin levels  including bdnf levels  which in turn can lead to a  reduction  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pubmed 12088740  in hippocampal volume and neuroplasticity. to avoid these detrimental effects  individuals should stay away from processed sugars and saturated fats  and switch to a diet that is based largely on leafy vegetables  fruits  lean proteins  and whole grains.    drugs and supplements    in addition to making dietary changes  some supplements have been shown to increase bdnf levels. they include      curcumin  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pubmed 24914461   which is found in turmeric    green tea  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pubmed 24508265     omega 3 fatty acids  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pubmed 15672635   which are found in fish  flaxseed  and fish oil    resveratrol  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pubmed 21221775   which is found in grapes  and wine   dark chocolate  pistachios  blueberries  and peanuts.  additionally  data suggests that some drugs may increase bdnf levels though this is not an accepted indication for any of these drugs. these include  ampakines  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pmc articles pmc2746455     cystamine  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pubmed 16604191    nootropic drugs  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pubmed 20095391   and  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pubmed 20095391   ssris . more importantly  they should only be taken if prescribed by a medical professional.    sunlight    while it is well known that the winter months can oftentimes affect one s mood  the precise neurobiological mechanism behind this change is not entirely known. one possible mechanism could be decreased levels of bdnf  which is correlated positively with levels of vitamin d  a vitamin our skin makes from cholesterol when it is exposed to sunlight. in other words  more sunlight appears to lead to increases in bdnf levels.  a dutch  study  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pmc articles pmc3487856   involving 2 851 participants found significant fluctuations in serum bdnf concentrations throughout the year. notably higher concentrations were found in the spring summer months and lower concentrations were found in the autumn winter months. the study suggests that vitamin d could play a role in the regulation of this protein.    be social    social engagement appears to also affect bdnf levels  particularly in developing brains. while it has been well documented that a stimulating and welcoming social environment early in life produces positive behavioral results later in life  a roman study from 2006 found that these benefits can be observed on the neurochemical level. the  study  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pubmed 16533499  discovered that mice raised in a communal nest had significantly increased neurotrophin levels in several brain areas  particularly the hippocampus and hypothalamus  even later in life. it seems reasonable to assume that a similar phenomenon would be observable in humans  though it is unclear if adults can experience similar benefits from being in a stimulating social environment.  ultimately  the best way to increase bdnf levels is to adopt a healthier overall lifestyle that can also contribute positively to one s mental health and cardiovascular health  while also reducing one s level of body fat. these changes include exercising  being social  getting outside  and eating a diet that is rich in nutrient dense foods and devoid of processed sugars and saturated fats,2020-04-23 14:02:16
123463,a friend of mine is hiding something that is killing her. i ve been trying to tell her that she can tell me what it is  that im always here to listen and help  but i dont want to force her to tell me something that she hasn t told a single other person. but i really need to help her  as she says  that if she tells it to me  she will start crying. im scared of what it is  but she needs to get that weight off her somehow  she cant keep an incident in her and not talk about it. at least as far as i know  when you start talking about it  it gets better. so please someone give me some advice of how should i handle this situation  and help her with the pain. i know that it may be better if i talk about it to her in person  not through a call  and i want her to gain the confidence and power to let that pain out somehow. thank you,2021-04-18 19:54:02
1019,i ve gotten close with 3 people  all guys  this school semester and we re all in this social club. new members were recently accepted and i m scared and jealous that they won t hang out with me as much anymore. i m the only girl  and i think i m jealous that the attention won t be on me as much  but i don t want to feel this way. why do i feel so insecure about our friendship  why am i such an attention whore   i think it s b c i ve experienced having it and now i don t want to let go and share. the thing is i might have feelings for one ... or two of them. omg i m a terrible person. wtf is wrong with me. do i actually like them or just the attention  but honestly  if you re interested in more than 1 person how do you know which person you like more and the most ,2021-03-30 00:06:43
121799,i ve come about the realization that  just like you  i m a speck. i don t get out often  but when i do  i see everyone going about their business. they ve tangled in their own  complicated lives. every individual   i m envious at that. sure  sure  you would say that i  also  apply to that same criteria   i do have my own life as well  but frankly  i feel like a wee little kiddo. i m 13  soon to be 14. i ve got no responsibility to look after  and that s only because i can t find decent job opportunities  someone of my age is universally unreliable  silly and foolish. as much as i try to transcend the caliber that society expects of me  i suppose it s really a futile effort. there s something strange about me  i strive to feel inferior. i made some plan to take myself to college  when i get older  solely for the experience. i want to look around  knowing that everyone is here with legitimate ambitions and goals  for a successful life. i would use so much money so comfortably  because i ve got a solid plan to take my life just before or as i hit 30. i m sure it ll stick.,2021-04-09 00:04:58
22191,every time when i ask myself  why are you depressed   my answer is always i dont know or a spiral of self hate and things not working out  which is normal  its part of life. i dont know  i m just weak and i m a coward. do i even know what depression is  what it means to be depressed  i dont know. why do i find it so difficult to effectively convey my feelings to myself nevermind to anyone else. i dont know. i just don t know anymore. my life is fine. i just don t know why i m like this. i dont understand myself and i wish i did  but unfortunately  a guide book for my mind doesn t exist. and it s like i like being depressed  its almost as in i put myself in this mindset intentionally  which sounds quite crazy and sadistic. i like the pain  i like feeling worthless and a failure. but then  i dont like feeling like this and just want to be okay again  normal i guess. ah i dont know. whenever i feel like this  i just tell myself to  firm it and keep moving   it s the only thing i can do. but  i dont even know how long i can firm it until i m at a point of no return. i dont know.,2020-04-15 11:42:13

364,basically any section of water line you have that is exposed to to the open air  that is below freezing  and has no flow will freeze within minutes. especially if sub freezing zero temp air is blowing around them.    open up your faucet about a half a turn. just enough to get a pencil size stream. yes it will raise your bill a bit but it will be nothing compared to a 3 4  line freezing or bursting.    invest in foam insulators  think ones that look like pool noodles. even they will work.    if you have a line freeze try pouring hot water on it to get it thawed. you can get snow and if you have power or if power is out and you still have gas heat it til it s hot  not boiling. boiling will cause pipes to stretch and that won t be good.    seal off any way the cold air can get to it. even just a cardboard can keep a line from freezing.   always remove any  and i cannot stress this enough  any water hoses connected to outside faucets  the water will freeze in the water hose which will begin to move down the faucet to your lines freezing and bursting    tips to be prepared for next time   if you haven t yet  invest in something called heat tape. it is a band that you wrap around a pipe and it plugs into a standard outlet  then cover with foam pipe insulation.   if you re afraid you will lose power water  fill all tubs sinks with water. it will be good for a while.,2021-02-17 19:28:17
3090,basically the title. similar to how cornstarch is used in cooking to remove excess moisture  to thicken sauces gravy   it can be used to remove excess moisture grease in your hair. i have pretty greasy hair but this has been a game changer for me  just rub a little bit into your hair and massage it into your scalp and it should look noticeably drier and thicker. for reference  i have blonde hair. if you have darker hair i have heard you can mix in some cocoa powder just so the powder better matches your hair color. ultimately your mileage may vary with this but i wanted to let everyone know  hope it works out for anyone who decides to try it out   ,2021-05-25 10:56:27
2060,while traveling to another country to start medical school  i was listening to a song i d never heard by k. flay  and she offered a unique perspective on fear and growth that really stuck out to me. at one point in the song she writes  the only thing to fear is never being scared . i found this to be an interesting contrast to the famous roosevelt quote that the only thing to fear is fear itself. i find this perspective on fear to be a lot healthier because when we are afraid is when we are presented with out greatest opportunity for growth. pushing ourselves out of our comfort zone is necessary for us to grow as individuals  and we don t have to act like we aren t afraid either. to be scared is to be human.,2021-05-19 23:40:20
132490,i m leaving high school soon. we both go to different colleges  but there is a chance we might end up in the same college. the problem is  i don t see him as a friend. friends trust each other and friendships change depending on a current situation. i ve been feeling down lately and my friend doesn t seem to understand. he doesn t want to understand my feelings  my problems  he thinks they are not valid. i have self diagnosed myself with moderate depression and telling him that he will not be talking to the same friend he was talking to in the past might hurt him to the point he might end our friendship. i don t want to feel this way  but it s so hard not to when you don t receive any support from someone you ve been a friend with for a long time.the magic might have sizzled away  but i m sure he still sees me as a friend. i do not  but i still wish to be his friend. but i can t stay fake forever. i m hurting myself a lot. we have agreed to call in an hour  but i feel so miserable. what do i do ,2021-05-18 07:41:05

5283,meditation can put your mind in a state of immense clarity which then can see things as they are. to achieve such a tranquil state you need to dissolve all your delusions and harmfull values. i would like to share my thoughts on this matter for i find that many struggle with this.  mamy struggle because they are desperate to hold on to something  and when that something is lost they must replace it. people cannot accept reality human nature for what it really is  they cannot accept simplicity so they create new intricate delusions to rationalize and identify themselves over.   rationalization is just a tool and does not have an intrinsict end goal  it will never be satisfactory. it is entirely impossible to arrive at a construction that does not base itself on impossible or unfounded logic  but i won t go into this matter.  i see a lot of people attaching their egos quite strongly to their meditative practices. not only that  they also construct intricate ideas surrounding their spirituality. explore and understand why you are so desperate to have these ideas  where does this come from  in seeing the true nature of yourself desperation arrizes which manifests in weird constructions of the mind to obfoscate the simple things that can be observed.  do not needlessly rationalize  invent  or bolster your ego. the mere thought that arrives when seeing things is a form of adulteration  the same goes for the words that your reading.   you do not need to invent anything  just observe.,2021-11-19 18:07:08
55718,anyone else stay up late at night watching youtube or netflix  and get so involved and invested in whatever the hell it is you re watching listening too  that the world seems to disappear and time stops  and you re in your own little bubble that is so fucking comforting that nothing else matters  the only thing you want is to stay in that bubble and enjoy the only ounce of joy you get throughout the day.   and then  finally you re content enough and the softness of the pillow and blankets is enough to make concentrating impossible. and that s just enough happiness to give tomorrow a try.   or is that just me ,2020-08-12 01:13:11
41299,hey... i start by apologizing if my english isn t as coherent as it should be  but english isn t my first language.  for a few years now i ve been  battling  with depression. i think it started when i started highschool. but i was never a really happy kid before that. i m a 22yo gay men who lives in a really small town... ever since i can remember i suffered from bullying. not just for being gay or acting a little bit different from other guys my age  but also about my image. my family was quite supportive with me being gay  strangely enough since i live in a really small town   besides my dad... i never told my dad i was gay. my father in my teenage years got really sick with this disease associated with tobacco  he smoked a lot even after being diagnosed. he died last year because of it... but he never really was a loving father to me or my sisters  but i cared him either way.   my depression has gotten a lot worse in the last few months progressively. i don t have many friends. i mean  i almost have no friends since even the ones i think i have don t care that much about me when i try to talk to them. i tried talking with my mother about this  but she doesn t seem to quite understand how bad it as gotten. i started to feel really lonely and i started going out to have sex with random guys just to try and feel something  to feel wanted. literally almost any guy who was available to pick me up on grindr i would have sex with... last month i tried to kill myself with some anxiety pills i had and mixed them with a lot of alcohol. didn t work. i fainted 3 times and after the third i regretted it and made myself eat something and got better.  i smoke a lot  drink a lot. started to smoke a lot of weed also  anything i can get my hands on to try and forget all these awful thoughts in my head i do.  i feel such emptiness  numbness and desperation. it s like i m a failure and that i ve already ruined my life so much that it is impossible to be happy again. i don t even feel sad anymore  it s much worse... i feel this terrible hopelessness. and it feels like i m going insane when that happens... i try to draw or do something to keep me distracted from it but it s getting harder and harder to do so. i just wanted to reset everything to the very beginning or erase my existence completely. this world is fucked up. i can t even fathom why someone would want to bring kids into this world. i now can say that i don t really want to die... but everyday it gets harder and harder to live with myself  i hate myself. i m disgusting. can t make friends  cant even do any subject in college  i tried to take my drivers license and failed miserably. i m stuck. don t really have interest in the things that i used to love doing. can t show emotions  don t know how to. and yes  i tried therapy for a few months but stopped going...   and it doesn t help that on my first sexual experience i was abused  when i was 17.   sorry if it s too long  just wanted to clear some things of my head. even though what i feel is much more complex than that.,2020-06-20 22:08:21
192502, 22f  i suffer my general anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. my now ex boyfriend  we broke up a month ago  used to gaslight me a lot and push me into panic attacks and depressive spirals  but i still loved him deeply despite of that.  i recently found out that he used me as a rebound and only wanted sex from me. now that he is done using me  he has tossed me aside like i am nothing.  this has worsened my anxiety and depression and even though i am on antidepressants  every waking moment is so painful. i hadn t stepped out of the house for weeks and i m either crying or having panic attacks.   he s all fine while i m suffering. i was good to him and i believe in doing good to others while he makes use of people and manipulates situations to his benefit. i don t understand why i am going through this and every night i beg god to kill me. i beg him to stop my heart in my sleep.  i cannot kill myself because i m afraid of what it d do to my parents when they find my lifeless body from self harm. if i had died from a heart attack in the middle of the night  it might be easier for them to live with.   god  please just kill me.,2021-12-18 09:25:42
96797,i also feel mentally exhausted. i find it ridiculous to continue standing  i m just still alive because i don t know how to kill myself. my story begins in 2014 when my mother was detected with brain cancer  after seeing how she was slowly dying and every time she visited her when she was 10 years old  she cried. she died after my father did everything possible and going into debt to pay for treatment that was expensive for us. after this trauma  family problems began with my maternal family with my father and i was in the middle of both. i loved them  but without realizing it they hurt me a lot because of their hatred for my dad. as i grew older i became frustrated for not finding the pleasure of living  many times i tried to make an attempt on my life until i was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. i was already 14 years old at that time and yet i still felt that i had nothing left to live for  since i could not find the reason to be happy  and drugs such as marijuana worsened my mental health even more. in the psychiatric hospital i met a very pretty girl with whom i fell in love  being a psychiatric hospital for minors  there were no spaces for boys and girls  they had us together . the days inside were eternal  every second refused to move forward. the nurses let us watch movies among everything on her computer  i wanted us to see the tombs of the fireflies by studio gibhil. i was talking with her and her name was rosa. we talked about anything and we were both in the same state of not being alive anymore  but when a feeling was born when i saw her  i felt good  i no longer felt so alone. after i was discharged from her  i left her my number and we talked  i was also going to see her. we had a relationship of 8 months  it lasted 8 months because she committed suicide on 10 20 2019. it still hurts me  it was the first love i had  i really loved her like anyone loves her partner. after this experience my condition worsened even more  i did not eat anything all day  and all day my chest hurt and i was lying in bed doing nothing  and when i say all day  i mean 24 hours. it s been a year and a few months still haunt my thoughts and memories. i hate being alone  alone with myself  alone with my thoughts  i don t know how to distract them so that they leave me alone  then the anger and helplessness of not being able to do anything arises. i am currently feeling somewhat better  but not quite. life becomes a heavy burden for me that every day becomes heavier. they tell me that life is a divine gift  but that every day that i wake up  it only brings me more suffering. i m quite corrupted,2021-01-02 13:38:27
2745,for a while now i have been interested in the idea of meditation  gave it a go a few months back but i felt like i was not getting the just of it. was wondering a few things if people could share a few podcast authors or some people who make videos or programs for beginners that i could take a look at.  would be greatly appreciated,2021-06-23 11:15:48

68815,i ve been diagnosed with depression anxiety at 17 but have very vivid memories of texting my friend that i want to down a bunch of advil when we were in 6th grade..so i think i have a long history of it. i started taking antidepressents when i was 19 up until this year  i m 24 . i started with lexapro for a couple years  then added wellbutrin and abilify. around april  i noticed that my anxiety was lower than it s ever been and my depression felt pretty stable so i decided to get off the wellbutrin.  well  now i think i m starting to experience the effects of depression again. i m not sure whether it s triggered by my pure hatred for my new job  the fact that the country feels like it s in shambles  or just another good ol  depressive episode. either way  i hate everything right now and just feel extremely helpless and lost.  so a couple months ago i began noticing that i ve been a lot more on edge with my boyfriend lately. it s been a huge issue in the past  but i thought it was just my depression manifesting itself as anger so i figured i could sort this out. lately  i ve noticed that i m really only ever in a bad mood around him. not even just in a bad mood  but constantly on edge. he ll make a dumb joke that i probably would ve found funny in the past  but instead i just snap and say something rude to make him feel bad for no reason. i ve also been drinking a lot more because it s the only way i m able to spend time with him without being a complete asshole. also  i almost never want to have sex with him. i mean  i also could easily live my life without sex in general. but..he s a guy so unfortunately that s not an option.   i just feel so confused and depressed because i know how great of a person and partner he is. he s helped me through so much and we have so many shared interests and hobbies. i don t necessarily want to lose him..but i also know how horrible i m being. i don t think it s fair for either of us to continue like this.  has anyone else ever felt like this  could this just be a normal phase in a long term relationship  could this just be the depression taking over  or does this sound like something serious ,2020-10-01 20:24:47
14760,so this is my secret shame a life lesson 33 years in the making. an undeniable truth. i m not crazy. i could be. not about this. i am getting the sinking feeling im getting gas lit by life. it starts out as normal as anything. i am generally treated well by my  friends . this goes beyond them. this relates to many people i ve encountered in my life. do i show signs of weakness  then why after a time does the mood of the room change and i end up being disrespected  it starts out as a flippant comment here and there then i will be put under someone s thumb. they think they can talk to me anyway they want. one day happy to see me the next annoyed and terrible. this is none more evident then my last relationship. no freedom absolute control on her part. my first relationship before that she just admitted she knew she could walk all over me and she did. sometimes i m a second thought or the third wheel. i want so bad to be alpha but i continue to come across people who would use thoughtless words to usurp my confidence and self worth. i am seen as weak and i am treated as such. anyone else trapped in a twilight zone episode ,2020-03-18 17:42:37
186919,my depression has come and go in intense episodes over the years and recently a really difficult breakup along with built up stress and social anxiety has left me feeling like i cant do anything at all.  but this time im in my first year of university and finals are just around the corner and i have 4 quizzes this week and i need to get my shit together but i feel like i just cant do anything. i cant read or bring myself to rewatch lectures or do practice or study at all.  i dont even feel like procrastinating by playing games and if i try watching stuff i cant enjoy it because im stressed about not studying but i cant. i dont feel like talking to anyone even though i want to   . honestly just writing up this reddit post took so much energy,2021-11-27 15:57:41
91282,hi guys.  i signed up on reddit for this section so i can get over this sad moment in my life. this condition that i have had for about 5 years has ended me from one day to the next.since high school and until now in college i could not have any relationship  instead i finished with excellent grades and even entered a military academy.  rather than do what i wanted to do  i preferred to see my parents proud of me because i chose what they wanted me to take. i have friends who are not really friends  every day i feel more and more vulnerable  sad  alone  i started to hate the people around me and i can t get along with them to be happy without being overthinker like me. every day i think about taking my own life  but when i know that my parents will suffer better  i wish i hadn t been born.  only on this site and under this anonymity of names can i express my situation without being judged.    ,2020-12-16 23:54:32
195996,went through christmas and new year alone. no one greeted me out of their accord. only sent well wishes after i sent them holiday greetings. i m away from family and friends. fianc  is six thousand miles away too. i m in a transient place  waiting for my visa for another country to be approved. it s been delayed  so it s driving me nuts. hoping since the holidays are over  my visa application will be dealt with soon. been unemployed for a year. savings depleted. i ve been affected by delays because of covid in many ways. i know i should be appreciative of the fact that i have a roof over my head and i eat three times a day. however  deep inside  i m feeling stuck. can t start something new because i just feel so low. and this holiday season made my loneliness feel worse. seeing family  friends  and my fianc  having a great time during the holidays just made me feel sad. i speak to my fianc  everyday  but now i don t want to say how sad or low or anxious i am because i don t want to sound exhausting to him. there are days when i am able to get up and go out and do stuff  but most days  i feel low. most of the time  i wait for night to come so i can sleep. sleep seems to be the time when i am happiest because there s none of that feeling of being stuck  alone  or low.,2022-01-01 22:38:21

5994,i have been meditating for 12 years on and off. i restarted the practice recently  and i achieved a new milestone this morning  i could watch my breathing without controlling it.  i usually focus on breathing while meditating  sensation at the tip of my nose   and until now  it has always made me regulate when to inhale and exhale. it forever annoyed me because it is not an actual observation if you control it since you re attached.  i wanted to share how i achieved this thing   during the previous sessions  i noticed that i forgot about breathing when my thoughts wondered. so at the moment when i caught my mind losing focus  i immediately turned my attention to the overall sensation of breathing  not just back to the tip of my nose. this made me realize that normal breathing is more subtle than i thought. so at first  i just took less air in than before. and then i kept repeating this  sensing the whole breathing before turning  exercise a few times  and eventually  i saw that my breath kept going without me forcing it.  i haven t mastered this technique yet  but i think i am on the right track.,2022-01-04 14:32:33
2237,learned this the hard way. my wife and i found an apartment complex we really liked and visited during the office business hours.  we got the grand tour and were told that its open parking and you can park right in front of your building. of course during the day there is lots of open parking. so we signed our lease and thought everything was going to work out great. wrong. come to find out there are less spaces available than how many units are in the complex. it has been a nightmare  and if you arrive after 8pm good luck. moral of the story is take a drive at night before you sign. nothing worse than not being able to find parking.     ,2021-05-03 00:49:58
190671,just went through a breakup a few days ago and i feel empty. she was my friend too. so i ve lost a friend as well. one of two.   my life is sedentary  dull  lifeless. lived overseas for five years and had no friends for five years. came back to my home country  and found out that i m terrible academically on top of being socially inept. woke up every morning feeling dead and without direction. lost passion for writing and everything else some time ago.  i know i m a loser  i ve tried to change it  got into self improvement and started exercising. but i still feel the same. numb. dull.   and then she came. our school had a thing where half of the class would go to school every week  and i was there with her. she was the only one who would talk to me. i arrived and she grabbed my hand and dragged me around school  laughing  smiling. i felt it there. something. something that i ve never felt before. euphoria   she is the opposite of me  by the way great academics and social life  walks around as if she would die if she shut up for a second whereas i rarely speak at all. she spoke  i listened. i liked that. she pulled me out of the class and we went to the back of the school and she spoke about her life and cried and i listened and we hugged for a long time. she confessed to me the same day later through text. i asked her to reconsider if she really liked me and she said yes.   then i lived the best three days of my entire life. we spoke to each other for most of the days  didn t care for exams. i lived. for the first time in a long time.   three days later she said she didn t think it was working out. told her to think it through again  but she was resolute  and i was finished. i panicked. and being the fool that i am i guilt tripped her. said i was gonna do something stupid  said that if anything happens it wouldn t be her fault but mine. she said she hated me  and shes right to.   now it s like before. hollow again. dead again. more than before. my world turned colorless again. i don t care about anything. i started cutting again. almost jumped a few days ago. i went for the suicide hotline. it helped  filled that emptiness for a second. now it s back.   i m just lost. no one to talk to. if dying wasn t so much of a bother i would ve died already. now i m just waiting for the opportunity. fuck everything.,2021-12-11 00:40:23

614, this guy and i had different expectations in the friendship.  i was putting in too much effort and he was doing very little when it came to initiating.  he wasn t interested in hanging out in person at the time either  mostly because he has his time dedicated to closer friends he s well established with .  he s entitled to this  but when i brought up that the one sidedness was frustrating to me  he seemed indifferent and said he d respond if i messaged him  but he s not looking to be tight knit friends.   so i deleted his number.  it was a month since i last spoke to him and i posted an insta story with an inspirational quote.  he actually responded to it saying it s one of his favorites.  all i did was  like  the response  but i didn t get into further conversation.   maybe i m lost  but i don t think this means he wants to rebuild again.,2021-03-03 10:00:49
132043,i am finally at a stage in life where i am coping pretty well with things. i do still spend most of the weekend in an exhausted daze of self hatred and anxiety  but come monday  i am back at work  smiling  efficient  sociable and supportive.    the things that bugs me the most right now is that i have no one to vent to. i don t want people to worry or to take pity  but if i tell them how things really are  then that is exactly what they d do.   i hate it when people say that mental health and suicide is no laughing matter  because gallows humor is the only way i know to speak about these things. it is so nice to meet people who have the same deprecating humor as i do  because i reckon i ve found someone who have the same issues as i do. i mean  i feel sad for them  but it is nice to be around people who speak the same language.,2021-05-16 19:17:14

103034,there is so much fucked up shit happening to my brain. i m depressed and i have depersonalization that has completely taken my connection to the world and myself away. it s as if i don t even care about my life anymore.   i try to describe this unnatural situation and they brush it off. this is the worst thing that has happened to me all of my life. worse than all the death of close ones  worse than all the broken relationships  and the loneliness. i don t even want to try to communicate my symptoms anymore because i ve been dismissed so many times.   i m going through what i believe will be the worst stage of my life and i just want some sympathy. is it because i m a boy  i just have to tough it out and grow up  i feel dirty even typing this because it makes me feel weak. it s sad i ve been forced to feel this way. i shouldn t feel weak because i m reaching out to someone and i shouldn t be turned away when i do.  the times that stand out are when i had just finished telling my parents about how fucked up everything going on with me was and one of them told me i m not helping out enough in response. just some fucking sympathy is all i ask for. the other time i was asked  is there something wrong with your brain or your life   that one really hurt it made me feel like i m making this up and i m just a fuckup.   i ve been in treatment for six months and i haven t gotten better. at this point it feels like my parents are giving up. even before me  the one who s fucking experiencing it. they don t show empathy. they don t ask me about what s going on and they are hard on me. they think they are doing the right thing by pushing me to do the things that are supposed to make you better  but sometimes it s impossible. it can be the hardest thing to do the simplest task when you are in your worst state and i guess they don t understand that. all i really need is a shoulder to lean on.,2021-01-20 11:32:04
68171,i had rather be sad and pessimistic all the time rather than having a little good moment here and there and then becoming optimistic even slightly about the future and then  getting my hopes and expectations crushed miserably. i don t like temporary things so i don t like happiness that stays for me only for sometime followed by times of utter misery. i d rather just be sad and not have any expectations all the time because i hate getting disappointed time and time again and i am tired of putting in my energy every single time thinking things are going to change. if things ever change fine but i am not really going to ever hope that they change because i don t like the soul crushing feeling of disappointment which is overwhelming.,2020-09-29 09:35:03
91088,i m a 19 year old female  intj . for a past couple of months i m going down into a depression spiral. i can t go to a therapist and online therapy doesn t work for me. i can t reach out to anyone else because i ve isolated myself from a few friends i had. they don t really give a shit anyway. i have trouble sharing my feelings or being vulnerable with anyone. emotional support seems like a false hope and isn t helpful for me. this year has been really tough  my dad passed away and i didn t even get to see him in his final moments because he was in another country and flights were closed due to covid  after that a bunch of other problems which appeared at once out of nowhere really drove me crazy. i was always at the top of my class and now my grades are shit which makes me hate myself even more  the goal of getting good grades and being successful was the only thing that made me keep going but now i m failing at it too. fuck  i can t even cry  i just feel so hollow and dead inside. nothing excites me. everyday i wake up with my head full of same questions. what am i doing with my life  why am i so fucking stupid  what s the purpose of life  is it all really worth it  i feel trapped and life seems so pointless. i can t get rid of nihilistic thoughts. i m in a dark tunnel and i m afraid there is no light at its end. i m just spending my days the same way over and over again like my life is just a circle. i used self harm as a coping mechanism for a while  even that doesn t work now. i feel like i m the biggest failure that ever existed and i m always gonna fail at anything i ll try to do. i m so fucking done with this miserable life where everyday is a struggle to get through the goddamn day. no energy left  nothing. idk what to do  maybe i should take antidepressants without any prescription or maybe just end it all. but again  i don t have the courage to kill myself.,2020-12-16 12:20:32
74609,i literally cannot hold down a job for long   yet alone find one. my depression is too bad. i ll never get in a relationship or fall in love either. i m also unattractive and have a ugly personality. i m dumb  college dropout. no job interests me. it s all sucks. i d be working just to survive but it s all a lot of suffering. i can barely do anything. i m so screwed in life i might as well end it. also fuck professional help its only made me worse,2020-10-25 01:02:04

185415,i m very lonely and have always had trouble making and then maintaining friendships. i moved in with some people not too long ago who said that they enjoy hanging out together when they can. i was really excited when i moved in since i thought this meant that i would finally have people to hang out with. we don t hang out as much as i expected us to but it was definitely an improvement for me socially since i wfh and don t ever have opportunities to interact with co workers. even though i m still struggling with my depression  which i ve had since i was a teen and for some reason have always felt ashamed of and felt like i would be burdening others with it if i brought it up   i know it could be worse if i didn t have the social aspect that my roommates provide me with. i thought things were going well with my roommates until i overheard them talking that they don t like it that i hang around with them so much and they think that i m a bad pet owner since my pet eats late in the day since i sleep late  this is because the meds i take make me very sleepy and groggy and result in me getting up late . now of course i feel like shit and just want to cry my eyes out and now always feel bad about myself whenever i m in my apartment. i don t know what to do. i not only feel lonely but also feel like i m surrounded by others who actively don t like me which is just making my depression worse.,2021-11-22 01:03:26

5990,you mentioned that you can t give me what i want or need  the only thing i ve asked for is your time.  i never said right now  i never said be my girlfriend right now  i ve said from the get go time.  it s ok that you re not ready yet  but i thought that i ve shown you already that i know what i m stepping into.  you said you do like me  that should count for something.   unless you actually believe that there is no possible chance of this ever working    if that s the case ok.   if that is the case  why  do you think that i d end up resenting you because you re a mom first        i m not giving you a choice  maybe you should   i said i m into all of you  i meant that shit  retracted   what is scaring you away from me  you told me i m all of these things yet it s not enough    why are you running  talk to me  be my person so i can try to be yours. i know you have a wonderful support system around you.   i don t think this is worth throwing away already without giving it some time  i don t think i m worth throwing away.  tell me a moment when we spent time together where i did something to make you worry. no  i m not perfect  far from it...and yes you can find better when you re ready but man  i m pretty good and i know that every single day i ll do my best to put a smile on your face.  we ve both been through the ringer...this is finally something with some light.   don t throw me away  retracted    don t throw this away because it s scary. i m scared too...  i m worth the time  i m worth the chance.  you re worth putting every bit of effort into because you deserve it  i m just trying to show you and prove to you that someone will  someone will put that time in  as long as it takes  someone will put the effort in. not because they feel forced to but because they can and they genuinely want to.  running is easy  finding a partner that actually gets  respects and supports you...who looks at you in your craziest moments and grabs you by the cheek and kisses you  who sings footloose to you in the middle of a mall.  who after just a few days of knowing you  gets you something that shows that they understand you  that shit isn t common.    i don t wanna steal your freedom i don t wanna change your mind i don t have to make you love me i just wanna take your time  i don t have to meet your mother we don t have to cross that line i don t wanna steal your covers i just wanna take your time   i m the guy who says how he feels. you know this. i m the guy who fights.....  i m the guy who gave you a moment of peace in chaos  that gentle massage when you were trying to get the munchkin to sleep  who reassured you it was okay for me to leave that night because one of the munchkins was acting up and you needed to be a mom. that i didnt want you to feel like you had to make a choice between spending time with them or me. that i understand they will always come first.  i m kinda your guy...no i m not jacked or hot...or very interesting. but i m me  no bullshit  no resentment  no effort. me.  and i m into you  so what s your move  going to block me and eventually forget about me  it would happen  you d move on and find another  without a doubt.  but right now. i know even for a fleeting moment of your day a thought of me sparks up in your mind. i know that you think about all those times we ve done that little finger signal to come over and kiss each other.    what if i just pulled you close  what if i leaned in and the stars line up and it s our last first kiss what if one of these days baby i d go and change your name what if i loved all these what ifs away    i know you said you spoke to your friend already  but i ask you one thing. show her this  ask her her thoughts. maybe she ll same i m crazy  you already knew this   maybe she ll say to just block and move on.   maybe she won t.   what if  you gave this  me a chance when you re ready  what if it actually works. what if one day  you actually let me call you my girl.  always   ry     ps. you have my favourite pants damnit.            i needed a place for these thoughts  i couldn t send them to her. i d be too much  too intense  got too attached.   i don t know where to go from here....she made sure every day to tell me that i was special and amazing and this was a good thing...only to run.  i don t blame her though  i m not angry at her...i just want to hold her  and massage her again and reassure her that it s ok.   fuck.,2020-02-19 13:22:01
2296,i ve been friends with someone for about 7 years and i finally decided to tell her i wasn t sure if the friendship was working out. she talks a lot about herself which bothered me and also doesn t remember many details at all about me  eg number of my siblings  or ask me questions. i don t get the same intimate  i got your back vibe  from her most other girls. she just has a different personality than most of them  entp if you re into mbti  i m istj    she also always complains to her bf how lonely she was even though i was always reaching out to her. she takes 3  days to respond to messages and when she does respond we end up talking about her problems or problems about our friendship.   recently it s been toxic for me since i m so lonely and i reach out to her and am frustrated with her and then i m lonely so i reach out and the cycle continues. it s just really hard because i don t have anyone else i m that close to and i m at a new school with severe social anxiety which is stopping me from making friends.   i sort of broke off the friendship with her but not officially. she ll be going to a college this summer with no phones allowed so she was going to write letters to keep in contact with people but i don t even know anymore. i just wanted to finally say something because i feel like it was frustrating me so much for having any expectations at all. now i m feeling guilty and sad because we share so many experiences and memories together.,2021-05-16 18:52:20

104108, there s always been something wrong with me               i didn t learn quick enough didn t pick up simple skills until years later than most people i am 27 years old and don t feel like a functioning adult at all i have to concentrate and stress just to complete simple tasks like a child walking around in a mature body   i m married now and trying to support us but failing she deserves so much better than me i know deep down i will continue to let us down. a life spent beating your head against a wall is no life at all i m terrified of dying but even more scared of living like this and even worse dragging the people i care about down with me. i just want people to know i really tried i quit all the drugs and drinking and threw myself into menial jobs and took all the overtime i could get i did excersise and ate well  tried to pick up hobbies even though i m useless with no skills i tried to make it work with this broken fucking brain but i m just not cut out for this world.what s wrong with me was wrong from the beginning and is wrong all the way through me . i m so tired and just want to let go the burden of being a worthless deadweight is too much i know if i end it people i love will get hurt but surely i will hurt them more inadvertently blundering through life the way i am .,2021-01-23 17:21:16

2574,this might apply more to younger kids grades k 8 but there are teen and adult summer camps too   sign your kid up for summer camps. during the summer months most extracurricular activities for kids have about a week long class of some kind.   most of these are actually going to be in your city or town depending  so no need to have your kid be send off somewhere. the more specific ones you may need to travel to attend.   local camps that don t require you to sleep there tend to be cheaper. some you can spend the week away for the traditional camp experience.   letting your kid do these things during the summer can free up the rest of the year if you don t want to be dragging your kid from one lesson to the next and or having all these extracurricular activities impede on their school year.   this way they can also get a taste of what something is like without having to sign up and drop out after just one lesson  it s just a week.   this also saves a lot of money for those who can t afford to send their kids off to do extracurricular activities all year.   basketball camp  art camp  space camp  soccer camp  tennis camp  gymnastics camp  karate  etc.   not recommended for instruments since these require year round practice.,2021-05-11 12:22:21

201677,basically  im a new  adult  in terms of the american way of age. i am going to study in korea which btw uses a whole ass different way of seeing age. basically u can see it as ur age rn  1  since im technically 18 rn id be 19 in korea so the legal age is 20 in korea.   this whole shit happened after my quarantine. i thought things were gonna go smooth but it didnt. obviously cause if it did i wouldnt be here doing this. anyways since i am still 19 i am not an  adult . legally i become an adult after my birthday this year but im not one yet. this whole shit makes sense like theres no hidden meanings but just because my birthday hasnt passed  neither are both my parents with me  it has generated a whole lot of problems for me.  for starters i am 19 which makes me young enough  according to koreas rule at least  to not buy alcohol  not be able to create a bank account without adult supervision and make a phone number on my name. but this shit becomes confusing when i can buy alcohol at 19  i can create a bank account  but i cant create a fucking phone number on my name. its like the american way of  oh ur young enough so u cant buy alcohol but ur old enough to go to the middle east and kill ppl . its just bull fucking shit.  not being able to have my phone number on my name is the main reason im writing this. i cant really do much in korea. i cant order food at all  i cant create an id on apps necessary for korea shit  etc.   not only that  i came from the other side of the fucking country meaning  in theory at least  i should be accepted to a dorm which i didnt so now im gonna have to find a roon close by the uni. all good but after all that shit that has been happening i just am scared about everything now.   dont get me wrong i dont hate korea but i cant enjoy korea because of everything happening to me rn.  i am depressed but many ppl will understand that at some point ppl with depression just go along with depression. its not a good thing but usually it isnt reallg bad either. this whole fucking situation is just bringing me back to the painful days and i hate that. i dont want that. thats why im writing this i feel like if i dont i may go back to my old dumb habits i just dont.  tldr  2022 isnt my year,2022-01-24 07:51:11

14937,for the past 3 months  i ve been in a crippling depression. isolating myself from all my friends. barely getting out of the house. staying in bed most of the days. doing absolutely nothing productive. it s funny because in a way  i ve been self quarantining since january.  but what i ve come to realize is that a big part of my depression  which i feel is a common thread for most of us  is that i felt so alone and felt that no one could understand what i was going through and how hard it was to do daily things and get out of the house. now that most of the world has pretty much come to a stop  i feel somewhat at ease knowing that nothing is happening in the world outside and that we re all sort of in the same boat. in saying that  in no way do i wish the world had to go through this  i am just trying to find the silver lining. this situation has allowed me to realize what a privilege going outside and seeing your friends is and made me reflect about how much i took that for granted. i also feel way more connected than i have in the past couple months  knowing that the whole world is going through this together. it s sort of allowed me to refocus my energy from just thinking about my depression to realizing how although i felt so alone  we re all now in going through something together. there s been a sense of community and commonality that i think the world desperately needed. anyway  i just thought i d share because i know a lot of people are struggling right now and i ve always tried to find some kind of silver lining in any situation so if this helps in any way  i ll be happy. sending love to you all and i hope everyone is staying safe. for those who don t feel as connected and need someone to talk to  i m here.,2020-03-19 11:38:52
7010,last week  i decided to reduce a lot of petty cash payouts i had gotten at work because the envelop i keep them in was getting a little thick  i use this as a  mad money  savings plan for spending money. don t laugh  it paid for my flat screen .   even though i watched the teller count out the  100 bills  when i counted them after i left it was  100 short. now  it could have been an honest mistake. i went back and reported it to the branch manager in case her count at the end of the day was over. but 4 days later and no call email suggests i just learned a very expensive lesson.    this was at a chase in a upper income area of los angeles ,2021-09-07 16:40:00
866,when you have a puppy  you should be constantly touching it s feet  messing with their ears  playing with their teeth  and lightly grabbing their tail.   this isn t to bother them  it s to make medical and hygiene care better and easier in the future. imagine going to the doctor for an ear ache and then going to bite his hand every time he touched your ear to look.   it s also to teach your puppy some tolerance  so that when the annoying toddler grabs their tail  they don t snap at them.,2021-03-12 04:18:08

174605,for the past few days  and couple weeks  i ve been struggling to actually think happy and be nice.  i m a young person  as i m only 20  so i have a long time to live  but recently i ve been feeling like cutting myself  sleeping constantly  and fighting my own thoughts. nobody messages me anymore  nobody really cares about me anymore  and every time i try and hangout i just end up getting pushed into the background. i ve been sleeping constantly to get away from my problems  only for me to have to go to another day of work in morning. my productiveness in said job is dropping  and fast  with every day that goes by i just sit idly for a few more minutes than the last. i ve felt horrible  i can t eat  my brain hurts  i feel like crying  and cutting myself no longer helps  it hurts too much and doesn t make me calm for much longer than sleeping.  i ve also been getting desperate for attention  as i m like an introverted extrovert now. i just want someone to say hi  to talk to  to hug.  but guess what  i can t  because everybody is to busy with themselves. i m happy for them  and not everything is about me  i get that. but i just want someone to love other than family in general.  speaking of family  i feel like if i told them i would be considered a  defect  or something along the lines of that. i love them  i really do  but i don t think they would understand me.  sorry for the rant.,2021-10-15 23:22:44

64876,i was doing so good for the past month or two.. but now everything is going downhill again. i was doing good at managing my time with school and work but im so fucking overwhelmed. i stopped taking my zoloft because it screwed up my appetite and i ended up losing 10lbs in one week and i felt like i became more depressed. now im considering taking it again because i dont know for what reason. i just want to stop feeling like this why did it all come back. why wont it leave me alone. why why  why why why hwy,2020-09-16 00:43:54
411,i ve started trying out meditation to help with my stress and anxiety however i m having trouble with the sitting position required  both in my legs and in my back.  my legs start aching and quickly become numb and tingly when i sit on the floor. i guess i can fix this one by sitting in a chair or on a cushion but is there any way to fix this issue  maybe with some sort of specific exercises or stretching   another problem is with my upper and lower back  when i try to sit up straight like instructed i get aching pain in my upper and lower back and i struggle to maintain the position. this causes me to struggle to get into the correct mindset. how could i improve this   i feel like without removing these issues i can t start to feel the benefit of the practice,2021-02-20 13:46:06
117383,m 25 . i don t really know where i went wrong. i ve had my fair share of problems throughout life  but i always seemed to have enough strength willpower to carry on.  also i don t want to think about past problems and really need to let out my negativ emotions for the present    but now  everything is just to much. i can t remember the last time i fell asleep without looking at the ceiling for at least 4 hours. i also can t remember the last time i felt appreciated. my dad  amp   ex step dad never really cared for me. the only thing they care about is when i will finish my studies so they don t have to pay child support. right now i m studying computer science but by the end of the month i will propably have failed my last chance with one of the exams. i had made a plan b  and c   but my mother crushed those. telling me i am not smart enough  to lazy etc. she wants me to have a realistic plan till the end of the week that she can tell her friends about. she wants that bc she doesn t want other people to think  she failed as a mother . she just sees me as a failure. not suitable for anything. she used to scream at me that i remind her of my father. which is so much bullshit. the only thing we have in commen is looks and general hatred for each us. everything else we have no common grounds.  religion  politics  food  hobbies.  which making her say i m just like him really hurtful.  i just don t know what to tell her. i took months for my last ideas. it is just so hart to come up with a plan for the future  when you are not even sure u want to have a future.  i just feel lonely. but that is my own fault too. i have never been in a relationship and i don t know parental love. there were times when girls were interesseted in me. but i always pushed them away  bc deep inside i think that i do not deserve any kind of affection. i can t even take compliments. not that i would have a chance now.  sometime in the last years i began eating like trash whenever i felt sad. and since i felt sad almost everyday anyway i m now overweight and began hating my body.  i ve given up on the premise that things will get better. bc i just can t imagine how.   and if things can t get better i just don t know how long i can bring up the strength to carry on.    so in short. can t sleep  failed studies  disapproving parents  self hatred  amp  no hope for the future.  if you read till here  thank you for listening. and sorry for the mistakes i m not a native speaker.,2021-03-16 00:44:21
48891,if we went over my whole life s problems it would be a long write up. between being homeschooled since seven which felt like prison  seeing my those die of cancer a month before my 16th christmas  seeing my dad put a gun to his head multiples time from not being able to handle it all  basically being alone or at least feeling major anger and deep depression after 16  current  being diagnosed with crohn s disease at 19 while being severely poor and working two jobs  befriending my step brother which is and always will be my best friend and having him die in a freak accident two weeks before his 21st birthday  severe agony with my illness  and most recently having my dad kill himself last october. shortly after he did so i got in a bad motorcycle wreck and went through five months of physical therapy. i talk to a therapist and honestly besides coping mechanisms i don t think it really makes me feel better.. i ve never felt a genuine happiness that lasted more than a day. i surprisingly look forward to work because then i can be distracted from it all. once home i m just reminded how fucking alone i have been and always will be. i dunno why i m even writing this.,2020-07-16 21:45:41

93822,i feel so fckin unlovable right now i don t understand why i have to be so alone and so miserable. so much f ed up shit has happened to me in the last few months i feel like i m at my breaking point. i don t do anything but go to my shityy minimum wage job and do drugs everyday to feel numb and forget everything. the only guy i ve ever loved manipulated the hell out of me and left me w nothing but a hard drug addiction and an inability to trust anyone. i don t even have enough money to pay rent at the end of this month so i m wondering if it s even worth it to live that long..,2020-12-25 01:29:26
7253,it is relatively easy to check   i ve had to use https   www.fema.gov flood maps  in my profession for engineering compliant building mep systems  so knew about it as an information resource .   there is no federal regulation requiring any seller  including hud  to disclose flood risk to potential buyers. most buyers find out their new house is prone to flooding when they are notified that they must purchase flood insurance  which happens so late in the homebuying process that it is often too late for families to back out of the purchase  per npr.org .  hopefully this helps fellow american redditors avoid these areas  and inspires others to investigate for the same concerns elsewhere.,2021-09-14 05:41:17

94920,everynight i go to bed thinking how worthless my life is. at night i am constantly reminded of the stupid mistakes i made and i am just so sad. i am constantly comparing myself to other people and trying convince myself that i am the  supierior person .  other people see me smiling but its me just desperatly trying to look like im  so happy . my brothers just insult me and i am completly alone with no friends. everyone at school is smiling and laughing and i just seem to not exist. as a highschooler i feel i should be making great memories but all i am doing is spending time on my ipad all day addicted and seeing how talentless and pathetic i am just makes me want to cry. i hate myself for being so short and ugly  and  hate myself for being a porn addict. ive tried so hard to stop but i cant and i feel terrible for the way i view women. im just wasting my terribe life which i feel is not going to get better   i always told myself things will get better but now its been so long im afraid it will be like this for the rest of my life and im scared. i just want to be happy before i get older so that i feel i didnt waste my childhood,2020-12-28 02:46:40
262,on the surface it may seem like things are always going wrong  but this is because we only see things through a limited perspective.  if we could see the outcome of every  bad  thing that happens to us we probably wouldn t even label it  bad . it s hard to see and accept this when living from the mind  but once you start living in the present more this becomes very clear. everything is fine  and even when it doesn t seem or feel fine  that s also fine.  this realisation had such an impact on me that it inspired me to write a song called   everything is fine   https   open.spotify.com track 6jc0ychjyffyttwoog3ubk si 06740de71f914bc0   and one of my favourite lines from it goes    gt  i found peace in my self now everything is fine     gt     gt  it could rain  it could storm and everything is fine . ,2021-02-14 08:03:18
101765,im kinda new to reddit but have been following the depression thread for a while. im 29 years old and have been dealing with depression since i was about 16 years old. i usually manage to keep it under control  with some tougher moments during winter  and also going into therapy several times . however for the last half year or so its gotten out of control. due to corona my social life  which is mostly in the event industry  has been put on halt and with it most sources of positive energy. the fact that i have had no partner for years and am living alone doesn t help  im lonely. ive taken up therapy again  i work out daily  found new hobbies to keep my mind occupied  but nontheless the depression has gotten to a point i ve never been before. everything in my mind is extremely dark  up to the point of having to parry intrusive suicidal thoughts on a daily basis. i am aware that these thoughts are not my own  but part of the depression trying to drag me down further. im so damn tired of having to fight this mental struggle every day  im becoming desperate because of it. not sure why i am writing this here  but i just had to vent my thoughts and i guess im also looking for some comfort  people to share this with  who perhaps experience d  the same and who can provide some advice or words of comfort. anything would be appreciated.,2021-01-16 20:08:12

138512,it s game set match for me. spent so much of my existence living to earn enough money to be able to support people that when it comes to myself i spend it with the idea of fulling the system so i have a purpose to keep living. during this whole pandemic i ve come to realize that if i don t start to aspire for something deeper than money and how useful i am to people because i either have it or can help them make it i going to end my life before i can actually enjoy existing. i feel this is the biggest block to why i can t form intimate relationships with people anymore and it fuels my cynicism.   i just want to vent and will delete after some sleep and hopefully taking my meds. been forgetting to do that a bit sadly after so long of keeping up with them.,2021-06-08 04:13:41

406,    so  what had happened was...  i owned my last car outright. i traded it in and bought a new car recently. what follows is the demand letter i wrote when they tried to get me to pay for their mistake. only the names and relevant information have been changed. they complied the day after i sent it. i honestly had too much fun with this.          17 february 2021         to  dumbfuck mc poopypants         re  2008 scion tc vin  g0f15ty0ur531f455h0l3 title lien         mr. mc poopypants          i have made every attempt to resolve this matter in a civilized manner. you interrupted me and wouldn t let me finish when i tried to explain this to you over the phone so i have no choice but to make this a formal legal matter. let s not mince words. i used to sell cars and i know how you people operate. i ve seen underhanded deals with resulting lawsuits before. i m not the average ignorant consumer you can just roll over. you had the opportunity to get out of this situation quickly and quietly. you no longer have that opportunity. the civil attorney with 25 years of experience in title law with whom i consulted informed me that i would not need him because i have an airtight case against you. he said  and i quote           take that lien and shove it up their ass. it s their fault. they missed it. they own it now.          if you do not comply with this demand letter  i will have no choice but to take legal action  which i am entirely prepared to do. you will lose. pursuant to statute 12.341 a.r.s.  you will also be held responsible for my legal fees of  450 per hour plus expenses  plus penalties  plus compensation for the backlog of hours i have wasted doing your job for you and investigating your mistakes.          be advised that this letter will be tendered in court as evidence of your failure to comply with the law and your attempt to defraud me. this has the potential to cost incompetent dumbfucks  inc significantly more than the  1 050 that you ll be paying off for me immediately whether you force me to take you to court or not. this is entirely your decision.         pursuant to the law regarding automotive title liens in goat rodeo county  your dealership missed a first in time  first in right occurrence that you should have caught three separate times. this requires a release of wrongful lien for which incompetent dumbfucks  inc. is 100  responsible.         on 30 december 2020  i purchased my 2008 scion tc vin  g0f15ty0ur531f455h0l3 which will remain in my possession. unbeknownst to me  i had outstanding fines in two areas totaling  3850  which in turn caused the lien on the title  which should have been found through your due diligence and prevented the sale from ever going through in the first place. upon consulting the goat rodeo county collector  i was informed that processes and procedures had been provided by the county specifically to make it easier for auto dealers to find such discrepancies and prevent this exact situation from occurring because it had been such a frequent problem for so many people.          apparently  your third party title company was able to make the  2800 from my unrelated case disappear. based on your suggestion  i spoke to someone who worked at the mvd and they informed me that that happens not infrequently because they make so many mistakes. they informed me that third part title company employees have 10  of the training that mvd employees do but that managers are typically former mvd employees with connections who can clear fines with a mouse click if they get the right person to do them a favor. the fact that they did so sets a legal precedent of responsibility on your part. guilt has already been established. if they were not liable  they would not have done that. since they are liable  you are liable as well. what remains is two abandoned vehicle fines for  500 each and a  50 fine for driving uninsured totaling  1 050. due to the fact that you missed this in your due diligence three times  you have inherited 100  financial responsibility for these fines.         due to the aforementioned provisions  this deal never should have happened three times over. you missed it three times. you failed to do your due diligence three times. this is an impressive level of incompetence. i will not be held accountable for your ineptitude. directly after the deal was finished and the 2008 scion was officially in my possession  i went to the motor vehicle division to register for handicapped license plates  to which i am entitled due to my various disabilities. upon discovering the lien  i attempted to return the car in good faith. you told me that everything was fine  that the lien would transfer and that the only issue would be that i would not be able to sell or trade in the scion until the fines were paid off. whether it was incompetence  negligence  fraud  or some combination of the three  i received wrong information and made a major financial decision based on that wrong information. if i had been given the correct information  i absolutely would have backed out of the deal.         this is fraud.          i m willing to give you the benefit of the doubt under hanlon s razor and assume this was not intentional fraud  but simply gross incompetence  which is the only thing you and your employees have displayed consistently. the fact remains that it is fraud  whether intentional or not  and it falls upon your dealership to resolve it to avoid further legal action  which i will absolutely take if you force my hand.         the fact that i informed your dealership of the lien when i attempted to return the scion in good faith should have alerted you that there was a problem but you missed it again and went ahead and sold my 2007 ford crown victoria police interceptor vin  y0ul053n33dl3d1ckd1p5h1tf4c3 at auction. this was the 2nd time that you failed to do your due diligence. upon finding out that the new owner of my trade in had spent  1200 on new parts in good faith  you asked me to pay for your mistake. this was completely unethical but in no way out of character for a car dealership. without my help  you corrected the error on your end. i m sure a massive corporation like incompetent dumbfucks  inc. won t have a problem coming up with the rest. that is what will happen with the remaining  1 050 due to the fact that every last one of the plethora of failings in this situation is 100  your fault.          furthermore  you threatened to repossess my car  which you do not have the legal right to do  in an attempt to intimidate me into paying for your egregious error yet again. this was even more unethical but certainly no less within your purview. at the bottom line  you re trying to get me to pay for your mistakes. i will not be intimidated. you will not get dime one out of me. this is 100  your problem. you re taking a bath on this deal and there s nothing you can do about it.         upon receiving my interceptor back  since i still had the chance of backing out of the deal  i asked blumpkin stankyballs again to make sure i would not be immediately liable for those fines. he reaffirmed what i had been told previously  that my car was already registered through the dealership and i would be receiving my license plates in the mail. i also spoke with douchebag van assbreath during the transaction and he yet again affirmed what i had been told. i did my due diligence by confirming this with both of them. i took them at their word based on the fact that they do this for a living. this was the 3rd time you failed to do your due diligence. the attorney i consulted said he had never seen a case this badly bungled. the extreme carelessness and aggressive incompetence displayed by you and your employees time and time again indicates that you people simply do not know how to do your jobs.          i will not be a victim of your negligence.         as i mentioned  the official legal way for you to resolve this matter is through a release of wrongful lien action. i suggest you consult your legal department and get that process started.          alternately  you might want to take up a collection among the employees involved so no one loses his job. if i were your general manager  i d be handing out pink slips like they were parking tickets. if you would prefer to send me a cashier s check or money order for  1 050 made out to the goat rodeo county collector  i would be more than happy to pay off the fines through the standard means to make this easier for everyone.          it is in both of our best interests not to take this to court  but i need to make sure this is abundantly clear  based on the rock solid case i have against you  you need to understand in no uncertain terms that i absolutely will take this to court without hesitation and pursue it to the fullest extent of the law for as long as it takes to protect my rights. you have been warned.         please inform me of how this matter has been resolved no later than 26 february 2021 and approximately when i should expect to receive my license plate and registration. i will need to know by which method you have chosen to rectify the outstanding  1 050 so i can take the appropriate steps.                  do not   force me to take you to court. you don t know who you re fucking with and you don t want to find out.         sincerely          ginatninja42   amp  x200b    to avoid confusion if you re doing the math  i sold my previous car for parts with the lien still on it. the  1200 in new parts they had to cover translated to another  825 from my buyer. ,2021-02-19 00:12:09
63109,i m going through a divorce and haven t gone outside in weeks.  even the thought of walking down the street for some take away makes me feel absolutely awful  i haven t been able to do it  despite every morning telling myself  today i will.   i can t even seem to order delivery.  advice is always to talk to friends and family  but i have no one in this country.  moved across the globe to be with my spouse and now my life is just over after years of trying and loving.,2020-09-09 04:13:32
83188,il try and explain this the best i can. i m a dude  18 years old. my depression and feelings of worthlessness started when i was about 10 years old. so everything was fine until my mother got really strict about me studying and having good grades. back then when i was small i tried my best to study and do good  however  it was never enough for my mother. every time i got a decent grade she would say that having a  medium grade  was awful and that i shouldn t be happy with that and should always get a perfect grade. obviously this took a toll on me as i was never able to meet her expectations. i stopped having any motivation to study  which just made things worse. my mother would get mad at me more often  and yell that i was lazy. eventually  i would cry before going to sleep  calling myself worthless  useless  and a waste of space. this went on until i was about 14 years old. eventually i came to accept the fact i was a failure  and that i didn t deserve to live on this planet. i did try talking to my mother about how i felt once  however  all she said was  what are you talking about  stop joking . and i could see in her face that she didn t belive i was depressed  she even got annoyed. so i never tried talking to her about it again. so after somewhat accepting that i m a failure my depression died down a bit. i still felt like i didn t deserve to live  and that i was worthless. but i didn t cry myself to sleep every night so that was a plus. i have though about taking my life many times over the years. once almost actually doing it by jumping off the roof of the building we lived in. but i backed off and decided not to. so after that things were  alright  for a while  yes i would get occasionally depressed  and my feelings 9f worthlessness would come back. but i was able to manage. now the reason i m writing this is because  recently my gf and i has sex for the first time. and one of my biggest insecurities is that my penis is small. obviously as a teen i had to google to find out. turned out it was average so nothing special there. however yesterday my girlfriend and i were talking on the phone  and i made a joke how my penis was small  she agreed to match the joke and everything was fine. then i decided to ask her what she really thinks about what i have  down there . and sadly  she said that for her it was small. this honestly destroyed me. one of my biggest insecurities turned out to be true. i immediately felt like shit after the told me that. she tried talking to me  and telling me she doesn t mind and that she loves me for who i am. but how can i ever feel good about myself  knowing that even my dick is worthless. that night i cried myself to sleep. i had hope that at least when i lost my virginity  at least that would be fine  at least there i would be happy. but no. i m worthless  in every aspect of my life. i m a complete fucking failure in everything i do. now after she told me the truth  i truly appreciated it  however  my self confidence is gone. my ego is ruined completely and i feel just like when i was a child and would cry myself to sleep. basically  i will never be good at anything in this life  no matter what i do.,2020-11-23 16:17:23

117844,i literallyyyyyyy    cannot stop cutting myself lol. started back up like 3 months ago after some shitty things happened in my life and things just kept getting worse from there. i m addicted to hurting myself and i actually like it. i deserve the pain. it makes me happy when i m doing my daily activities and i move in a way that makes my cuts hurt  brings me out of disassociation and reminds me that i hate myself. i heavily contemplate killing myself every single day too. i know it s bad but i upped my own medication and it hasn t done a damn thing so i m either just gonna take them all at once and see if i die or ask my doctor to change them. and i don t know the point of this post  i just like writing down my smooth brain thoughts. thx for coming to my ted talk.,2021-03-17 11:57:46
70204,first off  i m a gay man  24 years old who tries to cope with everything in my life with a character called jesse mccree from overwatch  i ve been obsessing over him since the day the game was released  i have a lot of photos of him in my google photos  had a lot of merchandise of him. basically  it s like he s my part of my life to get through  to get going. a reason to live  and i wish i was joking but i m not. i m a social anxiety person so i do not like to talk with a real people so that s why i m dependant on him all the time.  i had the first panic around late 2018 when blizzard is featuring mccree with a woman called ashe. my life was instantly going downhill at that point  had no hope and i don t know how will i cope without him.   however  michael chu  who was the writer back then  confirmed that they re not in a relationship. i was feeling relieved for a while.   however my life was feeling exhausted again since last monday blizzard announcing that there s will be a new mccree lore involving a woman  plus the faces i know that chu isn t a writer of blizzard anymore i m feeling afraid that blizzard could retcon  cancels anything that chu was writing about him  anything including the relationship with the woman called ashe.  i was afraid  lifeless and   feeling lost. i don t know how will i cope about this  how will i cope about the fact that i don t have anyone to help me get through my life anymore.  i was skipping a lot of classes this week and just don t want to get off my bed anymore. i don t want to eat even. i feel like life is pointless now without him to the one point i m planning to buy an nitrogen gas and a mask to just end myself. i can t live with this pain anymore.  i kept thinking about him all the time  he was my crush  an imaginary boyfriend. now he s gone just like that and i don t have anyone to talk nor explain my problem in real life.,2020-10-07 07:45:24
165843, in the last few years my life has become an everyday battle of trying to remain hopeful and finding moments of joy only to feel incredible sadness  self hate and wrestling with the harsh reality that i may never be happy or have peace from  intrusive thoughts. i used to have  bouts  of depression but it has become a daily struggle that i am finding difficult to fight.    i have become more reclusive and have been separating from people but i am fortunate to have a lot of support and love in my life. i work very hard in advocacy and have an active social and work life.    i rarely discuss this because i know i will be judged so i am writing this post to learn coping strategies other people have tried that helped them during deep and persistent depression. i am feeling exhausted and just want to find ways of living in the moment again.  thank you for any advice.,2021-09-13 20:48:30

11168,this works 99  of time. you can do this on your own  but it s much easier if you have someone assist you. get a bottle of water. stand straight  then hinge at the waste and bend over as if you re doing a romanian deadlift. aim for an angle between 35 and 90 degrees. look straight ahead of you. your back and neck should form a straight line. don t round your back  don t put your head down. straighten your arms  one arm if you don t have a helper  behind your back as if you re getting ready to jump forward. now slowly take small sips of water  one at a time. 4 5 sips would do. it will be very hard to swallow  but that s the point. be careful  don t rush it. that s it. if you did everything right  the hiccups should be gone.,2021-12-31 15:00:20

14206,i have been struggling from severe depression from almost a two years now. i have my super bad days and okay bad days and majority numb days. so  i have super motivated colleague at my research laboratory. she generally puts out lot of motivational tips and liners to stay motivated. she keeps posters of positive energy and all these posters are just two arms distance from my table. the first time i read them i felt  may be she needs help  who would be so positive  and why would someone want to be so confident about themselves  for instance one of the liners says    don t be afraid of the audience  if you re on the stage and they are not there is a reason behind it.     and then it stuck me  is it me or her  is it me who needs help  that i can t find good in the motivational quotes or positive vibes posters  or are they really cringe worthy ,2020-03-16 11:39:20
110,this happened today  and i learned a lot from the various police  repair people  and other  after event  people.  someone who lives near us has a video door bell.  they are also away hiding from covid.   the house looks well maintained  and people are looking after it.  today someone went to the house  rang the doorbell.   the person answered the door bell asking who was there.    the person wouldn t answer... he asked again why he was there  and said he wouldn t get up until he at least said who he was.  the burglar hit the door and forced it open... was in and out in a few minutes... with a small amount of cash on a table upstairs.  the burglar did look in to  see  if they could see movement based on the video.... but with no obvious other movement inside  hey it was installed because they spend a lot of time in the basement  just banged right in.  so don t let the advertising fool you   a video doorbell is to  make your life easier  but your not scaring anyone away with it.,2021-02-08 20:39:57
161820,i m not a native english speaker and even though i m fluent in english i m so exhausted  it s 2 am  that i will probably make a lot of mistakes in the following text.    i am 19 years old. i am a woman.   i am young  i know. i still have a lot of life left  i know. in fact  i m waiting for it  i have been waiting for the future since i can remember because i have had a terrible childhood and adolescence. my life  until now  has been full of abuse from my family  i had a partner who took full advantage of me and traumatized me when i was still malleable  i have had friends who have pushed me aside  not all of them  in general i have very good friends now   and now i  myself  am ruining everything for myself as i have created a lonely  sad  tired heavy stone who took full control of my body and soul. i have not had meaningful conversations with anyone in months  i don t remember being hugged so far this year  i have barely done anything in the last months because of how sad and tired i am all the time. i m in therapy  but i suspect that my psychologist  since she knows that my family environment is what has rotted me the most  knows that she can t do much for me and only encourages me two three weeks not to lose my mind  but i swear to god that i m about to make very bad decisions. i wish i had someone to share  but even if i meet someone i will barely text them back or make plans because texting is tiring to me right now and making plans means negotiating with my parents which i have always hated. i have pushed everyone away.  i get out of bed and can t bear my own weight from how little life i feel. i don t pay attention in class. if someone asks me something  i answer something nonsensical because my mind is not here. i m really very  very  very sad. i was this sad before when my ex partner took advantage of me  but at that point i had friends to lean on. i still have them  but if i look for them now  what am i even going to tell them    help me  i feel like life is slipping away from me    and then what  i will just worry them  and they won t be able to help me because we all are so young.  have you felt this way  what should i do  i would like to write  i like to write  but my days seem to go by in the blink of an eye. what should i do to focus or feel more alive  with more energy  not everything is lost i think  i m pretty smart and my mind is very creative  it is my happy place i just can t find the way to express what is going on there. i honestly don t know what else can helpme right now apart from expressing myself. the pandemic ended my plans to leave home  which was my old only hope  it is still my only hope  but now it is more distant . i place a lot of emphasis on my home because my parents absorb me of a lot of energy.  i m scared of ruining my life because of this depression. i m afraid of becoming a   she had a lot of potential   because i do have it. and a lot of dreams too. i just need less sadness and more energy.  i hope everyone who is reading this is having a good day lt 33,2021-08-30 03:48:52

1775,hey what s up  just a guy from europe looking for people  preferable from europe  to get known with and potentially become long term friends.  i like to talk about pretty much everything  but as with everyone  i have my boundaries. i m a mix between kind of serious and to not so serious. i can get along with basically anyone  as long as they re not toxic or just reply with 1 word all the time. i might not answer your message immediately  but i try my best to. there are various reasons as to why  like i might be busy doing something or just sleeping  but i try to answer your message when i have the time to do it.  it s no secret that i love gaming. my favorite games are valorant  r6s  apex and many others. i m more a competitive guy  but i can also play more casually. mostly just looking for a fun  casual time  and maybe doing stupid stuff too   . so we could totally play some games if you d like. i prefer using voice chat.  my other hobbies are watching anime  learning foreing languages  listenin to music. they re still very fun to do when i do get the time to do them. i m a pretty energetic and hardworking person  but have some days where i feel bit worse like everybody  i prefer to use discord  dont want to join any server ,2021-04-28 13:18:26
8012,one of my friends is constantly in a relationship and no matter how long or short the relationship is  it will constantly be tumultuous and she will bother me nonstop about it. she s done this to me for the past three years and this time i feel like i don t like who she is as a person but i am not sure if it is because of the pain of her relationship.  she found out her bf was cheating on her with his ex the entire two months they ve been dating. only two months  and she lost her mind  burned all their pictures and letters  got blackout drunk and then got him to come over and pick her up then she punched him in the face and screamed at him. he ended up texting me asking me to get her so she could leave. then she texted us that he drugged her and i was so worried and i was asking him what was happening.. he sent me pictures of her and she was fine and clearly not drugged. the next day she admits she just said that he drugged her because she was mad. i told her i can t ever accept that as being okay and she apologizes but i don t think she understands how damaging that is to someone s character. then she talks about how she wants to get back with him and he s going to take a polygraph to prove he didn t cheat even though she saw the proof he cheated on her phone. i feel so drained from this human being  i don t think i could ever look at her the same.,2021-11-04 02:53:24
129636,i ve been hospitalized and have had police come to my house a few times for telling close friends i was suicidal saying goodbye. i ve overdosed to try and kill myself  i still struggle with self harm here and there. when my partner and i would have huge arguments  it would put me in a headspace where i feel worthless and want to end my life  and i would tell him that. but  i would try to convince myself how much of a bad idea it was to attempt  and wouldn t. whenever i mention being suicidal  which at this point is only to my partner   i genuinely feel like i want my life to end so that my mental suffering can stop  but i can t bring myself to end it all. i m not lying when i mention that i have suicidal thoughts  but i never have enough motivation to do it. i was called attention seeking and that it was unfair that i got to tell him that i was suicidal and never actually go through with it. now i m overthinking and feel like maybe i am just an attention seeker or convincing myself i m more depressed than i actually am. i feel extremely ashamed of my mental health and my past related to it. can someone tell me what they think   tl dr i was told i was attention seeking because i ve told someone i was close to multiple times i wanted to kill myself but haven t done it.,2021-05-09 00:06:48
7895,one of my close friends posted in a private discord server  i hope everyone had a wonderful day today. i love you all so muchly  and i just feel like such shit because my fist impulse was to let her know that she was wrong. my day was in fact very shitty and it s so frustrating that i d rather say that then accept the sentiment and be cheered by her words. she also struggles with depression so it just feels like my impulse to respond with negativity is this weird desire to pull her down to my level.  like  i get that sometimes happiness is not possible but why do i frequently feel this impulse to be bitter and negative to the people supporting me ,2020-02-25 01:58:03

165294,i have had a rough couple of months leading up to now. i lost a longtime partner a couple months ago and reached a peak in my depression where i needed to reach out for help. since then i have been on prozac and been living on my own in a new city. i have struggled with depression my entire life  but i really started addressing it for the first time this year. i was beginning to self harm frequently  gain weight  and shut out my family and friends. since then i have had my good and bad days with depression and anxiety. on good days i wish i felt more because my emotions feel muted and dull. on bad days i would appreciate to feel nothing at all. especially recently  i have begun thinking about self harming again and feeling down more often. nights like tonight when my ex talks to me about how well her life is going makes it hard to be positive. i have always depended on others for happiness so it hurt a lot when she didn t want to be with me. i was already at a low point in my life and it was something i couldn t deal with on my own. i m just having a hard time getting through life right now and wanted to write it somewhere because i don t have anyone to talk to until i find a new therapist.,2021-09-11 23:39:03
4184,so  i ve realized something recently   as i ve gotten older  it has become harder and harder to make plans with friends and family. everyone has so much going on in their lives   like weddings  kids  dogs  vacations  work  relationships  school  and on and on. it gets even more complicated when i try to include our partners or more friends. there are so many calendars to juggle that it requires so much back and forth to the point that i stress over even making the first move to set something up. just finding an evening to do dinner can be such an arduous process. it is honestly resulting in me not seeing people i care about.  anyone else deal with this too  anyone do something  other than  text call to find a date time to meet  does anyone share their google apple calendars with friends and family  i know there are things like calendly and when2meet but they don t quite work for this. thanks in advance for the help ,2021-07-20 21:25:18
93410,i haven t been happy in years  and no matter what i do to dull that feeling of nothingness it always comes back. i m 18 now  just finished my first semester of college  and i m so empty. i was so thoroughly depressed and anxious in high school that i didn t manage to get anything done except alienate my friends and get grades that were somehow not horrible enough so i could get into my state school. no matter what i do  people always go away. i managed to keep one friend who i hung out with semi frequently  but he s pretty much gone too.   i thought he was my best friend  but recently he s done the whole drill of being busy  not wanting to hang out  etc. he attempted suicide earlier this year  and i ran over to his house the night he tried and supported him as much as i could throughout the rest of this year. i tried   so  so  hard to invest time into our friendship  and i thought it was mutual. despite quarantine  i made an effort to hang out with him through checking on him every day  starting a minecraft server so we d have something to do  making sure he was okay as much as i could  and keeping in contact with his family who i ve known for years. i m also into sneakers a lot  so i got him a very nice pair for his birthday too.  despite all the time i ve tried to spend over the 10 years i ve known him  apparently the feeling isn t mutual. this is the one absolutely stable friend i ve had for about 10 years since before i spiraled  and knowing that the friendship doesn t feel reciprocated has me hollow inside. he s made more friends over the past year  but none were there that night he attempted. imagine my surprise when i wake up and see a social media post with pictures of him and his friends  even tagging people who weren t in the pics. caption was  tagged is everyone who made this year bearable .  i m so  so tired. i can t find anything to fill this empty void anymore. i ve tried with money and sneakers  gave myself some artificial confidence by trying to make more than other people and having a massive sneaker collection  but none of it matters. my best friend apparently doesn t consider me the same way despite all i ve tried  other friends have pushed me away because i ve tried to vent  and i have nothing left. i can t even drown myself in alcohol or weed  the thought of alcohol makes me sick because my dad has a problem and the thought of weed makes me sick because all my brother does is smoke and mentally abuse me. i can t find a reason to keep going anymore  anyone i ll ever become slightly friendly with will eventually find out how horrible i am and leave me and my meds don t do shit for my anxiety anymore.  i don t even know why i m writing this. i m so lonely and i don t even know who i used to be or what being happy is anymore. burying that absolute emptiness and pain with money and sneakers has stopped working and i don t want to exist.,2020-12-23 17:01:38
11848,so i can t and won t ever stop loving him. i ve tried everyday and i can t let go of him. i will never love anyone else and i ve accepted that. it s basically like i m mourning the death of someone and won t ever recover from it. i wish i could just fucking die.,2020-03-08 05:57:04
5065,i was just thinking    many believe that we   we meaning our souls or collective unconscious   are here to have a human experience.   an equally prevalent belief amongst this discord is that meditation  among other things  in consistent practice can help bring us closer to our higher selves  right    so  are we here to have a human experience or to evolve into our higher selves or are we here to overcome the human experience to evolve into our higher selves   i feel like i m starting to categorize souls i know in this dimension life reality as  evolving to higher self  or  here for a full on human experience  which is a little too close to  boys will be boys  for my liking.,2021-11-04 19:31:59

2937,i started doing vipassana meditation in combination with plant medicine occasionally  i don t know if that had anything to do with it  but i noticed that one week i would feel really clear headed and good and the next one i would feel my old self coming back and i experience negative emotions and insecurities  and after a while of that and continuous meditation i would feel really good again  i kind of feel that i m experiencing them to learn from them. is this the path to awakening or is it going to keep going on like this ,2021-07-04 15:25:54

159744,ignore grammar  just venting and not thinking too much. i m a med student in the middle of nowhere. in my 2nd year  away from home where the few little perks that make me happy exist. despite being social  decent looking  and well off  i have never dated anyone in my life. i am bisexual  but recently i think i m more physically  but not romantically  which also drives me crazy  attracted to men. i can t find anyone to date  despite being on apps. i can t find masculine  good looking guys who will actually want to go on a date. i cant control my type and what i m attracted to  i wish i could fuck anything  but i cant.   and the one girl i love is 2000 miles away. she s a friend of mine  who i basically blew my chance with a few years ago. i will never forgive myself. now  she started hanging out with my friends  and flirts with them goes on dates with them. it drives me crazy  i cant study. i feel like a cuck.  on top of that  i m not close with my family  have to study all day  don t have a life because of school. yet being in medical school is all i have to make myself feel like im not a loser. i want a normal life for someone who is my age. i am scared i ll be 35  alone and calling my friends to hang out when they re spending time with their families.  i m in therapy and take antidepresants.,2021-08-22 18:45:03
76577,so as of last week  my sleep schedule has kinda been messed up like i slept at 2pm and woke up at 2am and decided to just have some food and chill for a bit before i sat for studying. i have terrible memory so you ll have to trust me in this one  at around 5 am my mom walks i and tells me i forgot to keep the food container back in the fridge  which i did  and i apologized to her. but then for some reason she didn t stop there she kept telling me things like   you understand sitting in the living room and not studying   you understand talking to your friends   you understand wasting time  and i kinda got angry but i just told her  to please not talk like this to me it was a genuine mistake and for her to go back to her room but she didn t. she continued making these rude remarks about me and i forgot what happened but she started beating my with a container and like pinning me down to the sofa and hitting me till i started bleeding on my leg and she even scratched my hand with her nails and they bled and got bruised  and she never gave a proper answer as to why she beat me at all she just said  oh that s just how i am  i m never going to change  etc etc  and then like yesterday she justified it by saying that since she s undergoing the stress of shifting she got angry at me.  as of recently when i was laughing with my sister about some memes my mom was like  shut up your laugh is annoying  to which i cried and she replied with  i know i m a terrible mother i m sorry you deserve better  in a very sarcastic way these are two out of maybe 11 years worth of the same thing i don t know what to do  she has made fun of me being confused about my sexuality  me drawing  my dreams about going to harvard  my self harm scars but then she says she said them because she was angry. i m 15 as of lately and i genuinely don t know what to do  i ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and my mom just tells me is i eat and sleep on time it ll be fine. she got really angry at me as to why my anxiety didn t change at all and beat me up  again she wasn t even concerned her first instinct was to be mad st me for not improving at all  i don t know anymore.  i m not contemplating suicide just cutting myself again  i am not sure how to handle my home life like it s been really unmotivating  i have exams in two weeks and everything just seems overwhelming.,2020-11-01 07:14:10

7460,when baking soda is added to water  it helps dissolve grease  dirt  and food remnants. instead of scrubbing dirty pots or casserole dishes  soaking the dishes with baking soda can remove everything without requiring any scrubbing  all you have to do is add a couple of spoonfuls of baking soda  fill with water  and allow it to soak for an extended period of time.  additionally  since baking soda is non toxic it s much better for your health and the environment than other cleaners. it can be used to clean in a variety of ways and it s quite inexpensive    last night i made kettle corn which left tons of burned sugar in one of my pots but by morning everything had dissolved and i didn t even need to scrub it  i feel like i ve wasted so much time scrubbing dishes unnecessarily.,2021-09-20 07:00:36
9739,example  first go to your youtube library click view full playlist on the playlist with deleted videos. then you can either use the share button or copy the address because simply right clicking on your playlist from the library will not work as it s only the address of the first video. finally paste said link on the website and voila all videos will show up.   if for some reason it doesn t find the video  i honestly forgot what happens but here s what i remember from memory  it ll prompt you if you want to make a google search. i did this and still didn t find the video but while looking up how to do this one of the tips was if you ever get the youtube videoid  the letters after youtube.com watch v   of said removed video. you just google those letters and i found every single video that the website wasn t able to find either from facebook bot posts  cached searched or websites that had the video embedded. when the website fails and it does the google search it copies the whole youtube video link simply erase youtube.com ... and just leave the videoid and hopefully you ll find your video.   website link  https   quiteaplaylist.com ,2021-11-24 15:30:13
118105,it s been a few months since i ve been feeling this way. there s no real pattern i ve observed but i just feel a general discomfort and discontentment in everything. i m participative when i m out with people but otherwise  i just don t talk to anyone and like to stay by myself. the thought of getting back on instagram gives me anxiety because it s full of happy faces and successful friends and all of that seems so distant. i feel bad i m not them and am stuck in my house with toxic parents. i just feel hopeless all day  have been facing too much rejection and feel unwanted in every aspect. i ve put on weight because i ve stopped keeping a check on my diet and haven t been exercising much. i ve to really really push hard to actively keep myself encouraged. i ve become a bit of an emotional eater and on some days  i don t feel hungry at all. the thought of getting fat like my younger self gives me even more anxiety. and then  there ll be times when i start crying for no particular reason but just the thought that i m going through this with no support and could potentially become suicidal. i feel helpless. what do i do and am i going through mental health issues ,2021-03-28 12:11:34
52690,it s very hard not to fall into depression and anxiety at the moment. was made redundant while in covid lockdown in april  worked out the notice period and have been unemployed for 8 weeks now. my 1 000 person company made 15 20  of staff redundant  nobody knows exactly how many until most people stop working from home .  i ve applied for every position that i m a good candidate for and been rejected 26 times. each application takes 2 3 hours effort and i ve only got an interview twice. most of my former colleagues haven t even had that. my area of expertise is fairly specialised with infrequent opportunities and  although there s a shortage of experience in the country  job opportunities are much more limited since covid. i ve been advised to expect it to take nine months.  i m trying to start a business as away of earning something and to keep busy. no contracts. it s hard for small businesses to see enough value during an economic crisis.   i won t get a lower paid job in my industry because i m too senior   employers expect i wouldn t stay longer than it takes to get a better one. at age 50  they also favour younger workers. unemployment is very large now for unskilled workers.  we don t qualify for government support of any kind because  1  i received a small redundancy of 10 weeks pay   2  we have some savings  mostly for kids education   and  3  my wife has a low paying job. her job now at risk too.  we are burning through the money we have left. will have to ask for a mortgage repayment holiday now  which feels like going backwards and won t help pay other bills or buy food. i m a family man  wife  amp  3 kids  who can t provide for his family  which is hard on my sense of identity. i m there for them in all other ways but can t go forever with no money coming in.   i know how to combat depression  exercise  sleep  diet  thought patterns  etc. it s really hard to maintain motivation. the redundancy process started in feb mar and after so many months of pressure  i m just worn out. i can t see an end in sight and am really scared of losing the house now. i have to avoid it getting me depressed because i will lose all energy to keep doing what i m doing.  what else can i try  is there anything reddit can suggest for lifting my motivation ,2020-07-31 16:53:08

77080,so right now i don t have much. i used to have a lot of stuff in my life. material possessions stopped meaning much to me after my last relationship. i value people and friendship in my life more than anything. i don t have friends anymore. i lost my car. my family treats me like shit now. don t have a cell phone. don t have a job. pretty much any source of joy in my life is stolen before i get a chance to obtain it. at this juncture i m trying the internet as a void to shout into to see if there is anybody else out there. no one hardly shouts back. somebody to make my life still matter somewhat. i wouldn t kill myself even though i think about it a lot. if i had the right supplies i would just walk off and start over somewhere else.  i am pretty nice  but also have been through so much that it s hard to seem like a nice part of society now.  like i ve been around so many hostiles and have seen people try to come at me at times  that i often am holding a knife in my pocket. waiting that i may have to fight for life. does anybody else live like this  like do you see people coming for you then quickly retreat when you notice them   it s not the totality of my stress  but it s a lot of it. i think the worse thing is how people deliberately make me miserable  and they know i don t deserve it. i m pretty sure they could stop  but they don t.  i ve never been a bad guy. i don t understand why my life is like this. is there anybody out there left to live this for ,2020-11-03 04:42:36

49602,to me depression means the dismissal of logic in favour of supporting your own self loathing. everyone knows what they need to maintain and look after themselves  food  water  career  love  hygiene. but we neglect those aspects because in doing so it feeds that negetive opinion of one s self  instead we indulge in self destruction  self negelction and harm or over work ourselves all because we hate that person we ve become. i ve had people who know i suffer with mental heath try to boost me and compliment me but it s the most uncomfortable feeling that literally makes me crease inside and i can t accept it because i m so fixated on self loathing  the most comfortable and natural feeling in the world is to imagine worst case scenarios like i lose my job  get hurt or even die with everyone feeling sorry for me  i hate the situation i m in and i hate myself for being in it.   i d like to know if anyone else feels this way and i m not the only one ,2020-07-19 21:26:25

159780,most people would assume i m a happy person. growing up i was an overachiever  went to college  have a good career at 23  but for some reason beyond me i feel stuck inside my head day in and day out. my headspace consists of seemingly permanent sadness and worry with occasional and very temporary stints of peace and i don t know how to fix it. it s gotten to the point that dark thoughts i never thought i d experience are occurring more and more. i just feel like from the outside looking in i seem happy  and i know that there are many people that would kill to have the opportunities that i have had  but i can t keep pretending that i m not fucked up inside.   ive been struggling with my mental health for about three years now  and i ve yet to talk to anyone about it because at the end of the day  i know that people really don t give a fuck about what others have going on and i understand that to a certain degree  but at the same time i can t keep living like this and faking it. something has to give.,2021-08-22 21:32:43

149138,i didn t fucking ask to be here  but now i m here  and people love me  and they ll be devastated if i leave  and i can t do that to them. when i m around other people  i feel ok anyway. so fine  ok  i won t kill myself. i ll do it just for you  loved ones  even though living is misery every second of every day  i have no spark inside and i just want to sleep. but i ll get out of bed  just for you  to make you happy.   but..... society keeps society ing  doesn t it   i can t just  stick around  for your sake. i have to actively    work   . i have to    work hard   . and i have to    work hard in the way that society wants me to   . can t just be a part time barista  oh no. that s embarrassing and also i ll be homeless within a month. no  i have to study and internship and make something of myself. and even then     i better study the right thing   . because we only appreciate certain kinds of hard work around here.   but i don t fucking want to live let alone work to live. is this a joke  i hate myself. i hate society. i hate being here and i don t fucking want to be here   i m only here because it ll make people sad if i leave   but here i am shoveling societies shit because i m not allowed to just exist   fuck off  i hate it     either let me kill myself  or let me simply exist  ,2021-07-16 11:39:44
12258,declutter any items you don t use or wouldn t pay someone to move.  if you re a renter  make sure you still have any original fixtures that you might ve swapped out when you moved in  light fixture  shower head  and assess for any possible damages that you might be able to fix on your own.  if you re a homeowner  it s a great time to tackle those minor repairs  grout that needs replacing  walls that need to be patched or painted  and freshen up any decor.  it s much easier to do these after three to five years compared to ten  twenty five  or fifty  especially the decluttering.,2022-01-30 12:59:42

79975,on one hand it s good  because i can deal with it better. but on the other hand i hate that depression is so entrenched with my life that i know what comes next whenever i have a bad episode. these past couple weeks i ve been going through a pretty bad episode of depression. i felt depressed most of the time these past couple weeks  i ve had trouble falling sleep  and just generally feel hopeless and trapped. usually during the duration of a bad spell of depression  i ll make these resolutions for what i would change in my life to be better  but for one reason or another it doesn t happen  and then i get depressed over not accomplishing said goals. it s a vicious cycle that reminds of me of fat bastard from austin powers being sad because he eats  and eating because he s sad. the past couple days i ve been thinking about deleting most of my social media  because i think the cons of excessive screen time outweigh the benefits. i ve been thinking about trying to eat healthier and exercise more  and do something to try and make friends although i don t know how . that all sounds good  but i have my doubts about myself following through on those things. i hope to god that things are different this time. maybe i ll make friends  maybe i ll get a good job  maybe i will lose weight. maybe i ll become a good student again  if personal life and world circumstances don t upend school. maybe i ll be happy.,2020-11-14 00:28:19

6343,just went to the doctor who wanted to check my feet. he took one look at my hobbit feet and said i was fine  and explained that having hair means the circulation in the area is good  and that the hair will be the first thing to go if the circulation gets worse.   so keep an eye on it  if you notice it thinning or not growing back  talk to your doctor and have your feet checked ,2021-08-19 07:43:29
4918,i know from experience that it s easy to get trapped in a job for years and years all because you love your co workers and feel guilty about leaving for something better. i have actually done this with 2 jobs in the past and i regret all the extra time i wasted where i could ve been making more money or getting a better experience. i know it s hard to leave the co workers you ve known for years  but if it means you will be getting more money or getting more experience in a better career then quit that job and go for something better. i m sure your co workers will want the best for you and in the long run you won t regret it.,2021-07-14 06:39:23
14877,i was thinking tonight of all the times in the past how i would sit there contemplating pulling the trigger and i never did. if i had the chance to go back i would tell myself that nothing gets better. i wish i wasn t a coward. i wish i was able to commit and to stop the hell.   i got so messed up by my ex s constantly telling me i wasn t good enough and that i was ugly in their eyes. i can t even face society now knowing how two people who were so close to me believed that.   i ve tried for years to get a decent job but have never been given a chance. i ve tried a few businesses and they all have failed and i lost everything.   i have no home now. i have no money. i have no car. i literally have nothing to my name and now i live at my parents. i am ashamed. i have tried to get back into dating but as soon as they see real selfies of myself they ghost me. or if i actually open up to someone from them asking serious questions they stop talking to me.   i have zero friends all my life. i ve wanted someone to talk to who actually cared about me.   i actually had good news  i was at the final stretch for a good job that i waited years for.. and then corona virus hit and they decided to get rid of people  so it s off the table.   everything i have tried to do hasn t worked. the words of my ex still ring in my head about me being the most pathetic person she s ever met. she would constantly point out my flaws in my appearance  to prove that another guy in the room was better looking. i tried so hard to build my confidence before her.   i don t know anymore. i ve kept a journal over the past 10 years and read how depressed i was in the past... nothing has ever changed. it s gotten worse. if my parents weren t alive i would have pulled the trigger already. but doesn t it hurt them to have a worthless son. the rest of my family actually made lives. things worked out for them.   i ll probably delete this post and run like the coward i am. i just rather post something to get my thoughts out.,2020-03-19 03:32:31

9742,i ve never really made an official post before  but i figured now is as good a time as any. i was diagnosed with depression at 16 and although i ve made great strides in recovery  some bumps happen along the way and today a really big bump came along. i bombed a test. the first exam for one of my core science classes. i know a lot of people wouldn t really bat an eye at it being the first test and say now they know what the exams look like but it s difficult for me to look at it that way. i don t know how to  learn  what the tests will  be like.  to me they re constantly changing and there s no surefire way to prepare. i ve wanted to be a doctor and help people since i was 8 and i used to be one of the best students in my class. but now that i m in the preliminaries i feel terrible. my gpa  3.2  sucks for med school and i got  kicked out of the honors program my first year because i couldn t maintain a 3.5. my premed advisor who s supposed to motivate and support me straight up said i wasn t an  attractive candidate  and how i should reconsider my life. most days i can ignore all the negative thoughts thanks to therapy  prozac  and a genuine desire to be happy again but this failure really hit me. i did the calculations and even if i were to do perfectly on the remaining three exams  including the final  i d only get a b . my gpa can t handle any more non a s. i just feel so shitty all the time during class and inferior to my other classmates. no matter how much i study or apply myself  it feels like all these other students who are just half assing their way through the course always do better. it feels like no matter how much time i put into it some of my classmates can do everything without have to do anything. i try to learn the information but it becomes hard to follow and no matter how much i study  i just never seem to know the material well enough to answer a question 100  correctly. i try asking questions and talking to the professor but i can never pinpoint what exactly i don t know and even then she doesn t give a concrete explanation. it s just so frustrating because as much as i want to do well  i ve lost motivation to do much of anything for the classes i take since i just can t seem to win. my family loves and supports me which is great but they re so convinced that i m going to become this amazing doctor and that i m so smart when really i m just barely getting by. i don t want to let them down and i want to be able to support a family of my own one day. sure  there are plenty of careers that can do that but how can i do any of them when i m only good at this   even then  i m not very good at it in the first place. please  is there anyone who can give me any kind of advice  i would really really appreciate it.  tl dr   i feel really sucky and i don t know what more i can do,2020-03-01 19:53:12
2990,hi  i am relatively very new to meditation practice and i use the guided meditations audios. it has only been 10  times that i tried it. i had a really nice experience practicing and would like to know if there are people like me out there who have experienced something similar   during my meditations i experience waves of self love that almost leave me teared up. and i believe that is a good thing. but now the feeling of those moments getting expanded and i start giggling and laughing out of joy. has anyone experienced something like that   i love how this is working out for me because one of my intentions of practicing meditation was to get away from my sorrows and fears and just be in the present for a while and keep on increasing that. i think this a way of my inner being to comfort me by making me laugh.,2021-07-06 14:46:29

66818,my dad is an alcoholic. a big alcoholic. he s been to rehab 5 times  and has relapsed all of those times. i ve been living with my dad for about a year now. i have tried to give him leeway and just learn to tolerate it  but  i had enough. at one point  i got so mad about his drinking  i screamed at him  and i ended up spending 2 days at my friend s house. i care about my dad  but his drinking has been the final straw. but  i can t move out. i am jobless right now  and my parents can t take me back because my sister moved back in after she and her husband had a big fight. so  i pretty much have nowhere to go. so  i m stuck. with an alcoholic dad that i can t go anywhere in public with. he embarrasses me  and it destroys my mental health in the process. it s such a humiliating thing when the child has to walk with their father  who is blatently too fucked up to even form a sentence  through a store filled with other people. people glare  and judge you. my mom offered to take me back a couple months ago  but i refused because i had already moved all of my stuff  and settled down. i didn t want to move it all back. i know. shitty excuse. i really wish i took her advice. i cannot stand being around my dad  and i end up just camped out in my room because i cannot stand to be around my dad. his drinking has driven me so close to ending my life. because i truly have nowhere else to go  and i am stuck in a house with a drunken idiot of a father.,2020-09-23 19:59:30
96433,i m ugly  stupid  miserable  socially inept  and so mentally ill that i ruined my last relationship. so why not just escape from my troubles with booze  i m probably en route to becoming an alcoholic. whatever. i think my life is going to end in suicide because that s the only way to end this constant turmoil. i m bipolar and adhd too  which are two conditions which tend to amplify suicidal tendencies. it just seems like i m destined to end my own life.,2021-01-01 13:35:38
3949,hey  i m at such a point in my life where i have some time to talk  but a lot of people seem to have normal busy lives  so it s difficult to bond  especially given the time difference.  i m looking for a fellow adult  sorry for caps   who s open minded towards audio conversations  on an app . it could be entirely anonymous  no video   but i m sadly not huge on texting  hence my preference for voice  which i find to be a more human like medium and experience. i can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have  from my end i would do everything i could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.  general interests  literature  art history  philosophy  psychology  economics  languages  geography.  music  all over the place   seafret  m83  philip glass  lord huron  radiohead  sigur ros  mogwai  of monsters and men  yndi halda  god is an astronaut  godspeed you black emperor  keaton henson  laura marling  max richter  if these trees could talk  clint mansell  some songs of sia and adele  and many other artists. if you don t recognise some of those names  it could be a plus  because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.  literature  non fiction  microhistory  biographies  geography and culture   fiction as in sci fi  mystery  thriller  subtle philosophical supernatural horror. i m more of a prose person  though i do appreciate some poetry from time to time. i might not be really refined for it  i find narratives extremely compelling  especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. i prefer contemporary prose  althought i have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics  mostly  western  sadly   both for school and out of my own curiousity. when it comes to psychology  my horizons were influenced partly by viktor frankl  erich fromm  rollo may  and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. favourite philosophers  i haven t read a lot of primary sources  but i did find reading schopenhauer  sartre  camus  benatar  challenging  in a positive way . philosophically speaking  my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. recently i ve developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti natalism and abortions debate  so if that interests you  we could discuss those.  movies and tv series  haven t seen one in a while  but i used to like black mirror  sherlock  house  futurama  elementary  and a few others. broadly speaking  i like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition  that s why i tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.  i watch quite a lot of youtube  educational  popular science channels  booktube  social commentary  some podcasts. i m quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.  a bit more about me  depression issues and anxiety  a bit socially conservative  do not play any videogames. i m a bit of a bookworm  and i tend to talk about lofty  ivory tower ideas  but some have told me that i do possess a sense of humour  which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments .  i suppose  i m looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. it d be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. i hope i do not sound very entitled  putting forward all these things about the  ideal  person to find on here. my rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection  if any  depending on what you think  after finishing reading my post .  i ve posted this quite a few times  so my sincere apologies to the not first time readers.  thank you for reading this. feel free to pm me.,2021-07-13 22:32:46
2844,i took my cat to get his teeth cleaned last week and they pulled five of them that were decaying. as he recovered from the anesthesia  all i could think about was how much pain he must have been in leading up to the procedure  and how he didn t display any signs of unhappiness. i felt bad. but then i realized that he wasn t hung up on it. he didn t even dwell on it at the time  the pain was simply something he experienced without having secondary emotions attached to it.   i m also inspired by the endless joy of a dog at seeing its owner. there s no bitterness for being left at home. instead  only joy for seeing the person they love.  i aspire to live in the moment and allow negative sensations and feelings to wash over me without being swept away by them.,2021-06-28 22:43:01

129251,i have work today  or games i want to enjoy  things i want to create  but i just can t. i don t feel like this all time but sometimes it just hits me and i have to push off all my assignments and  be nice to myself . i don t want to be nice to myself. i want to get my work done so i can relax. i just have one final left. i got one section done but everything came to a halt. i can t bring myself to finish it.   that s okay  i ll take a break  maybe i can work on my music  but i can t do that either. maybe i ll open up my daw and listen to my current project. i ll listen to it over and over again recalling that time a few months ago when i could do anything.   that s okay  i ll play a game instead  but i can t do that either. none of my hundreds of options sound fun. i am paralyzed by choice. i remember how i couldn t get passed that level. or how i kept losing matches. maybe i ll open a more casual game a get bored after 5 minutes.   that s okay  i ll watch youtube . i mindlessly skip the most engaging videos in favor of shitty compilations or even just spend most of my time trying to find a video that can give me a pinch of seratonin.  i devolve to reddit. i scroll mindlessly again. i feel worse by the minute as i upvote mildly interesting posts and scoff at mediocre memes. i have a snap of clarity but just remember my responsibilities and let myself drown in the scrolling again.  i remember that i shouldnt be on my phone so much. but what else can i do  i end up just laying on the floor. just blankly staring at the carpet. my mind just keeps sinking deeper and deeper into stale misery.  i finally get to that place.  i wish i was dead . i brush past it since i ve thought that thousands of times before.  i sigh and get up. maybe i ll get sometime to eat. maybe i take a walk. sometimes it helps  sometimes it doesn t. maybe i let myself watch youtube the rest of the day. maybe i actually force myself to get more work done. maybe i just pass around my house until it s too late to do anything  even though it s only 4pm .   this time i started writing this post. my therapist told me to reach out to these kinds of communities.  sure  why not . i ve been thinking about getting anti depressants  it s about time . i told my family and they were worried. i hate it when they re worried about me  shit is that a bad thing to think . sometime i feel like i m making progress. yesterday was pretty good. maybe i ll go take a walk and get a snack. maybe it ll work this time. maybe i ll stare at the wallpaper on my computer  the new york skyline. maybe i ll name the 5 biggest buildings. maybe that ll make me feel smart  like i have value. maybe i ll remember how prentenious i am. this post it s self is all poetic and shit. maybe i ll acknowledge that i m a decent writer.   i sigh. i think i ll take a walk and maybe eat something. my legs won t move but i know they can. i guess i gotta stop writing this first. i think i ll come back later and read your generic replies. maybe this time it ll feel kinda good to know there s other people who feel the same way. maybe i ll break the cycle this time and finish my essay...maybe lol.,2021-05-07 14:46:42
7423,hi     i m hailey  im feeling kinda lonely and want some people to talk to and someone to keep me company  we can talk about anything    even if you just want someone to talk to about your day or something i d he happy to listen  my general interests are all over my profile but i ll list them here too  i like anime  my favourite is hunter x hunter and i m currently watching bleach  i m only on like episode 73 so please no spoilers if you ve watched it  i enjoy video games  my favourites are the last of us one and two. while i own a ps4 i play on my xbox one more than anything  my current most played game is probably apex legends  i also love music and am open to more recommendations  if i seem interesting or your kinda person please feel free to dm  i also have discord and snapchat if you wanna talk elsewhere  looking forward to hearing from someone   ,2021-10-21 08:22:14
106940,i am so emotionally tapped out. i m tired of remote learning and dealing with my kids bickering  keeping up the house  a husband that is just completely detached from it all and has headphones on all the time. my son has decided he doesn t want to do anything more for his adhd and apparently his 9 year old self will just figure it out   fine  whatever. my daughter is a fucking jerk that fights me over everything and throws a fit when i tell her to shut off youtube and do her work. the kids go into school two days a week and that got cancelled this week because of snow and i m just... done. part of me just wants to wander off into this snowstorm and go freeze to death in the woods or something. i just need a break and i m never going to get it because there s no family nearby and no one s going to help me. i ve been battling depression and anxiety for so long  gone through so many meds  and i hate that so much of my sanity is dependent on getting away from the kids. i hate that i have to drug myself to sleep and that typing this is painful because i gnawed all my nails off again. if i do have nails i just pick at myself and i m so tired of being broken yet expected to hold all the shit together.  sorry about the rambling  just having a self pity session before the sleeping med kicks in. thanks for reading my rambling.,2021-02-01 23:25:33
8087,pregnancy can be an anxious time for a woman and her partner. leave it to their doctor or midwife to explain  the risks.     to be clear  i don t endorse treating people who have experienced a miscarriage like nothing happened. the loss of an unborn child is devastating and anyone who has gone through  that should be allowed to fully grieve.      obviously there will be exceptions to this rule because life and relationships are complicated  but try to be mindful.,2021-10-08 08:20:18

25839,i m 28 years old now and in the summer of 2018 i overdosed on heroin fetanyl and nearly died. when i overdosed i was laying on my back and was choking and regurgitating on my own vomit. luckily my girlfriend  at the time  was there and called 911. unfortunately  she waited a decent amount of time to do so but i m not going to go into that. i ended up being put into a medicinally induced coma and life support for 8 days. the doctors asked my girlfriend if my parents were still around just in case they would have to pull the plug on life support. thankfully i pulled through. ever since then i ve had serious memory issues. amnesia actually. i remember almost everything from my  previous life  but i ve had absolutely enormous trouble remembering the most menial things. it is frightening. for example  if i walk into a building and get directed to where the bathroom is i will have trouble remembering how to get back to the entrance of the building. out of all the things i deal with i think my complete loss of direction and orientation is the most frustrating scary. i almost feel like i have dementia and get embarrassed asking the people the same question multiple times. when they tell me that i ve already asked that  it makes me want to just shut down and not say anything to anyone in fear of me just repeating myself and them thinking i m stupid or just some weirdo. i always forget what day it is. i used to remember peoples names  but nowadays you can absolutely forget that. i m ocd with where i put things back  but i never remember putting stuff back and have to check over and over to make sure i put it back. my social life has gone to absolute shit. my brimming confidence at one point has been shot to nearly nothing and its hard for me to articulate myself and carry on a conversation nonetheless talk about anything in relation with anybody besides lifting weights and women. i researched more about my situation online and there are other reported cases but very few. there was a vice documentary on a kid who suffered an overdose and has the same thing as me. but in all honesty  i think mine is even worse than his. i just needed to get this off my chest. i don t really what else to do. i think about suicide quite often but don t really think i could ever do that for multiple reasons. i seriously need help but don t know what to do. thanks for listening all the way if you read this far. appreciate it and much love.,2020-04-28 17:26:11
113614,starting a new day is so hard for me  i don t know how people wake up ready for another day like nothing. it s so hard to realize life is still the same. i usually force myself to sleep as much as i can so the day seems shorter  even pretending to be asleep so my family won t bother me. just how can people wake up happy    ,2021-02-27 00:42:01
196612,how bad is it if even the most simple things that normally bring me joy are painful. i play guitar and practicing is like torture. also when do i tell my parents that i think i have depression and i find that life is pointless  futile  wasteful just to exist in. why should i work a 9 to 5 just to go home and repeat for the rest of my life ,2022-01-04 03:01:38
5410,idk how to start   i had a therapy session today  i ve been in therapy for the past 2 years now  and the recent sessions all felt weird and i can t point my finger as to why that s the case.   now  i have avoidant personality disorder so i m a really insecure person  who is really sensitive to how other people communicate non verbally with me.  i don t know why but i get the feeling that my therapist is annoyed by me.   at first i thought it was because i was being stubborn on some things like starting sports or getting a doc appointment etc. but i did almost all of the homework i get and i try to be enthusiastic about therapy.    and she doesn t outright give me verbal statements that d give me proof i m not crazy. but it s just a hunch  and i ve never gotten it from her before.   it upsets me so much  i ve had a tight throat for almost 2 hours because i was so close to crying but i tried not to brcause she didn t give me an outright reason to feel this way.   i thought maybe i m just really depressed and sensitive recently because of the stress but i ve had worse times and never got that feeling from her.   it s like she tries to finish the topics too quickly and that s why i stopped talking too much about anything whenever i notice this because i m scared of annoying her   so the recent sessions i ve felt more and more upset and i didn t adress this because i don t want to accuse her of anything. maybe it s my fault  maybe i complain too much or i am really annoying   i just noticed my insecurities are really bad recently  also with other people  so maybe that s that.    idk why it makes me feel like crying  it was like my safe space and i don t even feel comfortable talking there anymore,2020-02-17 20:51:00
157779,i m 16 and i am really sad every day and nobody knows. it all really started when my  friends  from my school bullied me and then i often skipped school. i never let it show  but then i cried at home and suddenly got very bad grades  even though i was actually a very good student at one point. the teachers noticed what was strange and i said that everything was ok. now then came the lockdown and i had better grades again and since then i have not lived properly anymore. i always try to behave  normally . simply everything is played. just everything. i try to fool myself and imagine that i am happy every day. i have trauma or something. i just always feel bad since 2 years. i do not know what i want. well just all sad. the only thing that sometimes makes me smile at night is the thought of how much fun i used to have in life. it feels like my head is about to explode. i wanna scream  til it s all out i can not anymore,2021-08-15 20:18:41
110895,every day i just try to find a reason to live and to be honest i haven t found yet . i m sad most of the time and i don t want to do stuff anymore all i do is sleep and lately it s affecting me . i feel like loosing control over me   like i need to laugh or maybe be angry but i just sit there emotionally staring at things . i get lost staring at things   can t sleep without listening to someone talking   nights are the worst   i don t remember what i do at nights anymore . my memory is fading day by day and all i want is to find solace in things so i start doing a new thing and stop doing it mid way and take up a new thing and contemplate over not completing the first thing . i m terribly upset about stuff and always think about ending it all   this is frustrating and i don t even have the sheer willpower to kill myself . i want friends so bad but i don t want to be a hassle in their growth yet i want to be a part of their growth   all i just feel is gravity and blood flowing through me . i used to watch porn and anime just to keep me busy and now even this all has no affect on me . i am just a waste of space with no purpose or ambition . i am emotionless and satisfied to an extent . this is boring i want to end this boring life   i want to be desperate about stuff . i don t like it here   lately i stare ceiling in the dark listen to some old 1930s songs because they feel like commentary   i need human interaction and touch i need to have sex i need to have a reason to get out lf bed   i don t want to be this what i am right now but i cannot help it i don t have a strong reason or respect fpr me anymore . i feel like a lost cause  ,2021-02-18 13:47:27

43846,i think it all went down in sophomore year of high school. freshmen year my best friend introduced me to one of his new friends and we were all best friends it was great. wed ride bikes around and hang out all the time and eventually the new friends mom started buying us beers and vidka and stuff so we could all party at his place on the weekends. this was hands down the best part of my life this far i just felt genuine we were always laughing and we had a tight knit group.  i stayed like the whole summer at this kids house and smoked weed tripped acid got drunk all that fun stuff. his mom would often call me her third son and she was seriously my favorite person  always knew how to have a good time and was always there for anyone. we missed and kind of ignored obvious signs that she was in a downwards spiral and one day she shot herself.   when i got the news i was getting off work and my oarents were out of town so my neighbor came and picked me up. i remember holding back tears passing their neughborhood on the way home and thinking that id be able to let it out when i got home.  when i finally did get home i couldnt cry. i wanted to  but nothing would come out i just felt numb at that point. i thought about all the great times we had  all the times she cheered me up  how welcome she made me feel in her home  and how none of that would ever happen again and i still couldnt cry.  we all got together the next day to mourn together and it just turned into all of us fucking around and ignoring it.   a few months after that i picked up acid again but went way harder with it. i was tripping almost every weekend just fighting off the negative thoughts and trying to enjoy myself but after every trip i felt less myself until i conpletely forgot who i even was.  i soent that whole year just tripping on anything i could find and smoking weed all day every day. i started feeling weird around my homies and found a new friend group only to find i felt the same way and would often just silently sit and give one worded responses. i dont know why anyone wanted to hang out with me  i even got an amazing girlfriend that year somehow but i just felt fake as hell even though i wasnt even saying anything.  junior year things got a little better but eventually i heard my parents talking shit to their friends and the next day threw a temper tantrum like a toddler and punched a door so naturally my mom had the cops pick me up and spend fuve days in jail. after that i was gifted with months of hearing how threatening i was and having adults yell at me all the time and have a therapist tell me id probably end up sucking dick for drug money or whoring myself to old men.   i dropped out and im doing an electrical apprenticeship rn  got a place with a good friend  but i still feel fucked up and i think thats probably where its from  thank you for listening to my ted talk,2020-06-29 20:03:10
4534,hi  i have been practicing meditation on and off for several years. i have been consistent when i needed it the most and practiced less often when i felt better... bad approach i know. in many ways i think meditation made me a better human being but there are still aspects of my character that i haven t been able to address. one thing specifically bothers me a great deal  when i lose patience with beloved ones i can say truly nasty things  things i regret almost immediately. in the heat of the moment i struggle to observe and control my negative emotions. it doesn t happen often but when it does i feel miserable because i don t want to inflict pain to the people i care the most  it also makes me sad that i have this unpleasant side. rationally  i know that i shouldn t behave like that and i am frustrated that sometimes i can t let go. is there a specific form of meditation that could help with this  i practiced metta in the past with mixed results. i am genuinely open to suggestions and recommendations. thank you.,2021-10-03 06:46:16
163044,i really think i could benefit from a 1 14 day stay somewhere else. i m struggling so much in my mind  but i m making the basic things happen to keep my family afloat. like  i m functioning but it s eating me alive. it s taking all of my energy to make sure my kids hair is brushed and i survive my workday but there s nothing left. i have a great support system but they have no idea that they should be supporting me because i do not externalize my depression symptoms  even tho it would be nice so someone would actually believe me . anyone have experience with voluntary stays   or do you feel that you really need some interference even tho things look okay on the outside  how would i explain a hospital stay  do i need one    and i m constantly questioning myself second guessing . am i exaggerating my need for help or do i actually need it   this confused momma will be grateful for anyone that reads this  points me in the right direction  or just maybe has some advice to share.,2021-09-03 23:37:51
179335,i m not sure i was ever really  alive . just kind of a walking battery keeping myself alive to do basic functions like breathe  walk  talk  eat  etc. i ve never really had much cause or reason to be alive either. i don t know who my father is  my mother died when i was 10 and i was put through five different foster homes as a result of abuse  and i ve only ever worked at walmart. i never even finished high school. had to drop out because i was going to be 18 and would have nowhere to live  so i had to work as much as possible to earn as much money as possible. and even during high school  i never did things like go on field trips or prom or anything like that.  even now i m just living in a bare apartment. just my bed  a lamp and my laptop and phone in my bedroom and bare necessities of food in the fridge and freezer. nothing else. i just go about my day at work minding my own business  put in my 8 hours  and come back home. no one bothers me  i don t bother them. works out okay. if you looked at me  you d know there s nothing to me except a shell. just nothing.  you d think i d want to change things and actually have some semblance of happiness and meaning  but i don t really know what that means or how to do that. but  if i m going to take some form of control over my life  i might as well start by ending it. i went to a local gun store and just got a handgun. i would have asked for just one bullet but they d probably get suspicious of me.  i ll probably do it today since i m off. no better time. this is all i wanted to say. bye i guess.   hannah  25,2021-11-01 12:38:35

2633,you tell yourself to start working on it for at least 5 minutes  after that you can stop whenever you want. note you don t  have  to stop.  starting something is the hardest part  when you already started working it s easier to keep on going. often you don t even realize 5 minutes have past already.  i gotta add  this trick doesn t work for everybody. but it worked wonders for me.,2021-05-13 08:07:19

144710,so  i ll start this by saying that i ve had attendance issues in school for as long as i can remember due to my horrible depression and anxiety and this year i decided to finally drop out because im 16 and i legally can now  and my school stopped offering any of the little support they did as soon as i turned 16 and they legally didnt have to keep me in school anymore. dropping out if school was honestly a good decision  i have felt so much better  but now my mom expects me to get a job.  i ve applied places  and i vehad an interview but wasnt hired  but i just cant see myself ever working because most of the time i can just barely keep myself alive  i dont know how i m ever going to deal with an actual job and having to wake up and work every single day for probably the rest of my life.i already feel drained just thinking about it  i only have so much energy and i use most of it to keep myself just alive  i dont know if i can deal with other responsibilities. any this all just makes me feel even worse  because so many other people are able to graduate school  get a job  but i just cant. i even had another interview recently but i broke down crying at home instead of going. i am unfit to work but my mom expects me to since i m not in school and i dont know what to do.,2021-06-30 12:15:39
1789,i feel like for my whole life l  everytime i have something to look forward to  no matter how big or small  it gets ruined. it s like there s some all powerful force in the universe set on keeping me unhappy.  i don t think i can take anymore let downs but i m too scared to kill myself. i feel like i m stuck in a perpetual pattern of disappointment and sadness.  i thought everything was going to get better  i crawled out of my depression and lived briefly in the freedom of joy. it. it wasn t long before nothing besides myself dragged me back into my pit of self loathing.  the only reason i m still alive is because i m scared of the effect my suicide will have on my loved ones. that thought alone is a realization that my life is so fucking meaningless. i ve had loved ones who took their own life and i know how much it hurts  but you move on. just like people would move on from my death. truthfully the only reason i m still alive is because i m a coward.,2020-02-06 16:45:24

4917,don t suffer the same fate as i did  gum disease is a silent killer that is too light to be concerned about until it is too late to be reversed.   a common early warning sign is gum bleeding but to most people  and even many dentists   gum bleeding is a tiny issue or nonconcern. wrong   see... for a decade  or longer   my gums would occasionally bleed during brushing. my family dentist had never flagged this as a major concern. during  routine visits  he would occasionally comment  oh your gums are a little weak.. just take note to floss that area.    it was only recently that i visited a periodontist for an issue  a shifting tooth  that required specialist attention. i was diagnosed of a late stage gum disease  periodontitis  resulting in the shifting toot due to bone loss  because left untreated  the disease eats away at the bones little by little... .  i did a deep scaling and cleaning treatment and bone graft treatment which halted the progress of the disease.   unfortunately  the effects of the disease  a shifted tooth resulting from bone loss  was unreversible. regrettably  this could have been avoided had i not ignored the bleeding gum warning and went to a periodontist for a second opinion.  in the words of my periodontist   there is no such thing as weak gums... you either have healthy  non bleeding  gums or a diseased  bleedy  gums.   after the periodontic treatment  my gums no longer bleed even under the hardestof brushing so i strongly urge you to consult a peridontist if you experience that occasional gum bleeding. don t wait till it s too late ,2021-07-14 05:39:40

94602,it s over a girl  she s cool and we ve talked a few times and i m pretty sure i m over attached to her like crazy. i still can t help it but looking and when i tell myself no to stop and get myself back in order i somehow see her on places i don t even follow her on like reddit.  i had this panic attack for the silliest reason ever  this case being a friend she made  he s a funny guy and i like him and all but in the back of my head i m thinking the worst and that i just lost my shot. i don t know why i m so shaken up by this but this whole circumstance has got me feeling down for quite some time honestly  i genuinely feel like i m addicted to her and i rarely get my fix. it sends everything else into a downward spiral and i don t know why  she s special but if i were to be realistic no one should be able to make me feel this bad because i feel good around them. i m in such a terrible spot i really just don t know what to do.,2020-12-27 08:23:45
134491,in a society where so many of my most progressive friend groups claim to be sensitive to mental health and depression  i feel like they just don t get it and i m happy for them that they don t but please just stop. stop suggesting what to do to feel better  stop giving me cool remedies and schedules for self care. i didn t ask you for a solution  i only asked for companionship. stop trying to fix something you can t understand because it only makes me feel worse that those things don t make me feel better because you think they re full proof or worse that i am just lazy or not doing enough for myself if i don t do them.,2021-05-24 21:09:13
5091,you don t have to restart the computer everytime a program crashes. use task manager  ctrl shift esc  to kill the process. for example if outlook crashes then go to outlook in task manager and select end task.  if task manager doesn t open  you can kill all processes by pressing  ctrl alt delete  and click on  sign out . sign back in and boom you have clean pc with all the processes shut down. but note  all your unsaved work will be deleted  and  all the updates and installations going on or processes may go corrupt . so use it carefully.  if neither of these 2 work then do force shut down by pressing the power button for 3 5 seconds. but again all your unsaved work will get lost and installations might get corrupted.,2021-07-19 03:00:39
275,have you ever tried meditation while being out of breath  i did this the other day and found it pretty interesting. your breath comes as a very natural point of focus and since your system is trying to get a lot of air into your lungs on itself   it feels like it s much easier to become aware of the breathing without controlling it.  what do you think    is this in any way a known practice  ,2021-02-14 18:54:06

6378,i ve been meditating almost every morning for a couple of months. i know the benefits take a while to manifest  but one clear trend so far is that when i miss a day  that day goes poorly.  have i developed a tolerance  the same way a coffee drinker must drink coffee each morning to maintain their usual alertness ,2022-01-25 18:36:25
55701,this whole world sucks. we all know were going to die and everyone we love. we stress and scratch and claw to earn a living wage. the ideas of jobs suck. jobs are a man made creation and side effect of modern society. we have no tribes  no communities  no purpose. all of social media is fake and an angle to make money or sell something. i m constantly anxious. there is no god. this is just a pointless blip of time that i ll be here then i ll be dead and gone and forgotten probably with a lot of suffering along the way. all for what  people have their heads in the sand. i m judged on my occupation  that would replace all of us in a week if we died. humans are greedy and power hungry and vain and selfish  why am i supposed to believe life is inherently good  why am i supposed to believe people are inherently good  any look at history shows what evil and cruelty we re capable of. those people are no different than you and i. i don t want kids  i don t want a bullshit perfect picked fence marriage where both parties grow old and tired of eachothers shit fantasizing about fucking other humans bc we are not a monogamous species. what am i gonna do  work a job i hate  even if it was the best job in the world  doing anything day in and day out sucks eventually  to support a life that is riddled with anxiety and depression and suffering  all to retire and die  and i m supposed to believe life is a blessing and be grateful for it    humans evolved in tribes  with deep belief systems in a higher power  and a deep connection to eachother all coexisting in a tribe in nature. modern society is like putting a lion in a cage and giving it unlimited food everyday at noon and then asking why it is sad with glazed over eyes.  wtf  lion  you have all your needs met  and a cozy comfortable life  why are you so anxious and depressed   because the lion isnt in its home  humans are not in their homes. fuck.,2020-08-11 23:30:33

69074,man i hate when people tell me to be happy. what is there really to be happy about for a person like me. yes i know i love a roof over my head  clothes to wear  and food to eat but that s a given and i m grateful for that. im a 15 year old and my life is really a sad mess. my grades are horrible. i have really no motivation to do anything anymore and i just sit in my room and watch netflix all day. it s not like i have a girlfriend to love and look forward to being with. i barely have friends where i am because i just recently moved here... away from all my true friends and family . i don t even have a job that could keep me occupied or give me some money for myself. i go to my terrible school everyday  do work i have no motivation to do. then i come home and sit till i repeat it all over again the next day. i m even gaining some weight and it s not like i can even go to a gym to keep busy because of this covid shit. i can go on and on but really... what is there to be happy about in life  life is just a boring repetitive messand to top it off  life gets even worse and harder as time passes. i feel like i ll finally reach happiness when i have a wife  maybe some kids  and am financially stable enough where i don t have to worry about much. that s just me though. everyone s definition of happiness is different. anyone else feel similar to this ,2020-10-03 00:27:24
151158,hello  it s a rather long story  basically my whole life and how my parents  behavior and little comments affected my decisions in life and make me really  really sad.  i am 20yo at the moment  female  but have been struggling with suicidal thoughts since i was 13. i am not diagnosed with depression  haven t been able to go the psychotherapy  because my parents think i am joking and it s over exaggerated.   back in 2014  when i was hitting puberty  i had an awful summer where i realized everything is meaningless and whatever i do in my life is going to be forgotten and had my  nihilistic  phase  crying all day that i am useless  i have no friends  no one to understand me  nothing. it was rather unusual  because my mom has given me love all my life  my father was a bit on the cold side  as he stopped expressing love towards me once i started growing up and decided to raise me up as a boy and not spoil me. all in all  my 2014 summer was pretty sad  i told my mom about it and that i wanted to see a psychiatrist  because i didn t feel too well  but she brushed it off with   if you go to the psychiatrist at 13 you are going to become insane at 30    its a stigma in my country to seek help from a professional about your mental health.   during the years after that i grew out of this nihilistic phase  decided that even though everything is meaningless  you can still enjoy the good things in life. i still had my episodes of wanting to kill myself  end it all  being unbothrred with everything  crying over boys  broken hearted and many more occasions. overall  i still had that  it s whatever if i live or die today  and it was getting stronger when i was struggling with love  when it was raining  when my parents put me down for not being the first in maths physics competitions  had different pov from their  wanted to go out with my friends as much as they could  enjoy life  they are basically super strict and didn t allow me lots of things  even when i begged. i was also not allowed to have any boyfriends till 21  no joke here.  ff to 2020  i finally decide to begin a serious relationship with this guy  even keep it in a secret  and love him and enjoy life. i am also studying abroad in the netherlands  first year student so we keep it long distance. it s 2 months into the uni year and i become super homesick for my family and my bf  i am crying all the time  i am also struggling with uni and just can t stand it anymore  to which coronavirus gets out of control and they let us go online so i get back to my country. my parents are happy  i am happy but i am worried how i should tell yhem about my bf and my struggles with uni. they are pretty chill  because i have lots of time till the end of the uni year so even if i struggle i can get better.   ff may 2021  my parents become super toxic  telling me how i should study  spend this amount of time to this course and doing this and that  to which i reply that i will not follow their advice because things are much different than they were 30years ago. they become super oppressive and i decide to run away and leave them a letter in which i say what i feel  that i have a bf and all the things i can t do. i do so  and my mother just stops talking to me so i phone my father and he tells me to come back  sit down and talk with them. i do so  we have a talk with my father and he is pretty chill about the situation  they  let me see  my bf and travel to his town with one thing in mind   that i shall keep studying. i have no problem with that and ff 2 months  they are back on their old shit  telling me that if i dont pass my exams i can never see him  that im not trying as hard as i can  that ill end up as a 7 11 worker  that all im interested in now is only sex and much more things i won t write down. i scream out loud during one fight that i m fed up with all that disrespect and behavior and burst into tears and start shaking  they try comforting me but i doubt that they really understand what s going on in my mind.  today i had an argument with my mother and in the middle of it  when neither me nor her was talking she just commented  or you re gonna tell us that you are going to kill yourself again    like it was a fucking joke and i dont feel that way. i am just done with this shit i am so close to harming myself  i cant stand this anymore  its been every 2 3 days  its like they just cant understand me and just want to obey everything they say. i dont even know if it s just me and my head is exaggarating these situations or they really are causing me mental health problems  im just tired of crying myself to sleep and trying to do my best while it still being not appreciated.,2021-07-23 12:07:50
14849,balled all that shit right up tossed it away to the bottomless  pit...   for real though. same shit different day.  even if there was something different like at this point it s like ight now what. mouse in my wheel chasing my cheese. i m not sure what i have to do to just be able to live life and not care or something idk. i say i m just keep keeping on and am doing good but really . . ugh,2020-03-19 00:42:50
176998,the rumination is tiring but i can t stop. who will i be with  will i have enough money  will i be healthy enough to live alone  who will take care of me if i don t have kids   i probably will not be able to have kids. i don t think i can find a partner   i can t live my life today. i m fixated on the future. fuck this. i can t enjoy anything,2021-10-24 14:28:03
37574,i know  or not  whatever  people post here  but i m just so lost. i have noone to talk to about my problems without feeling guilty  just possibly lost a friend and it s my fault for hurting them  having problems with some people. everything is happening at once and i m anxious and terrified and i just want to crawl in a small cave and die  but i can t escape anywhere. feel so useless read or not read  won t really make a difference,2020-06-07 19:14:51
115920,i hope this is okay. i would have posted a picture of the book  but for obvious reasons that s not allowed in this subreddit. the book is called  undoing depression   2nd edition  and is written by richard o conner.  i ve recently read this book and i found it to be really helpful. the author explains the mechanisms of depression  how he has experienced it personally and with his patients  and gives concrete advice on exercises and things to do. it does in no way claim to be a cure  and i don t think it is either  but it has helped the way i approach my depression and i really think it s worth a read. stay safe.,2021-03-11 14:27:21
5218,i know it sounds stupid  but investing some time to clean up your current device will allow you time to appreciate it more.   as far as speed and capabilities  phones make very small increments with each new version that comes out  camera s being the main exception  though there are others that i m not thinking of .  a new case  screen protector  if yours is roughed up   a new setup  and even cleaning up all the apps you no longer use can make all the difference. you can go from a clunky device to one that runs smoothly again.  i currently have the lg v35. the chipset is not far behind a lot of the more recent smartphones coming out this year. it s 3 years old and i was considering getting a new one  but after making some changes i no longer feel the need. frankly  i don t know if i d notice much of a difference in performance if i were to upgrade  maybe except for screen refresh rate .  i recently reset my phone back to factory and instead of restoring all my saved apps  backgrounds  and widgets from backup i decided to set it up as if i were getting a phone for the first time. i m normally pretty conservative when it comes to my setup  but i decided to toss it all out the window and went through the whole shebang. the amount of apps decreased dramatically making it feel less cluttered and i even changed a bunch of settings from what i normally kept it at.  if you re looking for some additional capabilities you can look into getting a new launcher  not sure if apple has an equivalent  or some other apps that offer additional functionality. i ve been using a pro version of a launcher and some other apps because i liked the additional features they provide apart from the free versions they offer.  i m a little more techy so i even went as far as to root my device and get tasker so that i could customize a lot of the behavior on my phone.  don t root your device if you want to keep your warrantee and you re not afraid to brick your device   and lastly  i took off the old screen protector which was cracked and put a new one on.  after making these changes it feels like a brand new phone ,2021-07-21 21:54:39
30362,i know it may be frowed upon to say stuff like this now  given the current times. but my job is one of the  essentials  so i still have one but since long before this mess there has been a connection between whether im working or not and how bad my depression episodes are. such as 90  of the time when im not working my negative thoughts come rolling in like a flood. and when im working or in a sense sufficiently distracted then it calms down to a more tolerable level. so the solution sounds like i should just keep working or work more to pad out the time  but the sad part is like most people  i hate my job. so this rounds out to if im not distracted than i will be in a constant state of depression episodes. also the answer is no i don t have hobbies and i don t think i can find one because i believe i have a natural disposition to hate things or something like that. any remedies for this  and therapy is not financially feasible.,2020-05-13 19:55:54
136972,hey guys havent posted on here for a while how are you i am not fine i don t see the point to live anymore i am dead inside there is nothing but lonlyness in my life i really wanna kill myself but i don t know why do you have any suggestions ,2021-06-02 20:04:46
42251,i ve never posted anything online before so i ll try to be succinct.  i m 43 male  never married  no kids  on medical leave from my job for depression.  i m so disappointed in the person i ve become.  no matter how much i read or do  it s like i have not gained any wisdom on managing life s challenges.  i grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations.  i was an a student through college but my social skills have always been lacking.  i managed to work for the past 20 years  but i couldn t keep up in my current job  hence the medical leave.     i ve been in therapy for much of the past 10 years.  my psychologist believes i have traits of avoidant personality disorder.  i take several antidepressants and i m currently two weeks into tms therapy.  nothing seems to help.  i m unbelievably critical of myself.  even now  as i write this message  i am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on reddit.   i ve been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written.  i m even more amazed by the responses.  how are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice   i read everything i can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained.  i can t imagine giving advice to someone.  there is so little i can think of to say to people in distress.    i m a mess right now.  i have lost hope of getting better.  i don t exercise  i sleep 14 hours a day.  i have a house but i spend most nights at my parents.  nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me.  the worst thing is that my ex girlfriend cheated on me three years ago and i haven t dated since.  i have some solid friends that i ve known since high school.  they are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own.  i can t seem to learn anything these days.  i used to be smart but i am not longer able to learn new things.   i can t imagine surviving another 40 years.  i think about volunteering but i even tell myself that i have nothing valuable to offer.  i ve no real skills to rely on.  i have saved about  300k in my 20 years of work. i had saved that money so that i could support having a family some day.  i no longer think i m capable of having a family.  too overwhelming.  i would be an awful spouse and father. i don t plan to go back to work.  i plan to just live on my savings as long as i can and then end my life.  by then my parents will be gone and i won t hurt them.  my siblings and friends will be hurt in the near term but they will be ok in the long run.    i ve read so much on coping with this disease.  but so little spurs me to action.  until last year  i m was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going  keeping up with job and social occasions.  the weed stopped working for me though.  now if i smoke  it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse.    thanks for reading all this.  i love you.,2020-06-23 23:41:23
58110,started college recently thinking it would help but it doesn t nothing ever fucking does. i ve been beaten into the ground by life ever since i was born and i can t stand waking up everyday just to feel like shit by the end of it. i don t get it i have friends interests and i m decently smart but none of that shit matters when i ll spend my life wasting away all because of brain chemistry. nothing helps to make me feel better i contemplate suicide daily but i m too pussy to do it. that s the only escape i have and i m too scared. i fucking hate myself every aspect of my from my physical form to my mental and i can t stand being in this body anymore. everyday is fake smiles and a looming sense that everything will come crashing and burning as it has in the past. i say this is it because suicide is unlikely for me but in all other areas my life has ended. i haven t felt enjoyment since i was a young kid all my hope has gone away. i m 19 now and i ve already ruined my fucking life.,2020-08-21 02:10:29
195325,i hate every part of my myself. from my disgusting behaviour to my fucking bitter attitude. i contemplate homicidal thoughts to my family because of how much of a piece of shit i am.  i desperately want to break out of this wretched reality i m in. fuck this.,2021-12-30 06:51:14

155022,whenever i get depressed i really start hating myself. everything about myself as well. the smallest things about myself too. like i cant even put a finger to what i hate about myself i just do. and im angry with myself for no reason too. sometimes i am so angry i would actually do something bad.  i want to stop feeling like that. does anyone have any ideas how i could work on that. i want to be at least neutral about myself. i dont want to go from hating myself to loving myself. i just want to say  eh im kind of okay i guess  instead of  i hate myself and im a horrible person ,2021-08-06 02:58:28
191457,  tw  ed  sh  addiction  sex  mental illness    why is it that when i accomplish something i end up feeling like shit afterwards  i usually dont rant online but i express my feelings without doing something destructive. i ve been in recovery for substance abuse for over 9 months now and while my sobriety has enabled me to accomplish so much  i still cant help but feel like its negatively affected my mental health. when im sober  i fall into a rabbit hole of overthinking and overanalyzing every part of my life. i hate feeling so aware and i just want to use again. of course  i have healthy outlets that get me out of my head but its only so effective.  i just finished my last application to college  and while i should feel proud  its a huge accomplishment  i cant help but feel like shit about it. i couldn t even tell you why i feel this way  i did everything right and i have a good chance of getting into a lot of the schools i applied too. this is just one example  i am incapable of allowing myself to be proud of my accomplishments. i always need to analyze and do better. possibly that stems from my parents unhealthy expectations of me  and now when i am living up to their expectations  its now caused me to set these ridiculously high goals that to any  normal  person would be laughable. i dont even know what my expectations are anymore  i want to go to medical school but i dont think thats unrealistic.  more damaging  is the expectation that i have set for my body. ever since my sobriety  i had the mental capacity to see myself for more than just an addict. i was able to use some of my time to focus on my appearance. i ve always struggled with body image but it was not until recently that i could prioritize it  no matter how unhealthy it would become. i either dont eat the entire day  and then im starving and cant fall asleep because im so hungry  or i eat a lot and then throw it up. i bought a scale  dumbest decision ever  and since i bought it i watch the numbers fluctuate a few digits multiple times a day. why is it that a number can hold so much power in my perception of self  if im 137.2 or 139.4 it makes no difference  but i convince myself that its everything. i hate it. i hate it. i hate it. i m begging for help  but at the same time i dont want to change. my eating disorder becomes so comforting. i have control over something  when historically  my addiction took charge of my decision making.  i live with my dad full time  and he s so clueless. how can this man not notice me vomiting in the bathroom and then crying until i cant cry anymore  i mean  i do block him out of my life  of course he wouldn t notice  he still thinks i m straight.  i hate that i crave attention from older men. have i really reduced myself to that  i would spend hours on grindr looking for someone to fuck me  then i would never talk to them again. i would go to their house  we would have sex  then i would go home  cry  throw up  cry some more  and repeat the cycle. its like im almost asking for it. it took long time  but i have deleted the app  not because i dont want to have sex with older men  but because i m too mentally unstable to have sex period. i ll do it again  i know myself. i m old enough to know these decisions have real consequences. but was i partially at fault when i was raped by someone twice my age  i mean  after all i did go to his house with the intention of having sex. god  that was awful  being held down  not knowing if i was going to get out of there. i put myself in these situations and i dont learn from them.  i really just want to be happy  im tired of putting on a facade. im tired of spending so much time in the morning trying to look good  when inside im so broken. people dont see the bags under my eyes  how can they not see them  i dont sleep  and when i do i cant wake up. i just want to say  and genuinely mean it too that  i m okay.  sorry if that was a lot  no one has to read this either  but i just needed to get my feelings out. thanks   ,2021-12-13 22:29:33
3889,so for months i have been hanging out with a guy  i thought he was an amazing friend and that s all there was too it. i was talking to a different friend and she told me that the guy friend is very interested in me and wants more.  it s really annoyed me because i thought we were just friends and i don t want a relationship with them or to hook up. i don t feel i have led him on but i didn t think it was needed to be upfront and say we re just friends.  he s lovely and nice  i hope he finds someone perfect because he deserves it but it s not me  i wish i felt the same but there is nothing there for me. do i have to address this  can i just continue being friends without making this awkward  what do i do ,2021-07-12 08:52:18

48079,i know what i am about to say will sound dumb  but this is just something that i have to share. a couple days ago my mother was looking for sneakers online  for me  and everything she showed my ugly. honestly. the colors don t even go well in any of these shoes and none of them have shoelaces. my mother said that she likes those shoes and she said that it s a trend to wear these ugly shoes. who the heck would wear something that ugly  anyways  i told my mom that i wanted black and white shoes but she said that that trend is dead. i mean what the heck  i just want to wear something that will satisfy me  not her. i won t even care about what other people think. a few hours ago  i showed my mom a picture of these black and white shoes from a magazine  and then she literally yelled at me and my sister said that when she was my age people would wear that. i don t care if it s not a popular style at all. i don t know why  but i started to cry. my mother looked at me and started to smile and then she covered her smile and started laughing and my sister was bullying me yelling at me calling me dumb for liking that style. my brother was telling them to stop laughing because it was getting worse. when i heard him say that  i started crying even more  because that is the first time he has ever stood up for me. now  my only question is  why do all of these little things matter  why are trends so important  why can t i be myself  i mean i can t be anyone else  because everyone else is taken  and my mother should know that too. can someone please talk to me about  i would really appreciate it.,2020-07-13 23:16:26

10642,warning  this is a wall of text without tldr  let s assume that you have 2 hands  each composed of 5 fingers that you can move separately.  this is useful if you want to count without having anything to write or mark on.  1  count to 30  we are going to use the right hand to count units  the left hand to carry over. of course you can change if you want.  at the beginning the 10 fingers are free  it is the 0.  start counting from 1 to 5 in the order you prefer with your right hand. for me 1 is the thumb  5 is the little finger  and i put the finger in question on the nearest support  the table  a tree  or even my thigh  to distinguish it from the others.  when you reach 5  put the carry with your left hand in the same way as you count the units  so from 1 to 5 by marking the finger concerned  and start again at 1 with the right hand.  you will then have 5 x the left hand   the right hand   the total. so at most 5 x 5   25  plus 5 equals 30.  example  left hand 3 fingers  right hand 4 fingers  makes 3 x 5   15  plus 4 equals 19.  at the beginning to train you can count in your head at the same time  but with a little practice you will go from one finger to the other without thinking and you will only have to total at the end.  2  count to 156  for that you must have on each of your 2 hands an opposable thumb and 4 other fingers composed of 3 phalanges.  you will have 4 x 3   12 segments that you can touch separately with the tip of your thumb  i see you in the background trying .  choose a numbering convention for all these segments  i count the phalanges from the hand to the fingertip  then from the index finger to the little finger.  so the phalanx of my index finger closest to my hand is 1  the tip of my middle finger is 6  the one at the very end of my little finger is 12.  in the same way as before  you are going to use the other hand  the left one for me  to carry over.  at the beginning the 10 fingers are free  it is the 0.  start counting from 1 to 12 by putting the tip of your thumb on the corresponding phalanx.  when you reach 12  on the other hand  the left one for me  point the phalanx corresponding to the carry and start again at 1 with the units hand  the right one for me .  you will have 12 x the left hand   the right hand   the total. so at most 12 x 12   144  plus 12 equals 156.  example  on the left hand i point the last phalanx at the end of my middle finger  on the right hand i point the first phalanx of my index finger  that makes 6 x 12   72  plus 1 equals 73.  hope this helps   ,2021-12-19 10:42:46
108704,i was prescribed new meds last friday. it s valdoxan 25g to be taken daily at night. its side effects are so tough. like  the worst. blurred vision. my eyes keeps getting the glitching things like when your monitor when it s about to be broken. headache. nausea. sickness. dry lip. i can t even walk properly. i called my therapist and he recommended to take half the tablet until i see him again next month.    today was supposed to be my off  but i cancelled it. i put in the shift. i don t want to make my mental illness get in a way with my work. and having the time to actually rest would make me become more depressed as i feel like i m a failure and that my contributions aren t enough.   my symptoms are very different from most people who suffer from depression. no one would notice i m depressed unless i tell them  but still i lost interests to everything i once enjoyed. i have all the desires in the world  but process no motivations at all.    i m neglecting my own mental health to the point in which i m this damaged. i m tired  man. i really am. i know these suicidal thoughts aren t real. i don t want to die. i just want to stop suffering.    but again it seems to be the only way. if i die  it dies with me. i will be no more suffering and finally found my peace.    i m fighting my hardest to overcome it  though. i don t need to beat it. i just need it to be more manageable and i will be fine. i hope today is a good day for all of you. and even if it s bad. i hope it doesn t get worse.    i can t really appreciate myself right now and it will be a hypocrisy for me to tell you all this  but you re worth it  man.    from one useless cunt to another. i hope one day we will just be a cunt.    sending all of loves to you all   ,2021-02-11 07:32:34
120460,but i want nothing more sometimes than to just be alone.   today i had a little of that time after some relationship turmoil that was caused by me and some irritability.   and with that time i decided to journal and i broke down  i realized just how sad i really am all the time  i just never know it because there s other people distracting me from myself.   i can never seem to pinpoint when this sadness started or how long its been lingering   all i know is when it comes it feels like it s always been there  lingering beneath everything else.   all the smiles and happiness and even anger.  i felt those truly i did.   but when this feeling comes  it s deeper than any other feeling i d felt before.   thanks brain and company for helping me for a little while  distracting me  making me feel little bit better or evenfor just masking this deep ache in my chest.   it hurts so much when i realize it s never really left the realization of the shell i ve become.  how much i ve let myself slip away.   even when the intensity of the feeling goes away and the smiles return.   i notice i m not doing the things i should be doing to make myself better   i ve lost all motivation to get better because i ve done it before  i ve gotten better  or so i thought  because it always comes back and it s like all the work i did was pointless  leaving me to feel like a failure and a fraud.   i notice it s much easier for my brain to trick me when others are around  i notice i m instantly different  happier or just irritable  because i don t want to explain.   part of me feels like sadness is weakness.   part of me thinks they won t understand.   part of me thinks i m overreacting or being overly emotional.   but damn this shit hurts      but i ll be fine   i m just tired.   thanks for reading.    ,2021-04-05 03:43:44
188879,i live with my so currently.  our relationship has been pretty rocky  i have relationship anxiety and have obsessively doubted everything about us and have broken up with him a couple times in an effort to get my mental health back together  but we keep ending up back together again . i have also been feeling pretty emotional and get upset over everything and i feel like i ve been dissolving as a person. i feel disconnected from myself  like a blank personality walking around. i ve lost my sense of humor and care for pretty much everything.  my so doesn t really hang out with anyone else or go anywhere  and if he does it s for a short amount of time and they just play cards or something.  he asks me if i want to hang out almost every day  which i appreciate  but most days i have been saying no. i feel pretty guilty about it. and if we do hang out i m just straight up silent and ignore things he says because every time he speaks i feel pressured to respond to things that he says  when he cracks a joke or shares an opinion  etc . i told him why i feel this pressure  i have had family members that would take my quietness personally and get upset if i didn t laugh at their jokes or follow their imaginary script . he said he understand and doesn t need me to reply to things he says but that he does need company a sounding board basically at times or otherwise he ll feel like he s going crazy.    i have told him so much about myself  more than i have anyone else. i would hope he would put the pieces together but i feel like my silence is pushing him away.  would you not feel pretty awkward and pressured if your life in so asked you to hang out every day  i mean i appreciate it but i feel bad saying no when i just cannot bring myself to stay engaged in conversation and when i m drowning in insecurities.,2021-12-04 08:14:47

82530,this is what i learned.  1.  when they lose hope  hope for them.  he told me that it s normal for depressed people to lose hope. but they can draw hope from us  as supporters  when we have hope. when we show that we have hope  it rubs off on them.     2.  capitalize on your  breaks  . this is a marathon. for us sos supporting people with depression  we need to be aware of times when we can relax. self care. we need to tale care of ourselves because our depressed loved ones draw strength from us.   3.  realize you have limits.  this is connected to  2. we re not endless  so we need to pace ourselves if we want to last. realizing we have limits would make us wary of our own health and prevent us from breaking down too.  4.  we have two motivators   external and internal. external motivators are our friends  family  loved ones. internal motivators are our inner goals  objectives.. etc.  depressed people lose their internal motivators . as their sos  we re probably their external motivator  and it s our job to help them find their own internal motivation.    my so has depression  so i created a subreddit support group for supporters of people who have depression   https   www.reddit.com r supporterssupportgrp utm medium android app amp utm source share . let s share our thoughts and experiences there and help each other help our loved ones.,2020-11-21 21:19:36

63996,hi everyone.  i am struggling with depression for some years now. i think i had depressive episodes since i was a kid but the first real breakdown was around 6 years ago.  i somehow managed to get myself going again   or so i thought   but this spring it all crashed down upon me again and i finally saw a psychologist and realised accepted that i am ill.   i am seeing a therapist for some months now  its behavoural therapy  and at first i started to feel better. the last three weeks though were pretty bad again and i wasnt able to stick to the weekplan we worked out. when i told my therapist this  we missed a week in between because her kid was sick  and that i was feeling bad she looked worried and started talking about meds and hospital  because i was  obviously suffering  and not able to stick to the weekplan and therefore participate in the therapy.  although i am not per se opposed to meds i am a bit sceptical. she says therapy can help equally as good as meds but i have to be able to do the exercises. i feel disappointed and let down  first because i feel all in all i am getting a better understanding for my depression and myself  and just because i relapsed a bit for some time that shouldnt mean we cant continue therapy.   and secondly i get why having a weekplan and structure is so important dealing with depression but i am a really chaotic person and sticking to plans has been difficult my entire life. there should be more tools in behavoural therapy to help me besides the weekplan  or at least to help me stick to it  besides just taking meds.  i dont really know what to do. i feel like seeing a psychiatrist and getting meds will lock me in that path  and i am afraid of side effects and i just wanna resort to them if theres no other option.   if someone took the time to read all that  thank you  maybe someone has some experience advice ,2020-09-12 17:19:53

4537,hi  i m not the one to post i m usually just a silent reader but i ve had this question for a really long time. so to make a long post short i ll just go ahead.   right after i was at a yoga retreat the tightness between my brows whenever i meditate got a lot stronger. i had since subdued quite drastically since i came home. but i ve always  seen  stuff when i meditate. some time ago i had intense colors of purple floating around. now they re white and there s a lot of shapes aswell. it s really hard to explain. the shapes usually pulsates and the now white glow is moving with the shapes instead of separate. i have no idea what it is or if it s just my eyes trying to find something to concentrate on.   today i had an intense white light cover my vision  closed eyes  and from the corners darkness crept in and i could make out an eye that later turned into two eyes that blinked at me and disappeared which was followed then by the usual array of colors and pulsating forms. can anyone relate ,2021-10-03 08:35:38

6874,i ve had so many people give me the most amazing songs and i literally still feel like i don t have enough. that or my apple music doesn t play through all my songs enough. but i have over a thousand songs so it s understandable    give me some song suggestions please   don t comment them  message me because it s really hard to keep up with comments and messages. who knows  you might just get a friend in the process as well   ,2021-10-06 23:41:29
5903,for literal years i would hit then 5  10  15 minute sleep timer on my podcast app for hours before finally falling asleep and would toss and turn through the night. i can t remember which podcast mentioned the tip  but i tried it and i ve been falling asleep within 3 or less times pushing that sleep timer and i pretty much sleep through the night now. it s been about a year and half now and i can say it has definitely helped. it s counter to what i want because i actually like the cool air and sheets on my feet over the warm socks  and would prefer to sleep barefoot  but it s a tradeoff for the full night s rest.,2021-08-07 09:11:28
80196, i put a lot of time into this so that those who have trouble understanding can get at least one perspective among many. i ve suffered from depression for most of my life and  while i m not currently suicidal  i have attempted to take my own life in the past. things are a lot easier said than done for people who have to go through this.    my experience in attempted suicide has left me with some advice  it s not worth it. and yes  my life is still as bad as ever.  if not worse  still  it s not worth it.   111 reasons to not commit suicide   1. the people who care about you.  i m all alone. who exactly are we talking about here    2. meeting your soulmate.  i used to believe in that  but it turns out that the things you see in movies and tv usually never happens that way in real life. not everyone gets a happy ending.   3. star gazing.  used to love it when i actually lived somewhere where you could actually see anything. also  it s kinda hard to focus on something like that without having all of your regrets and embarrassments in life suddenly popping up. then you re just left with  why am i even here  why do i have to keep suffering like this  i should just end all of this pain already  there s no point in continuing to suffer like this.    4. astronomy and crazy space shit.  again  used to love it. i was really into this growing up. but depression has a way of stealing happiness away and making things like this dull. it s still exciting to see huge pictures of tons of galaxies and wondering how big the universe really is.. and if there s other life out there. but that excitement quickly fades and ends up leading me to think about how small and insignificant i really am. i mean  i m incredibly small and insignificant on earth  let alone the entire universe.   5. food  i mean... i pretty much spent years eating horribly because i a  wanted to drown out my sorrows and b  wanted to literally eat myself into a heart attack. what i didn t realize is how much physical pain that would end up putting me in  making the suffering even worse and having even less energy than before  which was next to nothing already.   6. going to a friends wedding.  i have no friends. not that they d invite me to a wedding anyway. it s hard enough to get people to stick to something they ve committed to. it s why i nearly made my first suicide attempt on my 30th birthday. my so called friends spent weeks trying to get me hyped up for my first celebration in over a decade  and when the day came i was left completely and utterly alone. i did get a coupon for denny s though  so there s that.   7. music.  i can t enjoy anything i used to. depression brings with it anger and frustration  and the need to escape. where before i could enjoy music and sing to it.. now it s purely an instrument of escape. basically  i only use it to daydream and even daydreaming is exhausting these days. it just doesn t do anything to help besides pass time.   8. concerts.  a mix of the music thing and lack of friends mainly. plus  i don t like having my eardrums being blown out and i have enough trouble getting up to eat  let alone doing everything that s needed to go to a concert i m not really going to enjoy anyway.   9. the people that love you.  of course  wait.. who are we talking about again  someone loves me  i don t even love me.   10. snowball fights.  hahaha  what snow  there s no snow here  just desert. and really bad air. i do like it when it rains though.. or if it s foggy  which is hardly ever.   11. going to the beach.  let s see... when i did have friends and we went  as the lone wolf it was never up to me what we did. it was their time and i was just the third wheel. when i try to go by myself  all i see are couples and people being happy  which makes me envy them and i quickly become sad. it all just deteriorates from there. if only this soul mate thing were real...   12. sunsets.  depression drains the color from the world. not literally  but everything just become more dull to varying degrees. someone may see a sunset and be in awe. me  i look at it  think  meh  it s cool i guess   and then my mind immediately goes to  maybe i d actually enjoy it if i had someone to enjoy it with. maybe if that soulmate thing were real...    13. sunrises.  same as number 12  except that i m not a morning person and the sun burns my skin. just let me sleep in my coffin ok    14. hiking in forests.  i would really love to go hiking. it s the one thing i think i could actually enjoy  even if i m on my own. unfortunately  trying to eat myself to death doesn t agree with that. i m trying to lose weight again  but with being 70lbs overweight and blood pressure so high doctors think the blood pressure cuff is broken  it s just not going to happen right now. let s not forget the aforementioned lack of energy. i m trying though. again. i ll probably fail. again.   15. animals.  dogs are too energetic and needy and most cats are assholes who care about themselves most.. with exceptions. i wouldn t mind a hamster. short lived  because my depression offers anything but stability in life.. and i ve had good bonds with them as a kid  even if they liked to poop on me and pretty much everywhere else they went. seriously  they re like little poop factories. oh well  i m not going to take in an animal unless i can offer it a good life. can t really do that while being homeless.   16. new movies.  yes  because i ve been waiting with bated breath for the 3rd.. 4th.. umm  which complete reboot of spiderman are we on now  i want something that isn t another reboot or superhero movie for starters.   17. old movies.  you know.. i used to be able to sit down and read an entire book.. or spend 8 hours straight doing a puzzle. now  i watch maybe 20 minutes of a movie and switch to a tv show. watch a little of that and then play a game. i can t focus or get immersed into anything these days. best i did recently was i almost got through half a movie in one go. rewatching old movies just makes it worse since i already know what happens.   18. going to the drive in theatre.  no car. also.. no drive in theatres here.   19. walking through local markets.  maybe if i had money and felt like getting the coronavirus would be a good way to shake things up in my life.   20. your favorite artists next song.  back to music are we  this is a mute point. next    21. drawing.  hate it. as in  i hate drawing and painting with a passion. i m in awe of other s being able to do it  but it s not for me. and my attention to other s doing it is very brief before i want to do something else.   22. sculpting your own pottery.  same as drawing. i don t enjoy doing art type stuff. at all.   23. your favorite teacher.  in defense of this one  this list did come from r teenagers  even if it was in r all. i haven t been in school for what.. 16 years now  meh   24. inside jokes with your friends.  why is it assumed that those of us who are suicidal or just suffering from depression anxiety even have friends  some of us are all alone in the world.   25. advice from good people.  i used to occasionally say hi to the cashier at the store  but now i always go through self checkout. only other people i communicate with are on reddit. most of the advice i try to remember is how to raise kids the best way i can.. despite the fact that i ll never have kids because  well  you know about that whole soulmate thing.. if only they actually existed...   26. warm houses on cold days.  homeless. how about a tent  it s definitely better than a few nights ago where i spent the night freezing because i didn t have it. can t close it off to the cold though because the lack of circulation makes it literally rain inside my tent by early morning.   27. bonfires with s mores.  s mores are overrated. i don t care for them  but if i had friends to enjoy a trip with i d definitely be in on it. unfortunately  i have no friends. also  i ll get arrested if i make a bonfire where i m at. also also.. i wanted to take my tent into the woods  but between the california fires and coronavirus  sites near me are shut down indefinitely.   28. reconnecting with old friends.  yeah  no... there s a reason they aren t friends anymore.   29. studying interesting things.  my greatly diminished attention span makes this very difficult.   30. soft plushies.  umm.. no thanks    31. the smell of fresh baked cookies.  love it  being in great pain all the time because i can t stop using them to drown my sorrows  not so much.   32. car meets.  no car. also  it s highly annoying to others when 50 cars roll into a parking lot and start revving their engines and bumping loud music. when i did have my car last  i was living in it and was forced to move from a nice spot way too often because of this.   33. sleepovers.  r teenagers... let s just skip this one.   34. your favorite video games.  just a way to escape. worked for a while  but now they just stress me out more than anything.   35. learning a new language.  so i can speak to my imaginary friend who doesn t speak english  oh  so i can understand people when they re very obviously talking crap about me. it s easy to tell when they suddenly stop speaking english and you find them looking at you quite a bit while laughing.   36. long walks on the beach.  perfect  longer stretches of seeing happy families and couples to make me sad about my own failure at life. times like these have me considering ending it more than anything else.   37. australian beaches.  i live in the us. and i have no money. and i don t fancy fighting off giant spiders or boxing with kangaroos or whatever other things they get up to over there.   38. squishy animals.  why would i want to squish animals  i m depressed  not a psychopath.   39. helping the homeless.  well  if i could help myself i probably wouldn t be homeless. oh  you mean help other homeless  i ve given others my own food many times  even when i m hungry myself. does it help me  not at all. does it make me feel better  no  it doesn t. i just can t stand by when i know someone else is hungry when i can change that. before then summer hit i would make hamburgers on the park grill to feed some fellow homeless and myself something good for a change. canned food start to suck pretty quickly.   40. long hot showers.  love them  but they re horrible for your skin apparently. at least.. i have bad acne breaks out on my chest  back  and shoulders when i take them often. it clears up for the most part when i don t.   41. tea   coffee.  love tea  hate coffee. but tea makes you pee  and i don t want to increase my output when finding a toilet is a lot more difficult when you re homeless. just go outside  no thanks. i respect the community and make sure i don t cause any problems for anyone. that means going into a bottle if needed and dumping it into a toilet later so that the area doesn t smell bad.   42. putting a message in a bottle and throwing into the ocean hoping someone will find it one day.  what s the point if i never find out  besides  i don t litter.   43. helping wounded animals and people.  i tried volunteering at animal shelters and was told they had enough people. i ve helped with some charities though. i just don t have the energy for it right now. i can barely even feed myself some days.   44. accomplishing goals.  my goals are often just being able to wash some clothes or get food water.. simple things. i can barely even get those things done. i ve been so thirsty and unable to force myself to walk 100 meters to the store that i ve actually contemplated drinking my own urine. this isn t about being lazy. this is about having so little energy willpower motivation whatever that you re screaming inside your own head to  just do it  move   but your body just stays there. i m constantly in a battle with myself like this and it s exhausting.   45. cleaning the earth.  i clean the trash in the area i sleep and that s basically it. i don t have the energy to go picking up trash all day  especially when most people care so little about the garbage they leave behind.   46. getting married.  are soulmates a real thing yet  no  ok  moving on...   47. going to see broadway shows.  i had to fix that from brodway  but anyway.. pretty sure the shows are suspended right now due to covid 19. in any case  we don t have that here.   48. the sound of rain.  i like the rain  but try sleeping through that sound while living in a car or tent and you ll quickly grow to hate it too.   49. long car rides.  am i driving  stressful due to other s incompetence and lack if regard for others. as a passenger  i have to have my face in my phone to be occupied with something  which means i get nauseous from looking down.   50. long awesome road trips.  isn t this basically the same as 49  i guess it implies a destination. please don t suggest the beach again.   51. memes.  overused and i don t get every single reference out there  so people using r woooosh to sound smart are annoying. nevertheless  i do tend to get on reddit to pass the time.   52. going to the zoo.  you mean those places that are often inadequate for the animals that live there and are sometimes found to be abusive neglectful towards their animals  i was just reading about how some zoo animals actually commit suicide themselves in those environments. wanna give them a list of reasons not to do it also    53. philosophy.  i think about my past failures and embarrassments enough  thank you. no need to analyze them any further.   54. the smell of old books.  meh. i haven t been in a library in many years and don t intend to change that now.   55. dogs.  too hyper  too needy  too slobbery  stop humping my leg...   56. red pandas.  what about them    57. staying up late with friends.  friends.. what are those again    58. sending letters.  to whom    59. surprise parties.   sigh  never invited to one and have never had one thrown for me. people don t even care enough to say happy birthday.. you know  when i actually did have friends.   60. warm sheets.  i don t get that luxury  being homeless going into winter and all.   61. reading.  reddit. that s about all my attention span is good for anymore.   62. swimming in the pool at night.  some of my depression stems from being overweight  self conscious  and having no confidence. i m not getting into a pool anytime soon. although  i used to love swimming.   63. going to diners with friends.  can you come up with something that doesn t involve nonexistent friends  and going alone is depressing.   64. early morning runs.  i m 70lbs overweight  can barely get up to do anything  in a city with extremely bad air with constant hazardous for health warnings... it s not happening. i tried to in a gym not long ago and i m almost positive i had a heart attack. my balance was the last thing to come back and that took a while. when i was younger i got blackout drunk once and had far greater balance than that.   65. looking at old photos.  i have none  unless you mean the couple when i was still depressed all those years ago and i just want to go back in time and tell them  do it  do it now  things are only going to get far  far worse than they are now where happiness will be a myth. and soulmates. those aren t real either.   66. going to a museum.  boring. sorry  i usually like them for the most part  but my city doesn t have one worth going to.   67. soft sweaters.  meh. i m not really a sweater person.   68. being in a hot jacuzzi at night.  all by myself.. because that s very comforting. no thanks  i ll just take a hot shower and burn my skin.   69. going to the aquarium.  maybe if i had someone to go with. i ll just watch a video otherwise.   70. hugs.  i want these so much  you have no idea. now this would be something worth living for if i actually got any. like ever. i did once a few years ago and it was the best thing to happen to me in a very long time.   71. fireplace.  combined with hugs that don t exist and a soulmate who doesn t exist.. i would actually be happy for a change.   72. holidays.  i spent many years completely alone for holidays. i m more annoyed with them than anything.   73. home cooked meals.  when i have the energy to cook  i love them.. but that isn t gonna happen while i m homeless.   74. roller coasters.  doesn t mix well with high blood pressure  trust me.   75. going to parties.  can t you tell by now i m super fun at parties    76. playing pranks on people.  not really my thing. pass.   77. driving your dream car.  i don t have one  i m not really into cars. i suppose if i had a nice rv to live in that d be really great.   78. getting the job you wished for.  something that won t work me to the point of injury and leave me homeless would be a nice start. i would love to have to energy and capacity to help other who suffer as i do. unfortunately  i can t even help myself right now.   79. seeing your favorite animal in person.  dolphins. would be cool. what if they don t like me though  why would they  i don t even like me.   80. camping.  doing plenty of that right now  being homeless and all.   81. sleeping.  used to sleep in all the time. i hate it now. i love dreaming  but i don t like sleeping in anymore. it s the only peace i get though. well  except for the fact that soulmates actually exist in my dreams and then i have to wake up and face reality.   82. iced drinks on hot days.  a luxury in my case. they are nice though. not worth continuing to suffer through this miserable life i m living though.   83. poetry.  ick   84. trying on cool clothes.  i m cool with just cargo pants  thank you.   85. hanging out with friends.  i dunno how to indicate that i just moaned for a long time here. maybe  nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngh... but a lot longer than that.   86. city skylines.  don t have that here.   87. trying out future technology.  is it the future yet    88. beautiful wildlife.  i still like this. would need to get out there to actually see it though. would still be a boring day without more to do or someone to share it with.   89. collecting things.  i collect past regrets and embarrassing moments of myself. it s useless.   90. making someones day.  i like to do this. wish someone would do this for me for once though.   91. laughing so hard you can t breath.  my face always hurts just from smiling when i m watching something funny. you aren t likely gonna get me to laugh very much. certainly not enough to make me unable to breathe.   92. warm blankets fresh from the dryer.  wasn t this already listed  hmmm... ah.  60. warm sheets. are you even trying at this point    93. sewing.  let me ask that again.. are you even trying at this point    94. seeing the future.  you must ve seen that i d ask  are you even trying at this point.   95. late night convos.  with who   whom  bleh  whatever  i ll just talk to myself like usual.   96. rewatching your favorite shows.  another reused one said differently.  17. same answer basically. there s only so many time you can rewatch something though. i feel like i m just cycling through them over and over.   97. hunting.  used to like fishing. both offer toi much time to think about bad stuff unless i can occupy myself with something else  with defeats the purpose.   98. boardgames.  i ve played enough board card games with myself to know it isn t fun.   99. sitting out in the rain.  sure  if i wanna freeze to death. hmm... maybe we re onto something here.   100. the sauna.  hot shower   101. cooking new recipes.  i do occasionally when i m able to actually cook.   102. bob ross tutorials.  i hate doing art  remember    103. gordon ramsay s cooking tutorials.  yell at people  it s fucking raw   and use various insults. sure  i ll give you this one.   104. climbing mountains.  afraid of heights and i m 100  sure that if i don t fall  i ll just toss myself off anyway. good suggestion.   105. old architecture.  no thanks.   106. reading books.  bruh... ok what number  61.. this is almost like those employment tests that keep asking the same thing in different ways.   107. growing your own food.  pretty sure the city wouldn t like me growing a garden where i m at.   108. awesome views from up high.  oh  so you re just trying to kill me by giving me a heart attack  is that it  i m afraid of heights.   109. baking things you love.  brownies and cookies and cake  oh my  i ll eat them all and be in even more pain from being unhealthy. great idea.   110. picnics.  if i had someone to go with  sure. but i don t.   111. finding new hobbies.  tried it  and this took all my energy to do. but i actually made it through the list. didn t expect that. i do expect to be downvoted to oblivion when i post my perspective of things though.    i promise no matter what  thing will get better then where they are now  there s so much more to life then feeling down. there s so much you haven t done yet and i hope that now matter what you know how much you are loved  and wanted  and appreciated. it gets better i promise.    how would you know  this may be in r all  but it s from r teenagers  and i ve been suffering from depression for longer than any teenager has been alive. this is my life  full of misery and suffering. this isn t a movie  this is real life. not everyone gets a happy ending.  some of us are just destined to have terrible lives  and lists like this aren t going to help  which is why i took the time to answer all of these.. so that you can see from the perspective of someone who s suffered  who s seriously considered suicide  and who nearly succeeded in doing so.  actions speak louder than words or lists. actually spend the time to listen and try to be there for someone. a lot of people claim to  but aren t. or they promise they re there if you need them  but disappear when you reach out.   the only thing in this list that would truly make my day  that would really make me happy  is a hug. i simple hug. it could mean the entire world to someone. ,2020-11-14 18:13:36
64283,aside from my depression i m also depressed and going through a divorce.   it s a long story. feel free to frequent my posts in r deadbedroom and or r divorce.   bottom line  i miss him. i feel like i m always going to miss him. and i m afraid that i ll never know what it feels like to be even a little bit happy with yourself and your life.,2020-09-13 20:51:55
175347,i get it. this sounds like every other post on here. but my god  i didn t realize how bad things were getting. i m only 18 and working 50 hours a week  which i shouldn t feel bad about  but these 13 hour works days are killing me. i can t quit either of them because i don t drive  i have really bad driving anxiety  and i got accepted into my dream college  which i should be happy about  right  i m just not. i don t even care that much because i m having no help paying. neither of my parents are contributing or co signing on a loan  and i wasn t the best academically  so most scholarships are out of the question. fafsa isn t going to give me shit because of how much my parents make  which is a load of shit since they aren t helping me at all. not only that but sad is really kicking in and it doesn t help one bit. i can t tell my parents about how i m feeling because they ll tell me that i have nothing to be depressed about they have it harder and don t complain. i get called lazy for not doing simple tasks when i ve worked all day and want to sleep before i have another shift. i currently have two friends that talk to me on a daily basis  and i have anxiety that i m too much for them and that they don t really care and will leave like everyone else did after i graduated high school. i know that i m starting college next fall but i honestly don t know if i can make it that far. i m not even suicidal  i just want to feel cared about and have support without people shitting on every decision i make.,2021-10-18 17:35:06
5674,i would like to implement 10 minutes of meditation into my days  but i m struggling a bit what part of the day would be most suitable for this. i also would like to implement the habit of 30 minutes reading into my days  but preferably not at the same part of the day as my meditation is scheduled. what do you prefer  and why  ,2021-12-15 10:25:01
6944,my childhood friend  19  gave birth and i am so sentimental about it  i cant stop crying. i don t know why  when she first told me she was pregnant  i started crying too   and she was shocked because no one else in her family cried. she wasn t a very close friend either  i have known her since elementary school but lost communication. she is not my best friend  but she was when we were little. i keep looking at pictures of her daughter and her  and i start crying. i think i feel like she is gone  now she is a mom  no longer a kid  like i feel. it hit me hard. has someone experienced this ,2021-10-09 00:48:33
4946,marrying the wrong person can mess up your mental health  your credit score  your relationship with your family  kids  your career  seriously can impact every facet of your existence.  that person can make every situation worse and less pleasurable.  the right person may not make you a success in all that you do  but can make the bad times bearable and the good times even better.    choose wisely,2021-07-14 21:40:09
10649,i ve noticed that a lot of the jobs listed on linkedin or other career sites that are remote are usually just scams.   i am specifically looking to see if there is a way to search for certain keywords that will only bring up job listings via workday or some other large hr platform that legitimate companies use.   thanks ,2021-12-19 14:39:50
7938,folks tend to sleep better with less light pollution. having a big bright screen going is pretty much the exact opposite. if you can t easily turn off your monitor and have the audio continue  a flat black photo will seriously cut down the light. can easily whip one up in paint or search one up to download to match your screen size. on a computer just put a bookmark in your browser to the photo s location  and swap to full screen mode  f11 key or a button you can put on the bar in most desktop browsers   and let your media of choice play in the background as you snooze.,2021-10-03 17:59:31
47052,hi  i am a 22 year old person  and most my friend belong to a similar age group.  the corona lockdown is still going on my country.  while  i am doing fine  most of my friends are really depressed due to various factors.  2 of them have self harmed in the past week  one overdosed herself on her medication.  i try to talk to them  but there is ony much i am able to do from so far away.,2020-07-10 14:57:50
88178,i was diagnosed 4 years ago and have also been working on some bpd traits i have and i ve never felt  cured . i sure have had hopefull days  weeks or even months with little disturbance but it always comes back and when it does i m a mess. suicide and self harm seems like a good idea and the utter feeling of worthlessness  self pity and lack of a future is making me feel that i ll never get rid of this burden even if it s currently under relative control and no where near as bad as it used to be. idk if it s the bpd symptoms that are just making me a mess or depression but what scares me is that through all these 4 years i ve had therapy i have gotten so much better but i still don t see a future. i have a lovely boyfriend and we talk about family  dreams  goals  plans and i don t know how to explain i actually never think about it. it makes me sad to even consider it. i just want to be a happy person for at least half the time.,2020-12-08 13:29:15
4553,i ve had a bit of a rough ride over the last few years with choices made that i was blind to at the time and its left me with pretty much nothing. just looks for someone to talk too  play video games with and just generally have a laugh with.   this isnt something i d usually do but i can feel my mental slipping and just trying to keep my head above water,2021-07-31 15:48:43

3345,i have been experimenting with various meditation techniques hopping from techniques focusing on breath    focus on chakras  mantras etc ...now i have moved to focusing on nothing   bring the state of mind to now ...i feel very peaceful after meditation concludes . i feel very peaceful .  but since a week in midway of my sitting i find strong uncalled   unwarranted vibration in my throat region difficult to explain maybe as if someone tickling   energy pumping .. difficult to handle and move away my focus . i have no symptoms to say my throat chakra is blocked .... not sure what do i make of this   any opinions  ,2021-07-24 10:29:48

192891,last night i saw my ex having fun at a club and it triggered me to the point of forcing myself to vomit. even though i m not fat  i still see myself as fat. i just don t want to eat so i can be thin  unfortunately i feel like it ll never be thin. since the beginning of 2020  i lost over 100lbs  but it left me with excess skin around my belly area. even though i m thinner  i ve felt so unattractive with that extra skin. i ve been told that even if i worked out  my skin might be to the point to where i d need surgery instead. it frustrates me so much then seeing my ex  who wears clothes just a size or 2 bigger than me  who wears a small  who looks attractive  i feel like i can t compete. an 8 year  toxic relationship left me with bad ptsd  so i feel like i ll always be fat and ugly ,2021-12-19 19:11:10
7849,if you are lonely and keep waiting for a friend or a so to be happy  you ll never be. first because other people s lives don t revolve around you  and they are also pursing their own happiness  and second because none wants the burden of being responsible for someone s joy and will to live. it s tiresome and stressful. get professional help.,2021-09-30 22:18:49
989,okay  i m having trouble mediating for past 8 years now for this simple issue. no matter how far i progress in mediation  the swallowing reflex keeps holding me back.  got to hypnogogic stage once and got flung out with a random swallow.  u tried to moisten my throat with olive oil but it only does so little in keeping away the swallow.   any tips please     ,2021-03-31 11:27:32

1397,seems obvious  but thermometers are useful beyond meat. i ve started using it when i bake breads  cakes  pies  casseroles  etc and the majority of what i make is perfectly done now. no more stressing about cutting into a dry or undercooked cake or serving a casserole with a finger hole in it  you can buy a  15 instant read digital thermometer that s magnetic so it s at the ready on your stove  or in my case   vent hood . i still recommend using the times in recipes as a rough estimate of when you need to start taking readings.    amp  x200b   you can usually find the recommended temperatures by using a search engine.  carrot cake internal temperature  told me 205 209 deg f  and it was spot on. here s a handy starter list   https   renecarter.wordpress.com 2016 12 25 baked goods internal temperature chart   https   renecarter.wordpress.com 2016 12 25 baked goods internal temperature chart  ,2021-04-05 11:30:29

5443,i m wondering if anyone has had the experience of seeing their surroundings with their eyes closed   it first happened to me during a reiki session where i could see the outline of the healer s hands over my eyes with my eyes closed. after the session i asked her about it and she told me that my third eye is open and that s probably why i could see her.   i ve been doing some light meditation  putting a crystal over my third eye and it seems like i can see my surroundings with eyes closed if in the right state. in some cases i wasn t sure if it was my mind playing tricks on me with my eyelids opening slightly  but in one case where it felt the lid of the third eye was opening i put my finger in front of my left and right eyes and didn t see anything  so it does seem like something is happening here.   i also have seen some white orbs bobbing up and down  with eyes open   any advice would be appreciated.,2021-12-01 04:41:40
166728,it s so much worse when you gather yourself after your pieces have been floating around for a while and you aren t allowed to. some external force  some constant source of trauma  some real yet shadowless being keeps getting in the fucking way. the funny thing is we re always told to keep going and to stay hopeful and we do. we do and constantly find it in ourselves to drag behind these words if not for anyone but ourselves. it gets to a point where it s not worth anything to keep running head into walls as strong and stagnant as the egyptians pyramids. and yes  i am referencing one of the seven wonders of the world because despite being shadowless it has the potential of tipping me over to my edge. so as i was saying  is it still worth it  every answer i can hear you think i can genuinely rebuttal in a nietzche kind of way. there s nothing to say  so just please listen. i say it s not worth the everyday battle when you can intentionally just choose to wither away. it s a state of not seeing or planning for more than an hour into the future. a visual of a black hole past the youtube video and meal right in front of you. it s living like you re in hospice with a fake sense of peace you ve created for yourself. you stay and play in front of this mirage with not an ounce of expectation or fuss about what s to lay ahead for you. one day that shadowless being will become simply a shadow and you will flourish. you will tap into the miniature beautiful loving version of you  that feels  and is so beautifully authentically you. one day it will be safe enough to break out of your cocoon and become that butterfly your younger self would follow with your eyes  fingers  and whole body in awe. you will have the chance to at least morph into one. the dull hospice life will not be the energy bank you use to charge your sheath with. she will become you and you will become her.,2021-09-16 23:02:57

3112,i have been meditating for 40 years. i read some basic books decades ago. through trial and error  and much practice  i am able to reach a meditative state where i am no longer conscious of my breathing  heart rate  or any physical connection to my body. i have reaped the benefits of this state for a very long time. i am able to maintain this state for hours. it is here that i seek direction if i don t  know how to proceed  pray  and contemplate my existence. there are no images  colors or shapes  only black. it is a state of only conciousness. in this state there is only what i bring. is this nothingness  i am aware there is a state of conciousness beyond this. generally i stay here but on occasion i have tried to go beyond this where i have been violently brought back to being aware of my surroundings as if i stopped breathing. am i doing something dangerous  i appreciate any input or if anyone has similar experiences.,2021-07-12 22:49:12

194804,i really needed a place to take things out of my chest anonymously. and to ask for advice  if this thing i have become can be fixed.  i  33f  used to be the most compassionate  sensitive  kind hearted person. i m an empath  at least i used to be. i struggled with depression my whole adult life. recently my toddler s pediatrician told me that she thinks i have severe anxiety and should seek professional help. i looked up symptoms of anxiety  and most of the things going on in my mind were explained.  nowadays i m a cynic. i m like the worst person you can meet. i don t let it show  in fact on the outside i seem the sweetest person ever. the truth is i m so hateful inside. i hate everyone. including myself. in fact  i loathe myself. i really   really   can t stand me anymore. i used to be so loving  i would get physically sick if i thought anything would happen to people i love. now i don t think i can feel love anymore. i feel numb. i don t know how i became like this. deep inside  i feel like that loving person is hidden somewhere beneath all this anger and hatred  but i m not sure if that s true. i m not sure anymore that this person exists.  i won t go into details  but in a few words my family  mom  dad  brother  were always very loving but also very judgmental on me being sensitive and quick to blame me for everything that happened. i feel like i was an easy target. years of this really took a toll on me  sometime around 28 i felt like i was treated unfairly  i became resentful  felt they never really loved me and took a 180 turn. from a sweet  kind person  i became a cynical  verbally abusive piece of shit.  i regret everything now  i feel like a garbage human being and really don t know what to do with myself. my mom the other day told me what she really thought of me  she basically told me i m awful and will die alone. that my husband and son will have enough of me eventually and leave me. i cried all day yesterday. i feel like i definitely deserved it  and that it s true. she compared me with an awful aunt of mine  and she did the exact same thing when i was 7. when i was 7 she used to compare me with her because i didn t laugh all the time. i was shy and kept to myself. she kept telling me yesterday that if i want to become that good  kind person i used to be i should call her. or else she doesn t want me anymore. although i deserved it 100   i kept thinking why that 7 year old deserved it. why that 17 year old deserved to be told that she belongs to a mental institution. everything came back to me and i m so sad.  i feel i didn t have the best parents  but also not the worst  and that it s my fault i took this route instead of working on my feelings. i really loathe me and don t want me anymore. i think if i didn t have a child i would kill myself. i hate what i have become. i hate that i m full with hatred and want to take it on other people. i really want to work on me to be better for me  my child and my husband  but to be honest i feel like i m a lost case. that i can t be fixed. like i deserve to be hated by everyone  exactly as i hate myself.  does anyone now if you can  fix  cynicism and hatred  and become kind again  or is it just not how things work ,2021-12-28 06:52:48

99609, i ve  23m  been feeling very suicidal lately had 3 failed attempts  so i ve been trying to focus on my tether to this world. knowing that my little sister  my heart and soul  would be the one to find my body when i do it . leaving her completely alone with no safety net and adding the pain she s already dealing with hurts me to my core. but i m so exhausted. i honestly don t know how long i can stay here for her. we re so close. like inseparable. i was the one who changed her diapers when my mom had to work overtime at the hospitals. and i loved every gross moment of caring for her. because growing up my dad really did his best to destroy my mom  my brother  and myself. so i promised that i will make sure that she knows her worth and how much she is loved. she s the first person i came out to. and vice versa. we are just two weirdos who can comfortably exist with each other and i m so lucky to have one person in my life this important. but sometimes i wish i didn t. it ll be easier. i just know in my heart that if i kill myself  it won t be long until she does. so  i can t. and i m just here. in this limbo state of existing until i m needed. completely and utterly pathetic.,2021-01-10 07:09:36

117194,you know i never thought that being born different from others  would be so much harder. being physically weaker from the start  never gotten a chance to prove myself.   and the pain start at young age such as 7 years old. and it just gradually worsen until you re 21 years old.   but the worst part is not how you re physically or mentally exhausted from trying your hardest to live. but  its how you trying to fake it and show s the others that you re fine. and when sometimes you re not  they never care  even if you re trying to hint them.   my father looks at me  like i m a burden to him. always need to buy medicines  always needs to feeds me. why i never had a job until now. then my brother who would release all his anger and stressed on me  because i never gotten  mad angry  and just take it all in. i m weak.   all these chronic pains  depression  anxiety and trauma. makes me feel like  why me  you know  they said   god  wouldn t give the hardest task to a soul  whom couldn t take it. i tell you right now  i couldn t. so he missed me on this one.   i felt like  tonight may be the day. its too much to handle  and the pain without any medicines that could ease the pain is close to nonexistent. i see you guys on the other side. i m sorry  i lost the fight  maybe next time  i could be stronger. i love you mama  i m sorry i couldn t be your strong fighters no more. you deserve the whole world  for taking care of me. if i was forgiven up by him  i promise i would wait for you  and bring you to the paradise.,2021-03-15 12:50:17

5039,how the meditation went..  i was sitting on a park bench and then i was joined at the bench by a fellow redditor that i had spoken with yesterday  spoken with in real life . she took my hand and i went walking down what looked like a normal park path with her. we arrived at a stone cottage that had what looked like lights on inside and i could partially see a chandelier through the window.  when i walked through the door to the stone cottage i was transformed to a  real  memory when i was around 4 years old. my mother had sent me to a family friend s house. they were a wealthy couple and had a beautiful home. while i was there  i played with their son. i remember being nervous the entire time and not being able to eat much. i also remember having a crush on their daughter and being afraid to be around her.   my mother sent me to their house because at that time in my life  4 years old  i was not eating much food  very skinny and very nervous all the time. my mother thought that me going to these stable people s home  playing with their son  eating their food and feeling their vibes  didn t have stability in our home  could help me.  as i sat with that memory in the meditation i felt this knowing that i was afraid of expressing my wants. i was afraid of telling the family friend s daughter that i liked her. i also realized that because i didn t eat much at that age and that i was heavily encouraged to eat food at that time and that may have been the beginning of me becoming an over eater. it s an issue i ve dealt with in my life since then. fortunately  i manage my weight fine  but i do eat fast and a lot when i sit down to eat.   that part of the meditation left me with the impression that the lesson here was to understand where my fear of approaching women stems from as well as my habit of overeating.   i continued with the mediation and the rest of the mediation  i really don t understand and would appreciate any thoughts or insight..  when i left the cabin  the female redditor was waiting outside for me. in her hand she had a gift that she gave me. it was a dagger that was shaped almost like the musician prince s symbol. i actually chuckled when i saw it haha. she then took off her clothes and grabbed my hand and we continued walking down the path and talking about the fear and overeating insights i received that i mentioned earlier.    we continued down the path and arrived at another building. this building looked more modern  almost like it was in the future. when i opened the door and entered there were two women in the nude on a big bed in the middle of the room. one was blonde and one was brunette and they had masks on that covered just their eyes and noses. like the kind of masks you would see in victorian times  i think.. anyhow  i walked towards them and stood in front of them and then realized i was nude and the women basically just ran their hands all over my body and i ran my hands over them.   i then left the room and the redditor was outside  this time with her clothes on and another gift box in her hand. this time it was a set of keys to a new corvette. i chuckled again because i m sort of a minimalist and have never owned a new car.   her and i walked back to the bench  hugged and then she walked away and i came out of the meditation.  i feel like i definitely understand the first vision from the stone cottage and what it means to me. what i don t get is everything that happened afterwards  in particularly the gifts i received.  any thoughts or insights on this meditation would be very much appreciated  thank you.,2021-11-03 15:35:31

66147,when i was 8 my dad tried to commit suicide and  instead of dying  became a paraplegic with severe brain damage. i m 30 now and i still wish i could bury my face in my father s arms and just cry my fucking eyes out. instead every time i visit him in the nursing home i have to put on a brave face.. i hate it. him living this way was a worse outcome than him dying. i m left with the empty shell he left behind...,2020-09-21 03:33:23
85519,i always dreamed of working from home and have been incredibly lucky to do it for the last 8 months.   maybe i wasn t feeling grateful enough  but i was asked to come in today. and it hasn t been bad. busy  but whatever. it s busy when i m at home too.   but at home... i m in pajamas  snacking  cat in my lap  music on... taking it at my pace. if i get frustrated  i say  brb  and sit on my porch for a few minutes.   i have to put on a mask when the phone rings but they can t see me. they don t see me eye roll when they didn t turn on the printer. they don t realize i m watching tv on mute while they re scrambling to find a wire.   today  they stand over me as i run through the troubleshooter. as i crawl under desks. watching watching watching. every time i sit down and put in one headphone   hey v approves is in it  come here   no having to wait in the call queue  putting in a ticket... nope  they come right to me and i have to drop whatever i m on. put my mask back on  sanitize  and hope they keep their mask on and don t breathe in my face.   again  this is making me grateful but god  i don t know if any part of me can go back to working in an office 5 days a week. physically  emotionally  spiritually... it is so incredibly draining.  it gets more frustrating because  according to my boss  we re as productive as before wfh.  i started as wfh started so i ll take his word for it.  and maybe i m catastrophizing.... there s no talk of bringing it back.... but today just reminds me that this is what i have to look forward to for the next 40 years.   why does america hate wfh so much  ,2020-11-30 13:44:00
30548,i think everyone who knows the struggle with depression knows the downward spiral feeling   day 1 it s manageable you can still put on your fake face. day 2 can vary. today my morning of day 2 i grabbed a knife from my bedside drawer and sat in the shower and cried. there is not an in between for me. day 2 feels like the wave has crashed and the only thoughts i have are devastating. i feel alone  i know i m not but it s an controllable feeling that i can t shake. i know i should look forward to the future  but i feel trapped inside my own thoughts. i have isolated myself to having just my partner to talk to and i feel guilty dumping my tears and sadness on him when he also struggles with depression. i ve been home for almost 2 month and every day i spend alone drives me deeper into these thoughts. today is just not a good and i hope i make it to the end of the day. i wish i knew how to turn this switch off.,2020-05-14 11:20:56
33086,i have always found myself as an annoying human being  this wouldn t normally bother me but tonight it s really getting to the fact of  what if people only tolerate me so that i don t feel left out   or just the general thought of people only tolerating me so that i feel like somewhat of a human being. i feel as if people only speak to me out of sympathy that i m more on the loner side. and i feel as if i have no true friends that i can turn to. each passing moment tonight i feel as if i m less and less of a human being and more as if i am worthless  only here to serve as a filler in a void. i feel very hurt and i m beginning to even doubt the love of my closest friends  i ve slowly lost the one person who truly loved me and i m beginning to doubt if that was even true. i m beginning to want to end this feeling that i am nothing  i just want to breathe and know i m here for a reason  but i feel trapped instead  i want to be something  but i m beginning to be cautious of the people who i love  putting up barriers for even my favorite people. i want to be something  but i also want it to be over with...,2020-05-23 02:40:16
5014,my son s iphone alarm was going off upstairs and i was too lazy to go wake him up to turn off the alarm so i called his phone and hung up as soon as it rang and it was like hitting snooze on the alarm versus listening to it for a minute.,2021-07-16 11:27:53
160805,i ve joined  this community after my cousin died from suicide because i new he used reddit a lot and i ve been trying to feel what he felt like because i wanted to understand it. i ve replied to some posts trying to support or somehow give strengh to people because i felt so miserable after he passed away that i couldn t bare staying there just existing. but now i find myself having the same thoughts. i am a disgusting being i don t feel passionate about anything  or anyone anymore and i want to disapear yet i texted people to stay  my mind is so full i can t even process my thoughts and i m just typing. anyways sorry to anyone who might get trigged or something cause it seems  like i lost the hability to express myself and i just hate being forced to be here.,2021-08-26 13:24:05
153680,first i want to say this will be a long post into multiple sections and i am really interested in hearing both how others view my situation but also what they think in general  especially advice basically please just tell me anything.  1  general life  i was born into a upper middle class armenian family in a developed area close to los angelos. money has always been a thing and never a issue  the problem being literally everything else is missing in my life.   i am the least fucking materialistic person i know. i couldn t give a shit less about expensive clothing or cars. showing of wealth has been soooooo common by people ik and it s so fucking shallow and lame to see. the things i care about  family connections relationships  are completely absent in my life.  2 growing up  i was a shy fat kid growing up and was bullied allot. i had trouble talking to people and was always alone. at the most i would have 1 3 friends that were not close at all and just tolerated me. i couldn t relate to anyone and was always left out and ignored. this has affected me to this day with no one i can call a real friend.   in high school i got a 10ish fiend group but i am not close to them either. all they talk about is basketball and marvel and i just stay quiet and don t say much. i can t relate to them and they are immature as fuck. also showing hard incel behavior.  3  really fucking alone  i literally didn t go outside growing up. after coming home from school my life was video games and watching youtube. i probably went out 7 times from birth to age 18 with other people. i was so fucking lonely. i just wanted a friend group. i wasn t rude or gross  literally just the shy kid no one talked to in elementary school and of course that carried over since most of my classmates were the same.   4  dark times shit family  age 15 to 18 i was so fucking depressed borderline suicidal. i hated life. i realized i literally had no hobbies  no friends  no family  no dreams. i hated my narcissistic  bitchy  jealous  materialistic family members so fucking much.   armenians tend to have massive family trees but me and my brother are the youngest by far. almost everyone is 30  most 50  so we couldn t relate or connect with anyone. they were all boomers with old fashioned out dated middle eastern beliefs in life and were obnoxious to be around. very sexist and materialistic. very petty behavior.   i grew up surrounded by mostly armenians even outside of family and almost everyone acted the same. the stereotype of my race which is mostly true is that we do fraud and will sue you until you literally have nothing and your life is ruined. i don t understand how so many armenians i met act like this  yaa dude so funny and cool that i ruined someone s life for money hahahaha am i right  they are obsessed with money and showing off shit.  almost no one was genuine and didn t have an actual personality. i hate my race. i hate my family  i hate the people i grew up with.   my mom and dad were never parents. a parent in my eyes is someone who gives lessons and helps me develop and lead my own life. all morals values and beliefs were me and my bro only. the most advice they gave is  go to school and get a good job  wow literally einstein level advice. my  parents  were providers in me and my brothers eyes. we had money but no memories of them. my dad never bonded or learned anything with us. he was the chill laid back dad which sounds nice but i literally didn t have a dad i could bond with. in his eyes as long as we had money that s all we needed.  fucking dumbass  my mom is an insane narcissistic  raging  anger issues psycho bitch. ik that sounds awful but i swear my mother screamed and raged over the tiniest bullshit and would slap me and my brother growing up. i have more memories of her screaming than acting normal.   waking up to constant fighting and yelling was common and very obnoxious. we can t talk or negotiate with her at all. it s her way or fuck off. she is so fucking rude and thinks she is smarter than me or my brother even though she never graduated high school. me and my bro are convinced she has some mental issues but of course armenian pride shuns mental health care so if we suggested it  she would take it as an insult. petty fucking bitch.  5  dating and current life  once i turned 19 i realized if my life didn t change i would kill myself soon. so i started working out and trying to find hobbies that can make me happy and a passion in life. i got buff and am now more confident but something else also happened. around this time before i turned 19 i realized i really want a relationship.   let me be clear . i am not the type of guy to want to use women or be a selfish person. i don t want or expect me to fuck some supermodel 11 10 women every week or some shit and disrespect women like a player would. all i want is to fall in love with someone and get married and have a family. not right away but in the future for sure a family. i want to cuddle and hold hands with someone  make love with someone who loves me as well. to watch a movie and go on dates with each other. to know me and the other person both provide emotional support and love. to know we always have each other s backs. someone i can call my best friend and really live my life with.   i am not sure if i m ugly or not anymore. i m short 5 2  so fucking horrible right   and have a big nose. but i m buff  have a good personality  and really nice facial hair. women constantly claim personality is always better than looks but i find this shit so hard to beleive. almost every couple i see in every day life has a pretty good looking guy and girl. very rarely do i see a man who is noticeably uglier than the women.   i have always been a kind person who respected others and always wanted to help. hell i want to be a therapist and help others mental struggles for fucks sake. i am capable of having deep meaningful smart conversation  love cooking and would love to cook for my partner and family  can connect with people i think  and am very funny. i can make a room laugh multiple times no problems without breaking a sweat if i feel comfortable. people seem to enjoy being around me guys and girls.  keep in mind this is after graduating public education and coming out of my shell    also it doesn t fucking help that 3 girls confessed to me in my life and all 3 have done it as a cruel joke and to make fun of me for literally just existing. but i noticed the only time women ever showed any interest me is this past year. i got muscles and walked straighter now after doing yoga but guess what     im still the same fucking person personality wise   but of course all of a sudden in irl interaction wayyyy more girls are now flirting and being friendly with me now     wow  ..  i m not sure if i should count it since it s covid masks so they can t see my face most of the time but still. i don t consider it real attraction for now. this is seriously fucking with me.   especially since my brother who is. a huuuuuuuge cocky egotistical douchebag gets dates and laid constantly even though he is a very dumb and rude person socially. so please tell me why the fuck are so many women attracted to these kinds of people  irl and reddit we constantly see posts about guys who never got a chance with anyone and   constant  trigger warning  posts about women bitching moaning and complaining  about guys who use them for sex or never look for anything serious or complain about complete assholes  or guys who don t put any effort in. why the fuck do these awful guys get a chance when i personally think i can provide value and literally never got noticed until now. i m still a hand hold less virgin and any time a girl shows any attraction now  i really enjoy it and partake it in but. in the back of my mind i m bitter as shit. you cheap shallow fucking whores are now giving me a chance     yaaaaa so much about personality mattering more  complete fucking bullshit in my experience.   i m worried when i find someone where the attraction is mutual i will feel so angry and guarded about this person. do they like me for me or are they just shallow like the rest  and please don t spew shit like men do this as well. of course they do but i m talking about my situation and experiences. i have definitely fallen for girls that are not traditionally attractive because they have wonderful personalities and i like talking to them. i have never seen this occur to me or anyone i know of personally. it feels like such a bullshit lie that women especially spew this crap but i have not seen this once in my experience.   side point  and yea i acknowledge both sides may have it tough in terms of dating i genuinely logically can t agree that women have it the same or harder. women are flooded with matches in online dating and irl are expected to do nothing and be approached. i m trying to work up the courage to do it in public now but it s very disheartening and annoying that i m expected to be some fucking jester doing all the work and courting while the women just judges me and decides if she wants to play or not.   i ll admit i don t have the best online dating profile mainly bumble and hinge since i hear that s what anyone who wants something genuine goes for. my bio is very detailed and makes it clear i am looking for something serious so that s fine i think. maybe i should add some sarcasm or humor to it idk. the biggest thing is my pictures are meh. i never took pictures of myself until i was 19 so early 2020 and with covid literally shutting any social or cool places i can go and take nice pics in i m fucked. i don t have the budget to spend hundreds to get my photos done by a pro either.   but besides barely getting matches which i will admit i can improve my photos on. the matches i do get are fucking horrible. once again women bitch and complain about men being shit at conversation when every match i ve gotten off these apps about 7ish so far  has been awful on their end. i give detailed thorough responses while mentioning something in their profile and getting to know them while they give some fucking dry bare bones basic bitch response.   most convos end with the girl ghosting or just not replying so i m fucking trying even when i do match but nothing happens. they then sleep with some hot guy and complain and feel betrayed when they get used and ghosted themselves when the guy was just looking for sex lol.   6  covid big trigger warning  okay ik everything i m about to say is very controversial but i don t care anymore. i am so sick and fucking done with lockdown and restrictions. let me be clear that the first 18 years of my life were awful and when i turned 19 at the start of 2020 i was set on a mission to improve and be happy. i wanted to start bouldering at my local gym. i wanted to start weightlifting for health and physical gains. plus getting more attractive of course. i wanted to fix my awful spine and scoliosis. i wanted to be more social and join clubs in college while meeting people.   the short semester i did have at college pre covid was amazing and 1000000x better than public education. people were nice and cool and more mature. professors were better as well. i wanted to volunteer at the animal shelter since i love animals and wanted to make friends and connections their as well. i had so much energy and eagerness to get out there and finally take control of my life. then a fucking disease from china came and put the world on hold literally 2 fucking weeks after i started these goals. no more school  no gym  no animal shelter  no clubs  no social interaction  no friends  no dating  fuck you stay inside.   while the start of covid was scary with lack of information at this point i am so fucking done. i am not taking the vaccine when 3 people i know had heart attacks or blood clot issues quickly after getting it  2 of which resulted in the person fucking dying. i am very healthy and have strong lungs and immune system i am not scared of a fucking disease with 98  survival rate. i am sick and tired of these restrictions and lockdowns and i know majority are as well. months later gyms and yoga finally opened up and i went fucking hard. i fixed my spine and gained lots of muscles so i wasn t using covid as an excuse or anything.   and i m so fucking sick and tired of how all the other sides problems with lockdowns are completely ignored and your treated like a criminal if you bring them up. mental health  physical health  sexual abuse  child abuse  domestic abuse  suicide rates  loneliness  unemployment  homelessness  drug addiction and plenty of other stats skyrocketed due to these fucking lockdowns and restrictions but of course the news and other people don t bring it up. oh and let s not forget my 3 year old nephew who didn t get to see other people or socialize in the real world like my 6 year old niece did. this poor kid is so fucking shy and lacking any social development that going outside and seeing people makes him really scared and nervous. lol of course the possible long term effects are not talking about much either.   tell me is a fucking disease this  deadly  worth all these downsides and problems       you tell me  . let me live my fucking life again .. its very hard to flirt and date in person with a fucking mask covering most of your face. i can t even be sure the girls that were flirting with me were real since they couldn t see my fucking face. may i please live and enjoy my fucking life now      i m not wasting more time for the same people who ignored me and never once helped or kicked me down. fuck you .  7 perspective  now i will explain the other side of my situation and what i have done or extra notes really. i can t beat myself up to hard since the stuff i want is literally not available. i still can t volunteer or go to college in person. i was so fucking excited for college. i started bouldering since the rock climbing gym finally opened recently and i love it so far. i can t even fucking think of how much further i would be if it weren t for this fucking virus and lockdowns.   i already met some cool people and can hopefully make some friends there soon. i already made plenty of gym buddies there so hopefully friendship is next. plus plenty of cute girls and no i m not hitting or creeping on them. part of me genuinely thinks that if my life hadn t been put on pause for a fucking year  i would be doing much better. i would of made friends and possibly got a girlfriend at college or at the shelter. i would even more buff and healthy. i would be a much better at rock climbing and more into that community. and so much more.,2021-08-01 18:16:31

892,when and where appropriate of course.   my father passed when i was 14 and i still don t know a whole lot about him. one of my favorite things is to learn more about him when i can. it can be comforting hearing how a loved one impacted someone in a good way or accomplished something they never talked about.,2021-03-12 18:10:18

9651,im not suicidal. i feel like my bestfriend would be better off without me in her life. scenarios run through my head of that happening and i almost want to just tell her   hey i m not good for you. i think you should continue on without me in your life and i ll continue my own way.  i feel like an awful friend. too anxious about certain things. insecure that i ask too many questions and say i m sorry too much to where i overthink that maybe she thinks i m not trying my best. that i dont mean it. i feel like a fucking asshole and i was feeling really good for awhile. idk what happened. i overthink and assume sometimes that she dosnt want to be around me  talk to me  or she dosnt like me and wont tell me. that i make her uncomfortable. we tend to be open but i m afraid she wont. i m afraid shes just sticking around just because and not because she wants to. i feel angry at myself for thinking so less of her and myself. i feel angry. i feel bad for probably making her feel bad  confused or stressed. i feel like shit and i ve been fighting myself for days. i got super insecure at a wedding last night and our other friend was there. they re bestfriends too and i feel like she likes her more than me. like gravitates towards her more and i fought it pretty well and just did my own thing. i hate myself for feeling that way but it really hurts thinking that maybe she dosnt like me.,2020-03-01 14:14:45

127835,i have come to the realization that i have so completely emotionally detached myself from life that i don t think i ll ever feel something again. but i stopped wanting to kill myself  if only out of cowardice... so that s nice. still  i had to emotionally detach from my dad when he left and my mom because she stayed and it was awful. i had to emotionally detach from the rest of my family  because they re all women and so they take my mom s side and they have been doing so since i was like 7 years old and my mom was chasing me around the house hitting me because i didn t wash the windows or whatever  then when one of them would walk in she would cry and they would comfort her  leaving me crying by myself in the corner because i was a  man   7 years old  and i just needed to man up. i hate everything. i just want to stop. i can t feel love  i ll always be too broken to be loved  no one will ever love me  every woman i ve ever dated has brought up my height within ten minutes.,2021-05-02 23:16:58

104040,i wish i had a different life. i wish i had a different family. my family is the most dysfunctional that i ve ever seen. it makes me depressed seeing all these families so close with each other and they are successful. they are supportive  positive  and lift each other up. mine on the other end isn t. my parents are divorced. i believe both of my parents are toxic. i can t open up to my mom. when i try  she shuts me down. she tells me she doesn t want to hear about my problems or doesn t want to listen to me talk about myself. it feels like walking on eggshells around my moms. my dad doesn t seem to really listen to me. he think mental illness doesn t really exist and how it s all in your head. he s with multiple women. i walked in on him when i was visiting on thanksgiving. he jumped into his bed very quickly like he was doing something shady. my dad has also sent my brother a video of him jerking off and claimed it was an accident. he said he sent it to the wrong person. my brothers seem to have turned out toxic as well. one of my brothers hates me and talks bad about me behind my back. for example. when he found out i was coming over to the families for thanksgiving. i was told he was texting my mom throwing a fit. my other brother told me how he talks about all the time of how much he hates me. then the one brother that recently visited me at my moms. he got mad. my brother told me a couple days ago something about what my dad says about me claiming he talks bad about me as well. then i brought it up to my mom. he called me a liar. i was assaulted in 2016 at gunpoint. my brother told me that the people who did it should have ended my life right there. he told me he doesn t care if i m alive or dead. all i want is some positivity in my life. i want to wake up happy. i want to eat dinner at the table and have a positive conversation. i want to love each other and forgive. i want to have fun. i want to feel loved and wanted. we don t know when our last minute could be on earth. i just don t see this ever happening with my family. if i had millions of dollars. i would more than likely cut them all off and disappear.,2021-01-23 11:54:35

138245,i have no right to feel the way i do  i never suffered severe abuse or difficult family issues or great trauma in my life  but i have never been anything other than sad and anxious. even as a child i was just sad  and it never left. it was only accompanied by anxiety that developed early on and continues to persist. i mean  i didn t have the greatest time in all my years  saying this as only a stupid 19 year old   i was bullied from the get go  starting from kindergarten to now. i feel i never stood much of a chance in that way. as adolescence crept up  i began down the fun path of diagnoses  therapy  and medication. at 14 i was diagnosed with major depression  generalized anxiety  social anxiety   agoraphobia  and ocd. i would later at 17 be described and treated as  on the bipolar spectrum   whatever that means or is at all medically recognized. at 18 i was diagnosed with chronic insomnia that has only gotten worse to date.  i think i am just a sad person  i don t know any other way to describe it. that is the median  my default  if that makes sense. as this sadness is all i ve experienced  there is no  happy time  for me to compare to  or for anyone in my life to compare to. however cliche it sounds  i put on a mask when in contact with anyone. it s not so much that i m pushing out some fake happiness  but more so covering the sadness for that duration of time. putting a sheet over it.  no one thinks i am depressed really as this is how i ve always been lived and there is no valid reason for me to be depressed. when i ever have told anyone  they are surprised  and or simply brush it off as if it is nothing as they don t see it in front of them and don t see any reason for it. i feel like only a partial human  just a piece of a person.  years of ssris  mood stabilizers  anti psychotics  anti anxiety meds  and different sleeping meds have caused pretty bad memory issues and i have trouble remembering things in the past 5 years accurately and many times question if my accounts or recollections are correct.  i have no idea what to do anymore. my parents have spent way too much money on my mental health and i only continue to add to this financial burden with a sleep study approaching and a need of an iop  intensive outpatient program   which is not covered by my insurance and will cost thousands. i feel like an awful daughter  i am a lost cause. i only cause pain as the sad child that only gets worse. i give them sadness  i wish they had a happy child. i am so  so tired of continuing this  turning on for each interaction or task. just trekking goddamn forward so i  won t cause my parents the sadness of having their child commit suicide  or anyone close enough to me which it would poorly effect.,2021-06-07 06:53:50

49827,i ve been manifesting something for like 6 months straight and i ve gone through changes and transformations and i keep seeing signs and things like that  that it s coming but my manifestation hasn t come yet and it s actually really disappointing and kind of makes me want to give up hope because it has been so long. and tbh i m already suicidal and depressed and really like if i don t get my manifestation then i ll just go with my original plan of ending my life senior year. but i also don t want to hold in that thought as like an ultimatum for the universe. and i also feel like that though and plan is inhibiting to my manifestation.,2020-07-20 18:00:33
5002,there s a big trend of reusable products at the moment  which is a really nice idea  but people forget that everything you buy is eventually disposed of. so think about what you re buying and why you re buying it.   if you want a reusable coffee cup  is if good quality and will you actually use it    can you get a refurbished laptop phone instead of a new one    can you buy clothes from a charity shop rather than new ,2021-07-16 04:33:58
10852,i don t know the science behind it  but think is has to do with you blocking of the non irritated lung. i ve allways used this trick when beeing sick or inhaling something in to a lung and just turned my head in the opposite direction  as far as possible over the shoulder  and coughed and it felt like only the irritated lung would do the actual coughing. you can even try it now.,2021-12-24 18:16:46
178460,i went to the doctors today to see about starting ssris to help with depression. i ve been feel so low and like crap every day for months. my appetite has completely disappeared  i m tired all the time and barely sleep  i m stressed to hell and i think about dropped out of uni nearly every day because doing it is difficult.  and she tells me that i don t need antidepressants because i m getting everything submitted and done on time. just because i m high functioning doesn t mean it s easy. every day is a struggle and i feel like no one will listen to me or take me seriously because  i don t look depressed .  i m honestly ready to give up at this point  i m so incredibly frustrated with trying to get help for my mental health and never being taken seriously.,2021-10-29 09:49:22
108068,finally thought that i was having success on dating apps after redownloading and managed to get two girls snap chats. for whatever reason after i sent them snaps they removed me and unmatched with me... i didn t think i was that ugly. i mean we were talking to hours prior to snapping and i m sure the picture i sent wasn t the most flattering  but am i really that bad    it just sucks. i wish i could go out and meet people  but i m too insecure and shy and it s because of things like this. it s not like i m a different person than the pictures... i am literally the person in the photos on my app  i just can t utilize good angles ig. it s fine i guess  you win some you lose some  i just tend to lose. one day i ll find the right person  but obviously that day is not today. i m tempted to just get rid of snapchat once and for all  but then i d lose my main form of communication with my friends...  i guess i ll just go to bed and try not to let it get me down tomorrow although i know it will.,2021-02-08 23:33:36
3389,watcher simply moves forward  enters another womb  another body. and this movement continues  this transmigration of the soul continues till your watchfulness is absolutely pure. when the flame is without any smoke  then you disappear into the universal  into existential. then you are not going into another house  you don t need any house anymore  you have learned the lesson. that was a school  moving from one house to another was moving from one class to another. but one day you graduate  you become part of existence.,2021-07-26 12:13:52

167248,an ex girlfriend destroyed my life. she systematically went through every single friend and ex girlfriend of mine and spread rumours and lies about me. she tore apart my social life  sabotaged friendships  and then submitted a false report to the police about me a year after our breakup.   i m left spending tens of thousands of dollars dealing with her bullshit. no friends. constant anxiety and depression. i ve just lost the will to do anything.. whenever i m left alone my thoughts are always dark and damaging. to numb my mind i watch random videos  movies  or play video games.. there s nothing that brings me join or happiness and i feel as though there is no point to continue living.   i so desperately want to die  i feel like i ll get to relive happier memories as i m passing away.. and if not  at least the pain and torture will end.,2021-09-19 00:51:51

5036,i woke up this morning with no power at my house... i didn t see an outage on the provider map so i wanted to report it but i was worried that maybe it was only affecting my house.   i realized a few minutes later that if the outage affected more than just me then their routers won t be broadcasting a signal  though some people may have these connected to battery backups  so i guess if you just see a lot fewer networks listed then you can also be confident that the power issue is affecting more than just you .,2021-07-17 09:11:32

34670,i m at that stage where i don t necessarily want to kill myself but i don t want to actually be alive anymore. lately i m a bit disgusted at the thought of offing myself and leaving behind a corpse for my family to find. i just don t want to put them through that. i say lately because sometimes i m at points where i just don t give a fuck. but i guess i ve been feeling different the past month.  i just feel like everything is pointless  hopeless  meaningless  any kind of   less you can think of. i know that s the depression speaking. it s weird cause i ve been feeling  better  lately. my definition of better is pathetic  but i guess i d describe it as feeling less bad than i usually feel. i just can t shake this thought deep down that i ll never get better. even if i take my meds or get therapy. it doesn t matter. my life is ultimately pointless. i ve screwed it up too bad and no amount of hardwork will fix it. i m not meant to live  be happy  have a partner  or friends. i simply can t envision bring happy and productive. i feel like the only shit i have to look forward to is loneliness and suffering.  i often feel as though this is what the universe has always had in store for me. there is no free will. this is my fate. i see the world and my existence as meaningless and i ll never be able to unsee that. it sucks. i m just so tired of all this.,2020-05-28 05:24:02

7952,i ve just started an position in my university  in order to do this job i had to be an existing staff at the university .  however  i worked the position during the pandemic without pay.  i m a student . i successfully carried it out for the year so i applied officially and was given the position and an exception was made for me  as i am a student . now  the issue is that the staff members who undertake this role have a lump sum given to their department to make up for any impact on their productivity in their main job  as the job can sometimes interfere with daytime working hours . given that i am not counted as staff  i m a postgrad doing research   i was told that they will not be paying the lump sum.  however  in the lower position i was in prior to being officially appointed  i had free gym membership and the right to a personal development course of my choice. at the moment  my laptop is on the verge of death  i have to use a computer for this job  i ve asked my boss if they could use the money they are saving to grant me a productivity well being package.   as in new laptop  gym membership and access to a course   i was told no. because the other colleagues in this position do not get given those perks   but i must mention that they are salaried staff who have perks though their positions at the university which i don t get  on top of having salaries  which i don t either . how do i go about convincing them to grant me some benefits as i could really use those  the job does not pay much but comes with free nice accommodation ,2021-10-04 06:40:42

2897,i have been meditating for several years. i either am trying to focus on my breath or i am trying to maintain an expansive focus  such as in the guided meditations on the waking up app .   i go through phases of more or less meditation practice. in the beginning of a phase  when it is fresh  things tend to go well. as i settle into a more regular practice  my focus during meditation starts to disintegrate. i read lots of tips about how to approach thoughts that arise  but the problem is that i will forget that i m meditating for nearly the whole session so i can t really implement these tips.  i read and hear about the experiences of seasoned meditators and i would like to get there  but i feel that i am just unable to advance in my practice. i have adhd that may be where part of the struggle comes from  but i d like to believe that everyone can improve. however  for me  it feels like practice leads to declining performance rather than improving.  does anyone have tips on how to deal with this or even just their own related experience to share ,2021-07-01 12:28:09

7133, so  an overview. i recently graduated art school about 3 months ago and just managed to find a min. wage job that s part time while i freelance work towards a career in the entertainment industry. i ve struggled with severe ocd  depression  and anxiety since middle school  and my mother and i currently don t have what i would consider a good relationship. she s a single mom and i have no siblings  and she works from home and is around constantly  as she has no hobbies and almost never goes out.  i don t either due to a lack of friends money   i remember telling her a few weeks ago that i felt unloved and that i felt like she hated me  and that she sometimes makes me feel like i m a burden to her and that she hates me   she uses the  i pay paid for your college insurance  during arguments a lot   and her response to me explaining my feelings was that it was my own fault for feeling that way my own issue had nothing to do with her. she does not respect my personal boundaries  and seems to not believe in my being able to have boundaries because i live in  her house   and because of that  i constantly live in a state of anxiety  fear  and irritation whenever she s home around because i know that my space can be violated anytime  i distinctly remember when i was in high school and she came into my bathroom when i was taking a shower and ripped the shower open to try and tell me something yell at me i don t remember exactly what the issue was   i have a lot of what i think is spotty memory because of  what i think is my depression  and sometimes i have trouble telling certain events apart when and even if they happened. this is not helped by the fact that my mother will deny things that happened lie about certain things  so i m constantly second guessing myself when i talk with her. as of now i m extremely anxious because i have to start paying her rent in a month  and i have to start paying my car phone insurance to her  and because of the wages i ll be making at my new job i ll only have around 150 200 a month leftover to save and use to help myself. i feel overwhelmed and i m struggling mentally at the moment  and i can t escape because i can t go anywhere else. i ll talk more in the comments and explain the situation further  if needed.,2020-02-22 21:11:06
127808,okay...  your point    like  no shit  sherlock. why didn t i think of that    but explain please   explain how i m supposed to be positive when i constantly feel like an idiot  and a burden on everyone around me.   explain how i m supposed to be positive when i feel like my life is going downhill.   explain how i m supposed to be positive when there is literally no point to all this.   explain how i m supposed to be fucking positive when all i want to do is blow my head off with a shotgun  and you and society won t let me because it goes against your idea of a world filled with goodness   fucking explain     you have so much to live for   why are you trying to save me  life isn t for everyone. besides  nobody likes me this way anyway. i m a fucking mess ,2021-05-02 21:50:07
170166,i ve been homeschooled for about two and a half years now  and most of my interactions are online. i have no friends in real life  and live with my grandparents.  recently i ve fallen into terrible habits again. i ve been cutting down my meals  and keep worrying the people i do talk with online  cause i just won t talk for multiple days  weeks  or months.  it s been about 8 days since i ve gone outside  and today i had a bit of a boost and felt like i could finally take out the trash. i tried to hurry cause i didn t want that feeling to go away  and end with me not doing it. i took a couple steps outside and immediately my breathing started picking up. by the time i got to the bin i felt like i was gonna pass out  and once i got back inside i immediately felt better and my breathing started to slow. i feel like a total idiot. i walked outside for a few minutes at most and almost passed out. i don t even know what happened  i just felt very sudden panic  and felt like i needed to go back inside. if anyone could please give any advice or let me know what might be happening  i feel very lazy  and this definitely didn t help.,2021-09-29 17:32:37

153117,i ve fought very very hard this year pulling myself out of the depressive funk i was in i started seeing a counselor. upped my meds got a mood stabilizer.   my background of everything i was very anxious i would get 2 to 3 hours of sleep at night at most my anxiety would wake me and keep me up late. i cried all the time. i d go to work and all i would wanna do is go home get off work to not wanna be at home and cry more  i could sleep my whole days off away and hate myself for it. i was stuck in this loop of anxiety crying work anxiety work off work cry  dissociate until my fiance fell asleep then anxiety sleep anxious cry work anxious off work cry dread going home cry dissociate anxiety sleep and repeat.  until i slept all day on my day off till it was time to get my fiance from work i cried i was contemplating going to the hospital for help until my fiance suggested i see my counselor again immediately started going again it was helping. i was on my medical app with my records and documents looking  i was looking at my meds and disorders found out i was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and no one told me and i looked up symptoms and i see why but i wish i was told  all this time i thought i was crazy no one thinks like me and it makes sense now. i am mentally stuck in the age that most of my trauma came which is my early 20 s i m almost 29 and mentally feel like i m 22  i feel like a teenager more than an adult ...... part of bpd but unfortunately after i  got my depression and anxiety under control my bpd started wigging out i would have such good days at work and i d get off work and feel like crap and cry like no reason at all. those we found are highs and lows and i went through that daily for a month and then went to my counselor and my doctor. i had to work on my relationship and other things but i got on more meds.... now its been a few months since then but i schedule therapy every month but go as needed only haven t gone once. now for the past couple of days i ve been having the highs and lows should i ride it out a little while longer then see my doctor like maybe its just a fluke i don t know just wanted a place to put this.,2021-07-30 17:31:00
7972,hi  i m 17 years old girl from finland  so english is not my first language.. i am pretty good at it and i understand usually everything i have told. but i m very shy to speak in english... does anyone have any ideas how to overcome this  i really would like to have more friends from somewhere else  but this is getting on my way   .,2021-11-03 02:55:59
72556,this is weird for me considering i m really afraid of death. but right now i m probably at my lowest point. with stressing about school  money  and relationships there s just always me thinking that i ll never amount to anything and that i m a waste of life. right now i m trying to complete my assignment and my fucked up brain just can t understand it and i m probably gonna end up failing this course and fuck up the rest of my life just like how i do most of my relationships. tonight i accepted the fact that no matter how hard i try i ll never amount to anything and that i should probably just kill myself. the only thing stopping me honestly is leaving my family behind but i m pretty sure a lot of them think i m a fuck up too anyways. i m a 18 year old male and tonight is the first night i ve cried and ever thought about seriously killing myself. i ll never be anything in life no matter how hard i try. so what s the point   thanks for listening to my rant,2020-10-15 23:19:00
2561,17f here. there is a girl from school who i have been acquaintances with since 7th grade  i m now in 12th grade  but i would like to get closer to her  as i really admire her and we have some things in common. i have texted her on instagram a few times recently and she was always really kind and enthusiastic in her responses  but in the 3 or 4 times i did so  it was always me who initiated the conversation. it doesn t help that she is going across the country for college this fall. how should i go about getting closer to her  i m afraid that she might find me boring or something. i have known her for years and i know that she is a really kind  funny and smart person. i am really shy  but i would still love to be friends with her.   thank you in advance ,2021-05-27 18:58:30
4269,i can be fine one moment  but i ll see something tangentially related to something slightly negative  and then i begin to spiral. i follow the chain to it s conclusion and the only way i can feel is bad afterwards.   they say you need to love yourself before others will love you. but how can something be loved if nobody wants it  people tolerate me  and they show basic  compassion out of courtesy  but when i tell them i d rather be dead they spit pity on me. i hate that.,2020-02-14 09:10:23
6332,i have tried meditation back in 2020  breathe meditation  and i did start small  first from one minute slowly to ten even fifteen minutes. but i was sitting wrong and instead of observing my breath i would breathe manually and i would use music along with it and it was all a mess. i stopped meditating because i fell asleep almost everytime i tried it and i did it for a month. in the early months of 2021 it was the same  and i couldn t hit my new year s target of being able to meditate for an hour by 31rst december 2021. i need to meditate because i have attention problem and maladaptive daydreaming and it has caused so much trouble in my life that at the age of 22  it has completely ruined my life and now i am in my rock bottom.   i know i should meditate but something in my mind keeps putting it away. i know it would benefit me but something prevents me from doing it again and again  everyday. this month  i decided to meditate again  sat properly on a cushion  adopted a bhairav mudra  and tried anapanasati meditation for 20 minutes. started observing my breath but i always get lost in my daydreams while doing that  sometimes i even fell asleep as i felt a little groggy in the afternoons after lunch. tried shunya meditation  the first time it was terrifying but the second time it was harder to focus on the inner void. tried alternate nose breathing mantra for maladaptive daydreaming  discovered it on the internet  and it seems to block my mind from getting distracted. i even discovered walking meditation that grounded me to reality every time i drifted into daydreams. but  i procrastinate on all of them as if there s an inner force that preventing me from doing them. anybody has any advice to establish a meditation routine.   it is difficult for me to find a spot to meditate. i live in a single room with my parents next to a busy street. i only meditate when my parents leave the room for some work  so i am running short on space and also on money.,2022-01-22 22:59:26

188376,hi guys. just wanted to say i recently came out of 5 months of the most painful suicidal depression and anxiety of my lifetime. at the begging  nothing but time could of helped in retrospect. i went on multiple vacations to some of my favorite places  yet all i wanted to do was sleep. many days i contemplated suicide and i could of sworn i saw the  reality  of the world that could never change. i ve been through a little depression when i was younger but i never thought it could be that bad and debilitating. i thought i d be unable to think clearly for the remainder of my life due to previous drug use  long covid  or a narcissistic toxic relationship  but i can confidently say that my brain has mostly healed. therapy  exercise  and social communication with real and warm friends and family have truly saved me. facing my social anxiety head on has also been crucial. i ended coming out of it all being much better person that i can finally respect. i know all you can do the same. stay strong ,2021-12-02 14:37:05
11142,it s often difficult to explain or communicate how we feel about to people  but sometimes the best thing we can do is to recognize first what they do for us and to give those say messages back to them. some people prefer gifts  touch  time  words  or actions in their expression of love so it s best to communicate your appreciation for them through the signals they were interpret. if you experience social anxiety and don t know how to communicate with people  just try one act of love language in your key relationships to build your confidence.   for more information   https   www.mindbodygreen.com articles the 5 love languages explained,2021-12-31 07:03:45

59114,so i don t really know how to start this but i m a 17yr old male and i m not sure if i was raped at a young age. i dont know the exact age but all i know is that it was between the ages of 5 8. ive always had this memory of my cousin forcing me to give oral and me throwing up but for all of my life i thought it was just a vivid dream or whatever. i really am starting to question myself because i remember everything that happened i just don t know if it was in reality or a fucked up  dream  of mine. many years ago i confronted my cousin about this but he just denied it and laughed because i sounded crazy and i ve been denying it really ever since. i really don t know what to do anymore i ve been in therapy for awhile for depression and anxiety but i ve never brought this topic up to my therapist because like i said i don t even know if it really happened. i m not even sure if this plays a part in my mental health problems i really just don t know anymore. if it is a real memory than i suppressed it for way too long. and if it is a real memory than the most fucked up part is that i have a semi good relationship with my cousin nowadays.  sorry for this mess i don t really even know how people are going to  help  i just don t know anymore. this is my first time talking about this. i ve never told anyone in my life besides when i confronted my cousin that one time.,2020-08-25 01:24:01
147280,so today marks the day i went from being twenty three to being six all over again. i m a child of divorce and an older sibling  i ve had separation anxiety and trauma from abandonment  my parents separated and my mom had to move countries . so today my brother  who i ve never been away from for longer than two weeks moved countries to my mom s. i stayed behind with my dad and should be moving in a year or so...  the thing is this happened very quickly  and i didn t expect to react this way  i feel extremely sad  lonely and depressed.   i have depression and anxiety and take meds for this.  i feel like a child  i tried using what my therapist said about explaining this to my inner child  but i can t seem to understand it  i ve never been separated from anyone like this other than my mom  i ve never gone through any breakups or anything like that so this is the very first time i ve separated from someone for an extended period of time.   we are very close  we ve always been there for each other through the ugly divorce  he was a baby   the separation  the bad things  and of course the good stuff. i ve basically helped to raise him too  so i feel like this is taking a little bit of my personality from me haha.  i kind of feel like screaming  quitting my job  running away to a mountain  and just pretty much questioning every single life decision of my life. i feel so extremely lonely and it doesn t really help the fact that i am literally alone at this moment. i kind of feel as if i m in another dimension  or like another reality  i don t know.   can t really talk to friends since i m the mentally ill  sad backstory one and they just wouldn t understand. i also can t get with my psych until next week.   so any tips  i don t even know how to call this  is this mourning  empty nest syndrome or am i just insane...  thanks for reading and sending you all the best in the world,2021-07-09 18:03:07
6687,ok i tried this once and it was a fail  lol. either super boring conversation or creeps.  just looking for an online friend to go through life with. i ve been going through a lot lately and kinda disconnected from the people around me. i just need an outside person to laugh with  vent with  gossip about silly youtube internet drama with.  please don t send me a chat with a brand new profile with no other reddit use or with really creepy questions.   i need a fun  sarcastic  witty friend to match me  lol.   i know this sounds super bratty and high maintenance but if you saw my inbox after the last round  you d understand  lol.,2021-10-01 15:39:56
175046,my depression has been bad recently. when i wake up in the morning i feel super depressed. i struggle to get up. i force myself to eat. however by the time it gets dark  i start to feel better.  i wish i could sleep through the day but i have a restless mind. also nothing seems to distract me either to pass the time. does anybody else go through this  what do you do about it ,2021-10-17 17:04:59
198923,but i m worried. it hasn t helped at all for my depression but a bit for my anxiety and  meltdowns  that i have. i hate how i m getting fat but at the same time it s the only thing that somewhat works  i m on escitalopram as well. i don t know what to do.,2022-01-13 09:08:23

72265,i m not saying i m gonna kill myself. actually i won t because i ve seen firsthand the trauma it caused on my loved ones.  but i am so heavily depressed. i am in a major i hate. and no  i can t change it bc of certain restrictions and family pressures  same reason i can t drop out . i barely do the assignments anymore because i m working towards something i hate. why would i do that  my family expects me to become rich  literally rich  not just well off  and this pressure haunts me every day.   i bottle this all up. i m so depressed. i m so so depressed. i do nothing but cry every day. i sleep poorly. i have no goals anymore. a lot of factors come into play which i won t mention here as this is already longer than i d like.    i m just done. empty. hollow. overwhelmed.   just wanted to tell someone lmao,2020-10-14 17:58:19
1150,this probably doesn t apply so much for redditors as this shows you use the internet  but so many times do i see people a google search away from making their life simpler yet don t. we usually associate this behaviour with our older folks  but i have found that even college students don t do it. many times have i received questions which i simply googled and copy pasted the answer back to them  then appearing as an all knowing being to them.   don t know how to change a tire  don t wait for your mechanic friend to come by this weekend  there are loads of videos online which explain every step in detail  and you ll learn a very useful skill  .  been working on that with my parents and they are now much more efficient and independent when it comes to technology and new things in general. i d highly encourage everyone to promote this as it is simple yet so useful.,2021-03-29 20:52:36
597,so as the title says  i ve been meditating for around 700 days or so. in 2021 i started the headspace 365 course which doubled my usual daily practice of 10 minutes  which is nothing i know   to 20. in this change i ve noticed a definite lack of interest or the loss of benefits of meditation.  i want to stick to 20 minute meditations but do you have any suggestions on how to improve my meditation   whether i need to move away from headspace  tips or even a different form of meditation.  have a great day ,2021-03-02 18:58:11

25783,i have to break up stressful tasks by hours. every little thing i have to do has to be broken up by hours to prevent me from having an anxiety attack. this makes working and living so hard. i m not lazy  i m just trying to protect myself but that s not how it looks to others.,2020-04-28 13:20:18
9539,most of us have been taught to tie our shoes in a way that takes up quite some time  cross the laces  make the loops  etc. . there s a method that ll drastically reduce the amount of time needed   i picked it up a few years ago and you re out of the door a lot quicker  or 30 second longer to snooze every day   .   it takes a few attempts to get it right but the more often you do it the quicker you ll get.  here s a tutorial describing the method    https   youtu.be 6cbtqhq5p28,2021-11-17 15:40:49
81244,i m not  that  religious but i do follow one and by nature believe in an afterlife. recently i ve been having doubts over this belief and a part of me wants it to be wrong because i do not want to continue living in any way  shape or form.   if there was definitive proof that people simply cease to exist after they die and we go back to the void that we were in before we were born i would probably have jumped off a bridge a long time ago. the idea of nothingness and a complete lack of existence sounds so peaceful and perfect to me.   if only i could know for sure.,2020-11-17 20:54:29
5747,as the title suggests  i m curious to find out how long members of this community to feel like they were really  getting  meditation.   i ve been regularly practicing mindfulness meditation for around 2.5 years now  accumulating approximately 10k minutes  as per insight timer and calm apps . i now feel like it s really starting to click for me.   i can effectively sit in equanimity more often and access that part of my mind where i can just simply watch my thoughts without judgement  i can sit in a state that allows me to accept anything and everything to be part of my experience  and ultimately finish my practice feeling more at peace. meditation sets me up for my day  it affords me with the ability to be a better man in many respects consequently.  so  do you feel like you can pinpoint a time when you started to really  understand  meditation and how you actually  do it  ,2021-12-20 07:19:13

8763,if you take loads of photographs over the years  then the date and location of where the picture was taken may be forgotten. we were recently looking through pictures of my deceased dad and my mum had written when they were taken and where on some of them. it was such comfort to see the places he visited in his life and how old he was at the time.,2021-10-26 10:45:51
6358,the reason is because there is so much information to learn in such a short period of time  especially in subjects like biology and engineering. if you re a slow learning and think you won t be able to handle 4 5 classes per semester  go part time. it will take you longer to graduate  but at least you won t fall behind. everybody learns differently. i m a slow learner and it takes me forever to grasp material so if i were to ever go to college for engineering  i know i won t be able to handle more than 2 classes.,2021-08-19 13:50:55

175885,i recently broke up with my ex who cheated on me and moved to another city. long story short  my family took his side and put me through hell.  they are all narcissists  i have lived in this new place for around 5 months now. since then  i have had 5 different jobs. there has been something bad wrong at every one of them. i had to quit them all because i couldn t take it anymore. for example  i worked at an animal hospital as a kennel tech and they started making me do vet tech tasks such as injections  blood work  etc. i also worked at a gym that forced me to work 8 hour shifts alone with no breaks and no proper training. i had to stand the entire time...oh and i had to wear business clothes so i was extremely uncomfortable. those are just a couple of examples. i have asd so jobs can be very tricky for me depending on the environment and how stimulating it is.   i feel so ashamed of myself. i feel worthless. i feel guilty because my boyfriend has been having to pay the bills. my mental health has spiraled.  sleep paralysis  insomnia  weight gain but no appetite    and the fatigue...i d say that is the worst part. the suicidal thoughts are so intrusive and won t go away.  i had two interviews today for a dog grooming trainee position. i think this will be a good fit for me and the interviews seemed to go really well. if you re reading this  please send good vibes so that i can regain my financial independence and work a job i enjoy.,2021-10-20 16:38:12
119858,i am 25 m from the us. i have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety at this counseling place. idk if that was valid. maybe or possibly lol. i ve never reached out to a doctor about my feelings or depression and anxiety. maybe it could ve been a better choice to see a doctor first. i feel like my life has been the same since graduating high school. i want to change but i don t have the energy or motivation to do it. there are days that i would wake up in the morning and just stay in bed no matter how hungry i was i would just lay there and watch youtube all day until i felt like getting up to get something to eat. i have some days that i feel like i should end my life and i think about how i should do it. but i ended up not doing it because i don t want to take my own life. but just having thoughts of it makes me worry. i don t feel like myself anymore and i am not happy. i am always forcing to be happy when im really not and i hate that feeling.  i am always irritable and i work in retail so it s not a good look. even before and during work i am anxious. i also have social anxiety so i get anxious around social situations. i used to like reading but lately it has been very hard to concentrate and understand what i just read. no matter how many times i reread a page i still cannot process what is happening in the book. so that is why i stopped watching anime because of that problem. i think my depression has gotten worse to the point that i have to fake enjoy a tv show. the sad thing is i don t feel joy anymore and it s pretty hard to feel joy. yeah pretty much i have lost interest in everything that i liked. gaming  anime  reading books and manga  drawing and writing it s just unfortunate. all i do is watch youtube and play some games on my days off. or stay in bed and take naps throughout the day. whenever i start on a drawing i think what s the point of drawing when it s gonna take time to get good  idk how to put what i am feeling into words but i m trying. i went to see a therapist counselor before but she was not great. then i just stopped seeking help. and recently i ve been researching about antidepressants and i have been considering on trying them out. i m just worried about the side effects. and yes i think i should seek out a doc first about my mental health before taking more steps next time. so let me know what i should do  or what do tou suggest ,2021-04-03 06:14:12

146905,i don t understand how people do it. my current job involves pressure washing and other less pleasurable activities in the hot sun. crawling through attics that are 110 degrees or more. digging under houses full of rotten wood and sewage. pulling and resetting dirty toilets. basically  if there s any miserable  thankless  literal shit job to be done around a property it s my job to do it.  it didn t have to be this way. i was an all a s student in high school  always made the dean s list in college. i enjoy things like reading  writing  drawing  organizing. i never wanted to be outside as a kid and resented when my father made me go work in the heat. i love air conditioning. i don t understand how people survived without it not that long ago. i could have been a botanist  historian  lawyer  archivist  librarian  teacher  or any number of things that wouldn t have me doing hard labor in the mississippi sun.  this is where i am though. doing the worse jobs in the world where i m concerned  with no end in sight. i wake up angry about it most days. i lash out at pretty much anybody i feel keeps me here  which is everyone i should care about since the people i work most closely with is my wife and father. so i m certainly damaging my relationships as well.  i hate my life. i ve had one job in the past ten years i kinda liked that was basically a filling job in an office. it didn t pay very well  but it was climate controlled and i didn t worry about ruining my clothing every day. i could look in the mirror as i walked out the door and take pride in what i saw. now i see a disheveled  defeated human being wearing little better than rags off to do another day in the salt mines. i hear people complain about their office jobs  how bored they are at their desks. i envy them so much it hurts. i d give just about anything not to have to go do what i do every day.  there s nothing i enjoy about it. nothing. i don t feel like i have any other options though. if this is the rest of my life  i d as soon not live it.,2021-07-08 09:25:43
5220,i got in a kinda fight  idk what the hell to call it  with my boyfriend and two friends last night all over something so fucking stupid i can t even being to describe it. but my bf  laughing the whole way because he was uncomfortable  walked out of the house without shoes or glasses into the rain because he didn t want to talk about it. in turn i feel fucking disgusting about myself and go to talk about it to my friends and start crying and then i go outside to go get my boyfriend who has walked two blocks to the park in the rain in his fucking socks so i do too. i get there with the intention to talk to him because my feelings were hurt and i didn t want to leave things as they were. he s silent. and his only response really is shrugging so we sit there for a while and i can see my own breath. i m a small person in a t shirt and wet socks in the cold so i ask if he wants to go back inside and he reluctantly says yes. we get home and my two friends are talking out their own set of issues. god that a whole other story. and so i m left sitting in my room alone while my boyfriend sits on the couch and my friends are talking on my bathroom floor. some time passes and idk what i m feeling anymore since i ve been listening to sad ass music for like an hour.   tw self harm  i go to  use the bathroom  which was me just trying to get in there so i could cut because i just feel fucking bad and idfk what else to do so i go in and i fuck up my leg a lot and my boyfriend comes and knocks on the door and idk what to do except open it so i do and there s blood all over the floor and running down my leg and i m behind the door with my head down just saying it s fine over and over and he shuts the door and cleans me up and we hug it out and cry and then we go to bed but we never fucking resolved anything. we still haven t fucking talked about anything and it s the next morning and while i feel better i still want to address a bunch of shit and i just don t really know what to do    can anyone help ,2020-02-17 09:27:59

4733,in my previous experience  adding your coworkers and or professor on social media seems to put a lot of restrictions in utilizing my social media.  one time  i posted some random quotes on my facebook profile. during our meeting  my boss somewhat giving me cold treatment and the atmosphere of the room was really awkward. even though my post is totally unrelated to them  it seems that they are really affected by it. after this happened  i stopped posting on my facebook profile  i stopped commenting facebook post during working hours  and i stopped posting my stories during working hours. now  i am thinking of creating a new facebook account due to these restrictions.  furthermore  i ve seen a lot of professors posting in their social media accounts about how their students begging for extensions or grades looking so very pitiful but in reality  these are superficial. his her students frequently post on their social media account  and most of them doing their daily tiktok posting routines. so  if you are a student  make sure that you do not add your professor to your social media account and make your post private so that no outsiders can see what you are posting because professors sometimes stalk their students on social media to verify something.,2021-07-09 00:47:26

1747,detaching our awareness from thoughts is an important practice  it s easy to get overwhelmed by them. this guided meditation can be used daily  for clarity and well being  which naturally arises when we reclaim our awareness from compulsive thinking. we do this by anchoring ourselves in the body  the breath and the present moment  fully accepting our current emotional and mental state  and then going beyond it.  the practice of becoming more conscious of our thoughts ultimately enables us to be more aware of our dreams  and increases the ability to maintain a peaceful mind. in this freedom of mind  we are more prepared to access lucid dreaming  amp  astral projection  and it also helps us to maintain focus and be more grounded in these experiences.  this type of meditation can have powerful and lasting effects on the mind and body. especially when practiced consistently as your mental strength and growing awareness spills into your daily life  and into your consciousness when you sleep.    this is primarily a silent meditation however feel free to play musicbehind it if you wish.    https   www.youtube.com watch v 4hoaszuy1j4  https   www.youtube.com watch v 4hoaszuy1j4 ,2021-05-06 15:43:52

9668,my daughter was born when i was 21  and we both loved doing the helicopter thing where i would spin her around. i would always grab her by the hands when doing this.   one day  she started screaming when i did this with her. i had no idea what was wrong so i quickly got her to the emergency room. it turns out that the force exerted can easily fracture the arm or dislocate the elbow. luckily  it was the latter for her and the doctor easily popped it bach into place.   being young parent  my wife and i were so worried that the doctor would suspect abuse  but apparently we looked worried enough that he knew there was nothing malicious going on.,2021-11-22 19:04:19

402,soooo. i ve  28f  run into the issue that i focused so heavily on education and career over the last 10 years that i let go of friendships that i had back in high school  some honestly were good to let go of  negative influences and some that we just out grew each other  that i now have very few friends.   some background for you all  i went to a catholic all girls private school for both undergrad and graduate school. this was by choice due to scholarships. i was able to earn 2 bachelor degrees in 4 years and then immediately go straight into my grad program and earn my masters in the following 2 years. i lived at home during college and grad school to save money. throughout this whole time i held a full time job that was related to my current career. during grad school while working full time i also completed a clinical internship. so i was incredibly busy. i focused heavily on education work as i didn t want to waste my scholarship dollars as they only were granted for so long.   i am currently in my career which is amazing and i love it  i am a psychotherapist. but i don t work with other therapists since i go the client s home. therefore i do not get the chance to create coworker relationships at an office or chat with anyone obviously aside from the clients and checking in with my clinical supervisor when needed via video chat email phone call. my previous friends have obviously since moved on with their own lives since high school  no hard feelings  we all just went our separate ways .   but now i m 28  i have 2 great friends but they each moved across the country now and then other acquaintances but they re more so my boyfriend s friends and their wives girlfriends that we hang out with which is great but i would love some girl friends again. but how do i go about creating girl friends when my job doesn t have this aspect  are there other ways to go about making friends  covid pandemic friendly ways  i m in the midwest so it s still pretty prevalent here .   i apologize for any formatting and grammar issues  i m on mobile.,2021-02-20 21:20:43
1558,i  f 15  have been in a friendship group for around half a year. it s only been a few weeks where they ve started to become mean . i ve always had quite bad anxiety  mainly about how i look and how other people think of me. i show a lot of emotion and i am a very open person which is why i m always called  dramatic   which i agree  i am most times  but that s just who i am. in the easter holidays they started to use more negatives words towards me and it really took a toll on my mental health. i started analysing everything i do  wrong  and making sure i wasn t doing anything to annoy them. i would use all my money buying them presents and food because i was so scared i would lose them. i feel sort of trapped because if i show any emotion i m dramatic. this group has got me through a lot before now and i love them so much  and leaving them would be an absolute nightmare because there is no other group that i click with. i just can t keep on getting my mental health wrecked. my parents have a very impression obsessed attitude. if i tell them about this  my friends  reputation will degrade in their eyes and i definitely don t want that. i ve tried talking to one person in the group  f 15  and she said she would stop and try to make me feel more included  but so far today i ve been called an annoying bitch  loud  weird  i ve been getting stares and dirty looks. i don t know what to do  but leaving them is definitely not an option. please can i have some advice ,2021-04-22 17:26:39

40028,usually when a friend drops you  there is a valid reason why. or multiple. either they found someone more compatible  you have off putting habits  they re jealous of you  etc.  the list is literally endless. my best friend of 6 years got extremely close with another best friend of mine in the same group  and now she s excluding me from everything. we ve never had any fights or arguments. it s always been great. idk if it has anything to do with the fact that we re seniors  but this is our last summer together and they don t seem to care. i just don t feel good enough because i ve always been there for them. i just can t stop crying.,2020-06-16 18:25:55

2378,i ve been really wanting to take my two dogs on hikes recently since i m fully vaccinated and things are opening back up. however  i m in a new location and don t know the conditions of the local trails and don t know how my girls would currently handle a  5 mile hike since it s been awhile. i realized while i was scouting locations  that if one of them got injured and couldn t walk  i d be sol and have no way to get them back to the car as one weighs 75lbs and the other 130lbs  turns out they make slings for this exact purpose  you can then put your dog in the sling and carry them on your back. obviously it would still be difficult  but it d be a lot more feasible than trying to carry them in your arms. of course it s also helpful to know dog first aid cpr and not push their limits  but i have a lot more peace of mind knowing that i d be able to carry them out of a situation if need be ,2021-05-06 13:57:00

176556,i received my diagnosis of mixed anxiety depressive disorder in 2017 and have been working on it since then.  i had been making excellent strides and thought i was finally ready to fulfill my dream of having a dog.  i moved to a dog friendly apartment and chose to adopt a dog through a local rescue.  this rescue unfortunately did not disclose that the dog had heartworm  a bleeding disorder  severe anxiety  chronic stress colitis  think diarrhea after every slightly stressful event   like a bus going by  or me standing up too fast   and a seizure disorder.  the last four months have been nothing but vet appointments  er trips  cleaning up dog waste  and medications.  i can t leave her home  i can t have people over  and i ve never felt more alone.  i m wracked by guilt over my feelings towards this sweet girl that never asked for any of this  and anxiety that something will happen to her.  i feel myself spiraling  i m financially drained  and i just don t know what to do.  has anyone felt like this after getting a pet  what did you do to make it through it ,2021-10-23 00:54:37

97947,hey all  i m currently entering my third month of full time employment  which is something that i never thought i d be able to handle. ever since i ve entered the work force i have only worked part time as i ve been battling pretty nasty depression for a while and part time work felt like the absolute most i could take. eventually i realized i would need to figure out a way to make a full time job work  whether i like it or not.   i ended up spending a solid couple of weeks planning out how i d compensate for depression while working full time  and i am beyond thankful i did that. had i not utilized these tricks  i would have quit or gotten fired a long time ago. as such  i wanted to share my tips with you guys and hope it will help someone the way it helped me    1. be selective with who you work for. the employer shouldn t only be vetting you  you should be vetting them as well  look for employee reviews and see if you can get into contact with former employees to see what the work environment and management is like before you take the job. if you happen to take the job and feel during the first few weeks that you ended up in a toxic work environment  then leave   don t think twice about it. being stuck in a toxic work environment wreaks havoc on mental health. tldr  don t work for assholes    that leads right into my second point    2. as best as you can  try to have a good amount of money in savings. i ve had to learn this the hard way  i ve started jobs and realized that i ended up working for complete assholes  but couldn t leave because i was desperate for money. having a savings account that can cover at least a year s worth of expenses gives you the ability to immediately leave a job that is detrimental to your mental health while giving you plenty of time to look for another job that is a better fit.  3. at the interview  tell your employer that you occasionally have gastrointestinal flare ups and will sometimes need to take an extra bathroom break or two. unfortunately  a majority of employers company owners  at least in my area  are older  and as most of us know  the older they are  the less likely they are to take depression seriously. telling my employers that i may need extra bathroom breaks gives me the freedom to escape and take a moment if i get overwhelmed with sadness and need to cry. it sucks that i can t be straightforward and say that i need extra breaks because of depression  but i ll take what i can get. if you believe a potential employer might be more understanding then go ahead and be honest with them  but understand that you may risk being labeled as lazy if you do so and may not get the job.   4. have redness relief eye drops and flonase  or a similar decongestant spray  on you at all times    i don t know about you  but there s nothing more uncomfortable than walking out after sobbing your eyes out and knowing that everyone can either tell that you ve been crying or thinks you re high. having eye drops and a decongestant can help you keep it low key  and will make it more comfortable to take a break and cry when you need to.   5. earbuds  earbuds  earbuds    i find that when a task i m given is a little more difficult to do  it s easier for me to ignore my depression because i m focused on my work. but sometimes we have to do tasks that are easy and repetitive  and it s easy to get lost in your head which is the last thing someone with depression wants. having earbuds gives you the ability to listen to podcasts or music to distract and prevent you from spiraling. a majority of employers are okay with earbuds as long as you re still doing the work and it doesn t lower your work quality. if you find that your job isn t flexible with that  even when you re doing repetitive  easy tasks  then try to explain your mental health situation with them and why the earbuds help. if they still don t accept that  then see tip  1.   these are the tips that have helped me  and i hope they help you  best of luck guys   ,2021-01-05 12:57:43
83061,i m currently 27. born with a stutter  always had a shame of talking thanks to it. just a few months ago i was diagnosed with a mild autism. i m completely isolated in my home thanks to a social anxiety. never had a job. dropped out of high school. on top of this i have epilepsy and add. my stutter is the big enemy in all of this  but also my autism. stutter  shame of stuttering and autism is not a good combo. it s like i was told to get social anxiety  feel so outside and since i was 13 i ve hated myself. i was just speechless. i did not know what to say to my friends. i became so mute even to them so they all left me. making this belief that i m something else even stronger.  the scary part about all of this is that i ve been so used to hating myself  having these thoughts and these past 10 years of constant mental warfare and isolation.. it s like.. i m starting to sort of enjoy it. my mind hates it but sometimes it feels like my body enjoys it. it s the feelings i feel so often for so long  and i ve not been happy for like 12 years. i heard somewhere that this behavior can do silly things with your mind  so you end up enjoying what you should not. it s like i want myself to be this huge failure  but at the same time i don t want to. it feels like you are watching your enemy fail but at the same time you realize that is you.  i get help and all that but i don t get help on the level i need. i m looking to increase it but i don t know what will happen after. will some part of me miss these feelings  this hatred ,2020-11-23 07:52:41
714,does it bother anyone else that so many meditation programs and apps talk about meditation as a way to  zone out  or  get away from the world    it bothers me because meditation for me is the exact opposite    it s the way i get back in touch with the universe  back in touch with the things that really matter.  i think being incessantly wrapped up in the day to day stress and busyness is the zone out esacpe  and meditation is the return to reality.  i get that they re selling the relaxing side effect of meditation and that it s marketed this way to draw people in.  but i think it also unintentionally makes meditation seem like something people do to avoid their problems rather than a tool people can use to deal with them.,2021-03-10 13:02:09
168200,note  before people start recommending professional therapy in the comment section i want to say that i am saving money for it and will go once i can afford it.  a few years ago i ve lose someone very close to me that i love very much to leukaemia. after that event i noticed that i cant feel happy without plunging into a very depress mood afterwards. the higher my happiness the lower the plunge.  a year later i also noticed that when something sad happens i usually become jittery  excitable and hyperactive afterwards. for example  my sister s pet died and i was a little attached to it  while i do feel sad about the event and for my sister i later was filled with this uncontrollable energy and happiness.  what is this i am going through   thank you in advance.,2021-09-22 12:43:33

113569,i was in a psych ward  for the first time  after a suicide attempt 5 years ago. as part of the  rehabilitation   i put this in air quotes because psych wards are basically just holding cells   i was supposed to write all of the things i would miss over the next 5 years if i killed myself. i visualized goals and things i wanted to happen and wrote them all down  of course i never believed i would get any of these things  i just had to write something if i ever wanted to leave that prison. 5 years to the day later  i would have missed absolutely nothing. i haven t done shit except survive the last 5 years. nothing worth mentioning. nothing worth remembering. no one will even read this anyway. i wish my attempt 5 years ago had been successful. i wish my second suicide attempt a year ago had been successful. i can t even kill myself correctly. i guess third times the charm,2021-02-26 21:42:38

26432,throwaway account because i have not told anyone close to me about this yet.  i m 19  and i was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. 2  5 year survival rate  i m not dumb  i know i won t make it to there.  all of my life  i wanted to die. i tried to end my life for the first time when i was 8  then 10 times more after that. i ve never appreciated life to the fullest  i was always thinking about the fact that i wanted to die more than anything.  now that i have an official expiry date  i am absolutely terrified. 19 year olds don t get pancreatic cancer  but here i am. i don t want to die anymore.  it s kinda funny how i used to be so depressed because i wanted to die  and now i m extremely depressed because i want to live.  just needed to vent for a bit and looking for some support. i m not gonna spin this around into a  look at how miserable i am  i m the reason why you should want to live     because nobody has time for that  i m just sad i won t get to see my kitten grow up  i m sad i won t be getting married or having kids or finishing my degree.  thank you in advance.,2020-04-30 20:49:51
93953,my first reddit post was years ago on this sub because i was feeling depressed that my sister was getting married and i was so far behind in life. now years later  i still haven t made any life progress or found something to love  and my other sister just called me to tell me she s having a second baby. all i ve wanted for the past 10 years is a child  and i can t seem to find one person to have one with or get in a position to be able to adopt one. so all i felt was personal sadness. i feel like an asshole   again .   i should be happy for her but it just made me really sad on top of being in an already depressed state. i couldn t even hold a conversation with her over the phone  i just avoided her questions and tried to get it over with. i bet she thinks i hate her. we used to be close as kids  and now we barely talk because speaking out loud tires and depresses me. i feel like such a horrible member of my family.  no wonder i m all alone without any company on christmas. i m horrible...,2020-12-25 13:46:24
7504,assuming your not interested in what they are selling  simply say you are not the owner of the property.    the sales person will have no interest in talking with you  since you can t make a buying decision.   it s immaterial that you are the owner  but it works like a charm in closing down the conversation quickly.   your also avoid that guilty feeling in hearing their passionate sales pitch  and then having to disappoint them by your  no .,2021-09-21 17:12:47
97400,i m just self diagnosing here. i don t know what else it could be. i m sad all the time especially when i m alone. i hide behind school  work  when i was employed   and social media  but it never last. my heart aces with pain. it feels like my heart is literally breaking and i can t seem to find away to save it. despite being distracted with my boyfriend and sister i can t help but feel like i annoy or disappoint them. i m constantly put down by everyone in my life weather or not they mean it their words hurt and even their silence hurts.   sometimes i just want to screen and break everything in sight. on new year s eve as i sat around a table playing loter a  mexican bingo  with my family i fought back tears. i felt my heart yearning for an escape. i felt it break. but i sat there and held my tears back as i welcomed the new year feeling completely broken.,2021-01-04 01:42:38
29518,i don t think i have depression but i just feel odd i sleep 10  hours most nights i can t get school work done i struggle to pay attention ever i find it hard to read something as simple as a long paragraph i m not sure what s up with me my grandma died last month but i don t think that massively effected me i went on as normal i have never really been able to focus on my work but it s worse now like i sat down today to do coursework at most i could write a sentence before getting distracted and doing other things.  i don t know if i m depressed but i think there is something that isn t right,2020-05-10 20:25:10
2233,i haven t slept properly in weeks  ate properly in weeks. im starting to feel really awful and my brain doesnt work anymore i cant even focus. i cant stand it anymore  i don t want to live in my fucking skin any longer but if i dont do anything instead of talking about my problems im going to just die off one day  and it ll probably be soon. im so angry all the time  idk what emotions even are  how to use them but i feel all of them all at once right now. fuck everything. i ll end up dead no doubt. i ve tried for well over a decade and im all outta energy. cant do it. can t kill myself  too much of a coward to do it. im just sitting here waiting now. i cant take my own initiative anymore  i have no friends  no motivation  no social life  thanks for coming  goodnight.,2020-02-08 00:31:56
165113,i just have these severe mood swings where i m totally fine and then severely depressed. i just peaced out of work today for no real reason  absolutely astonishing i haven t been fired yet. i ve been  dieting  but then tonight i just buy a package of chips and eat the whole thing. and now i m awake  singing and talking to myself and writing this thing on reddit. i have no idea why i m alive  what is the point of this shit  for real  it s actually kinda funny  it makes me laugh,2021-09-11 02:55:58

144332,everything is boring. i have no drive. no joy in doing anything for more than an hour anymore. i am an introvert that stays in a lot and i love videogames music but they are nothing but pass time these days. i have 1 friend and were both in the same boat. no excitement  nothing is fun  were bored to death depressed af in our rooms all day.  i force myself to go outside and do little things like go to the arcade or shop but i always end up in the same place  in my room  depressed and unexcited from life. thanks for reading  all replies i appreciate,2021-06-29 01:55:40

159962,so i m now studying in university  just after i finished my school  but i think i cant study here cuz it s too hard for me and maybe i ll be soon expelled. i cant study in another university cuz it was a fortune to study here free and noone s gonna pay for another university  so even if i find what i like  i cant change. the only thing i think i ll be able to do is to be a poor  but i dont wanna die like that. all i have now is my parents who arent going to support me all the time since i m 18 already. they arent gonna kick me out  but they arent gonna pay for any university for me since they dont even have money for it. i also dont have anyone who can support me.,2021-08-23 12:57:52
8358,pretty self explanatory. run your furnace for a few hours make sure everything lights and burns correctly  change your air filter  check your vents for build up  etc. if you don t know what you re looking for there are plenty of videos out there to help. if something isnt working properly its better to know before you need your heat. it will give you time to potentially fix it yourself or schedule a repair. if you wait and end up needing to use an hvac emergency service it will cost you a ton.,2021-10-16 10:24:06

71099,i  f15  have been feeling depressed for about 2 years  feeling suicidal for about a year. i probably have a narcissistic mother and a mentally ill brother  in a bad way  like a future serial killer .  i have been planning my suicide for over half a year  and today i was watching some old green day videos  my favorite band. and billie said  we are alive     and... i dont know. it kind of dawned on me. i am alive  and i have nothing to lose  i am already in therapy  i should try. i think i do want to live. its a small thing but somehow something clicked.  i guess im going to try for a little longer,2020-10-10 16:47:47
186311,so  every couple of months i get these weird episodes of depression. it usually starts with my motivation disappearing and a very heavy feeling in my limbs. after that i usually start getting lots of suicidal thought and i try to come up with the best way  that would definitively kill me  and wouldn t leave me in a damaged body in case of failure. then i lie down and start crying my eyes out and after an hour i m almost back to normal. there is no apparent cause or trigger  and this only happens once in a few months  but it s gotten me very close to killing myself. could this be a sign of some kind of a depressive disorder    amp  x200b   p.s  i know this is very selfish of me  and i m probably just talking about my personal problems when nobody really cares about me  so you don t really have to reply  and you can just delete my post if you want. i apologize,2021-11-25 08:23:29
6069,when i first started out i grasped everything and was really good. i was focused and diligent. but because it s the busy time of the year i ve been feeling really burnt out and exhausted at work. i can t focus at all.   it s been affecting my ability to work.  a lot of clients are unsatisfied with me. i lash out at them and just don t treat them that well.  i make a lot of mistakes and barely get anything done throughout the day. really stupid mistakes  like mixing up numbers or categorizing things incorrectly.   the only reason my boss hasn t fired me yet is because he has yet to find someone else to replace me and he needs to hold onto anyone he can given it s been busy.    to be 100  frank i d be happy if he were to fire me  as i feel guilty for taking money from him because i just can t work.   tldr  i can t focus at work and i feel really burnt out.  have you gone through something similar  has meditation helped  if not what would you recommend that i do ,2022-01-09 06:20:06
2843,this is really common where i am  australia  and it gets annoying hearing it for the millionth time. if someone is new to the hobby it can really detract from their excitement.   just imagine buying a new car and then constantly being told  oh i know x who drove a car once and they were in a bad accident .   applies to any hobby that has inherent risk  really. even if you have kind intentions it tends to come off as patronising.,2021-05-18 22:44:42

57795, is my mind broken  is it possible to fix it  im 16 and have been questioning reality and existence for months now  after experimenting with acid. i feel like i am going crazy and keep having panic attacks and breakdowns. i met with a counsellor yesterday and told him about my existential dread. he just said i m  highly sensitive .but it fucking sucks  my thoughts are just racing anxiety all day.,2020-08-19 22:11:39
5856,yesterday  some friends and i got stuck inside due to a thunderstorm. my friend lit a candle and decided to meditate on it.  next thing  when i closed my eyes   i could   very clearly and steadily   see this beautiful  glowing bindu  dot    white on the center  surrounded by thin  colored rings  the first was orange  then red  then green  then violet   i m not sure about these two last colors  surrounded by pitch black darkness.  i ve only ever seen this described in tratak  kashmir shaivism  meditation on pranava  aum .  it didn t seem or feel like a purely visual phenomena either   i even opened my eyes for a bit and when i closed them i was able to maintain this for some minutes  then i got too excited in the mind and it faded.  any idea what this bindu means if anything at all ,2021-12-28 09:32:45
49368,i m living a hard period of my life for more than 4 years now. i have already seeked help in therapy  and will keep searching  but it really hasn t helped me so far. i am in the vicious circle where failures in my life keep haunting me everyday  and everything just keeps getting worse  anxiety and low self esteem . i want to change and i think there is a chance  therefore i know i m not depressed  but emotional pain is making changes impossible.  i often smoke marijuana and that is slightly relieving   but only in the short term. i think that any substance that could help me to  feel less   even if that would affect good feelings too  which are rare anyways  could be a great help to take back control of my life. is there any kind of drug that could help me achieve this  i don t want antidepressant because i m quite sure that would be an overkill...,2020-07-18 21:43:29

54708,so  i have been dealing with a lot. this is the first time i have been saying it out loud to anyone outside of my college i got suspended from my college for a year. it wasn t anything unusual  everyone in my college does that but i had the god forsaken luck to get caught. my suspension was supposed to end this november but even though an open secret  i constantly keep getting anxiety attacks about it.   then  i finally gathered the courage to break off a situationship with a narcissist  seven months ago. but i am still very much dealing with it. the flashbacks of the excruciating trauma keeps overlapping with the anxiety attacks about my academic life s uncertainty.   lastly  i have been living home for the past five months since the lockdown and my parents are in a deep financial trouble and any attempt to get out of it gets thwarted. my sibling and i both are still financially dependent on them so it s been taking its toll on us as well.  amongst all these  i am tired all day everyday. i have cut off contact with anyone from my college as it reminds me of everything. my parents don t know about it so i am afraid all the time they will find out. i keep trying to be patient but i feel like i am losing it. i feel disgusting all the time  i feel like a failure and want to cry all the time. i just want to feel normal again.,2020-08-08 06:16:18
195469,i  20f  moved in with my boyfriend  20m  in july 2021 and absolutely everything has become too much to deal with. i have had agoraphobia since 2018 and before moving out it was genuinely improving i was starting to get better then bam  i move out and it becomes paralysing. i am disabled by it now. i think i m also autistic and the reason why everything has gotten worse due to the unfamiliarity and break of routine however me and my bf have also had a constant string of bad luck. we had a break in  then a rat infestation  then a leaking shower  then a leaking sink  then our only money source gets threatened to stop etc. i miss my mum s house i miss my bedroom.  i feel so hopeless that i want to go and do a load of stuff like get a tattoo  travel etc then either feel better or kms  but i m agoraphobic so i can t even do that. i can t do anything. i sit in bed all day every day. my bf also struggles with depression so we find it hard to comfort eachother all the time. so it s like why am i living through something that honestly feels like torture when i get absolutely no joy from it    ig my question is how can i find something to enjoy when i m too anxious to go outside and too depressed to do anything inside ,2021-12-30 20:30:28
3262,i ve had tons of cats and by far this is the easiest method. they aren t just scared of the water  they also get startled by slipping everywhere and not having anything to grip. they can keep their grip on the wet towel and basket and won t squirm as much or try to jump out. this can also work with dogs ,2021-05-29 14:56:33

110640,it feels like forever that i ve had these thoughts.  each night i struggle to sleep. i just keep feeling helpless and useless.  i am constantly worrying that something bad is going to happen and i just can t escape it.  it s very overwhelming  the feeling of having everything weighing down on me. i genuinely don t know what to do anymore.  i have some ok days but then it flips suddenly and i just feel like i am nothing.  everything either makes me anxious or irritates me and i really don t want it to anymore.,2021-02-17 19:48:22
5499,you could say i have an addiction to new people. i absolutely love talking to people and i love learning new things about them and their interests. i am also an open book and a verbal punching bag if you d like to vent or let off steam. i do actually care about you and i would love to help in any way i can.  i also just like to talk  maybe too much. i can talk about anything. i do my best to keep a conversation lively and interesting  and i do appreciate the same in return  so if you plan on sending one or two words please don t message me. i get excited when i see a message  but when it devolves into  cool  and  what s up  i immediately become sad  so please don t make me sad.  as for my interests  i love music  movies  outdoors  running  hiking  folklore  spooky things  halloween  coffee  travel  mountains  oceans  true crime and a ton more that i don t have time to type out.  i get a lot of responses so if i don t respond right away it s because i m managing them all  most become nothing very quickly so i can weed the dull ones out.  so if you d like to chat  send me a message and tell me what song you ve had on repeat lately    ,2021-08-29 09:26:28
61858,i broke up with my ex in february yes it s one of these posts  but the shit just hurts  i am still in love with her which i guess is ironic because when we broke up i didn t feel anything towards her  i think i actually did but was just shutting down over the pain that happened  i broke up with her and i hate it i fucking hate it every day  why did i just shutdown emotionally and have things end  it shouldn t have been that way and i think about her everyday. people say i need to move on or find someone else but i don t want someone else  she brought out the best in me and we grew a lot together. it hurts because i don t think she would ever take me back and if she did then how would we sort things out  that s what hurts the most and knowing that it probably won t be a thing just crushes me to my core. i dream about being back with her a lot and think about it a lot which probably causes the pain to deepen but i don t want anyone else. i can t even talk to anyone else about it because they would tell me i m an idiot and to move on.,2020-09-04 12:21:55

8662,the objective of the life game is  to survive   and what matters in life is how you choose to survive.   someone will decide   1. let me go and be a farmer. i will plant to get what to eat. the rest i will barter for timber to build my house and buy cattle.   2. another will decide   let me go to school. i will learn wisdom and come back and build for the farmers in exchange for food and timber to build.   3. another one will say  let me join army. i will protect my people from enemies and in exchange i will earn what to eat and where to sleep.   4. the 4th will say  let me go to far lands and bring things and sell to farmers  to elites  to guards  and in exchange i will also survive.   5. another will decide   i dont have a land to farm  money to go to school  energy to join army  and capital to travel to far lands. let me remain here and help any farmer or builder who needs help.   6. yet another will decide   people want to be happy after work. let me dance and sing for them. i will also survive from the little they give me.   7. and the last one will say  i am born poor  but i am destined to be great. let me invest my time in creating some thing that no one has ever seen and i will earn from it to become very rich and more powerful.   all these people will survive but will have different levels of wealth. wealth is just a measure of how well you survive.  it s the road you choose to take the makes all the difference in life.  nothing less nothing more.    oracles of a witness,2021-10-24 04:36:34
86715,struggling with depression and it has gotten worse these past two years constantly getting rejected after having interviews. i m just wondering how people with depression were able to get a job  i also struggle with anxiety so that s a big factor in struggle with interviews but i honestly feel so crappy about myself that i really can t find the strength to try to impress people in interviews and pretend to be a cheerful person when i m not. how can i overcome this ,2020-12-04 17:50:51
188982,i think i am awful. i think i can t do  learn anything. i think anyone in the world can do anything they want  except me. i m crying on a cruel depressing episode  i ve been crying too much since some months ago. i feel numb  i feel useless.   i ve always felt in this way  but people just said  and still say  it s time  that i need time to go through this. i ve felt shitty and useless my whole life. i think im wasting my life but i can t do otherwise at the same time. everybody enjoys at least sth in his life  except me. i don t feel pleasure for anything  just wake up because i have to. evrything seems awful and exhausting. i feel increadibly tired all day long  that my body is heavy and it s difficult to even stand up out of bed. i just wanna feel good or pleasant for just one second in my life.  i just wanna die. i don t know. sorry for posting. i just needed to say it.,2021-12-04 17:49:04
180347,i would say the biggest problem is self blaming and this huge guilt.   i ve been dating my bf for over 1year. before i met him i was okay. i really didn t have any depression  however i got a mild depression after covid  i assume maybe feeling stuck and not knowing what to do for long time made me depressed.   also before i met my current bf  i have lost my ex by overdose. once i started a new serious relationship i started getting triggered.  feeling loved was trigger  being in a relationship was trigger  looking at his face and saying i love you was trigger. but i have been working on this.  after few month  i got pregnant and had an abortion. i was foreigner and still young so that was the best decision i could ve made. after an abortion my depression got worse i also got anxiety issue. i had panic attack occasionally and started self harm. i was on medication for months and everything kinda got back to normal.  recently i had to make a big change in my life such as moving out to whole different city  change my job  moving in with my bf. and i have not been doing well.   i am kind of worse than before. most importantly i can find myself sad and depressed most of the time  i m trying not to but sometimes i can t help.and everytime i looked at my boyfriend i just felt awful. because i know my mental health would affect him. i m always fighting the voice in my head. its telling me like hey look at you  who wants to date a girl like you  you are always sad. always depressed. always crying.   i m telling myself that i m not broken  just stuck. and i will be okay. actually i ve been making slight progress however i feel like being in a relationship when my mental health is not stable is not the best idea. and it s killing me.   i considered breaking up up sadly i love him too much and he loves me a lot too. i wonder how you guys handling relationship with depression  how work on self blaming and feeling guilty   thanks for reading this ,2021-11-04 12:12:15
10490,you should also figure out what gets you excited to write. booktubers have helped motivate me  watching people talk about one piece works incredibly well for me  but i also can t write while listening to music  which is what a lot of other people do.  if you struggle to write when you are at your peak  then try other things.,2021-12-15 09:48:33
9130,working in a restaurant most of my career  it s required to use a non slip mat. the boards and mats never give any cussion while cutting. my wrist is usually a little sore by the end of the day. i realized a yoga mat would prevent sliding and give a little cussion. cut them to size or cut one to match your largest board.,2021-11-04 23:18:17

3994,so the past few weeks i was so frustrated on how to achieve peace and how i do in meditation. i often question my self if im doing right. yes i can observe what is going on in my mind the mental chatter  the mental noise. but i havent notice the mind that tells me  this is not working    you should do something else . etc etc... the thing i realized is i havent notice this desires because it doesn t  simply exist in the mental noise the voice that speaks in my mind rather its my subconcious part that tells me this. man this was really hard to spot.,2021-08-31 11:11:14

122361,i ve talked with others about this to some extent  but i don t know what to do. i really  really want to be good  and to do good   and i don t know what to do here or what i can do to change this. i m scared that this will prevent me from ever being good  period. i realize that sounds irrational now  but i m just really scared.   amp  x200b   throughout my teenage years  i ve done bad things   things that i regret daily. things that run through my head pretty much throughout each and every day. i hate who i am and i ve been trying to work to be better  but i m scared that this is an impossibility. i feel like i ve changed from who i was then  but i m scared that i haven t.   amp  x200b   first and foremost  when i was 15  i was in a lewd roleplay online with someone several years older than me. i feel like this was wrong in every aspect  and it makes me uncomfortable to think about  but i worry that i am at fault here given that i was also a party engaged in this and doing it at all. i really  really regret ever participating in this.   amp  x200b   from here on out  off and on i got further involved in nsfw things online   things i really regret ever participating in. another thing that took place that   while not inherently sexual or anything of that nature   was that i entered into a friendship with someone a couple of years older than i was. in retrospect  i feel that this friendship was inappropriate  as they took a great interest in me and in retrospect thinking about it  the dynamics were uncomfortable. i m not exactly sure whether or not this would be termed grooming  but the friendship in retrospect makes me feel very uncomfortable. on top of this  our last interaction ended with the person in question coming onto me   so i m not sure whether or not this has colored my feelings about this friendship in retrospect. what i regret the most  however  is something i did in december of 2018  i was seventeen  and i catfished someone. i did it only for one day  but this is hardly any kind of excuse for what it is that i did. it was done on twitter  and although i deleted this account after one day  it still runs through my mind each and every day. the guilt is enormous   and i know i deserve it.   amp  x200b   i feel like  selfish  doesn t begin to cover these things. i feel like i manipulated a person in the second example i gave  and i feel like the same took place in the former example.that s what terrifies me the most   that i may have very well hurt people in my doing this. it scares me that i ve ever done this  and i regret it every day  some days i only think about it once or twice  but other days  it s constantly running through my mind to the extent that i don t even want to get out of bed. this is pathetic   but i m not sure what to do.   amp  x200b   this isn t the kind of person i want to be. i want to be someone worth being proud of. i m really  really afraid of disappointing the people i love  and i don t want to let them down. i feel like i m constantly split in two  like the part of me that ever wants to do good and the part of me that s trying to grow and change is a  fake . i m scared of being a manipulator  or deceitful  or predatory.   amp  x200b   i feel like i have changed and grown from this person   i am trying to be a good person   at least  the best person that i can be. this may sound facetious  but i ve been earnestly trying to do better. what scared me most about all this for a long time is that i identify as asexual  i genuinely feel like i am  but for the longest time i was scared that i was a fake  because i felt like there was a disconnect between who i feel i am and these things i did.   amp  x200b   i feel more grounded and more in touch with my sexuality... but the fact that i wasn t before is no excuse for what i did do. i ve been trying to change who i am  and i feel like i ve grown a lot in the last two years as a person  and i ve tried to change who i am and these things. but i m scared  too  that this is an impossibility   that i won t be able to make any lasting or meaningful changes to myself and be who i wish to be  and that i really won t be able to grow from this  and instead that i m always going to be the weirdo that did this.   amp  x200b   it really  really scares me   i don t want to be a predator  or a manipulator  or a creep. i m constantly afraid that i m truly and genuinely evil  and that if anyone knows that i did these things they would see me as a fake   that they wouldn t want me as a friend  and that they d reject me completely. and the thing i m more afraid of is that i feel that i would totally and completely deserve it.   amp  x200b   i don t want to be a creep. i feel like i ve changed and am changing since i did these things  and i ve left these people behind   i ve pretty much cut down my online presence to nil  and i ve been trying to work on myself both mentally and socially.. but i m worried i m marked forever by this  and that i deserve to be. i really don t know what to do  but i want to continue to try and be better. i m scared its too late for it but. i really earnestly hope it isnt.   amp  x200b   what should i do  i m not sure whether or not i m just venting or what  but.. i don t know what to do. i feel like i m at my wits end.,2021-04-15 00:24:45
6116,hi  i have some experience with concentration and i know some of you do too. let s talk.    relevant stuff about me.  i did concentration pretty solid for 6 years. then i did concentration mindfulness for about 10. these days i pretty much just do mindfulness.  when i do concentration i like to use the tactile sensation of breath in the tip of my nose as my object. i ve experimented with a few.  concentration meditation enhancers that have worked for me   vegetarianism  hatha yoga prep  fasting  sleep deprivation and a peaceful lifestyle.  jhanas  i think i hit maybe the third.  doing concentration seriously   6 times a day   fasting  does amazing things to my reality. and that goes quadruple if i combine it with mindfulness.    ask us anything    friendly graphic  https   redd.it s1heba ,2022-01-11 13:11:48

56038,i think that s the most painful thing. i thought it would bring us together and  for the first month or so  it did. but all in all  people don t care about your physical health enough to wear a mask or stay at home  people don t care about your relationships enough to check in  reach out or keep in touch  our government doesn t give a shit about anyone. i guess it was like this before 2020  but i always made excuses for people. i m so exhausted from the loneliness and having nothing to look forward to. i gave up months ago trying to get people to do the bare minimum by just opening their laptops and catching up. i can t even count on one hand how many friends would show up  even virtually  if i really needed them. i bought all of these games you can play on video chat  bought a pro zoom account  made numerous attempts to get friends to catch up  but it was like pulling teeth and i realized i was asking them to do the bare minimum and they still weren t interested. as it s an almost impossible thing for me to do  i ve decided to delete all my social media and stop reaching out and trying to connect with friends other than my best friend whom i talk to almost everyday. i need to keep my depression in check for my daughter as i think she is the only thing giving me my will to live these days. there is no pill strong enough to pull me out of this hole i m in  i ve tripled my anti depressants slowly over the past 6 months . i m working on home projects and working out everyday  but i still cry myself to sleep every night. so i don t know if this will help  but i have realize there are things i can control  my actions  and things i can t  my friends  actions inaction  so i m taking control. my work done  i need to be a strong parent and partner. we ll see how this goes.,2020-08-13 07:33:23

74351,as of this year 2020 has been a really hard year. i m  32m  going through a divorce  i thought everything was going well. however when we were around her family they would always make very subtle hints towards divorce. they poison dripped our marriage. come to find out after being together for 8 years  she would tell her parents everything about me and all the vulnerable things that happened to myself during my childhood. i lost all trust for her after that  i tried so hard to get past that but i couldn t  i kept telling her things that i d want to do together with just her and i and then her father would be talking about it. so i just couldn t do anything alone with her  her parents always had to be around. they are super codependent on my stbxw and she is a very passive person who loves to please people. i ended up being forced out of our house and was homeless for awhile  found a place. her parents are living with her now. should have never wasted my life with that person. she would never stand up for me or our marriage against her family. it s just really bothering me because we we re compatible until her toxic family fucked up everything. anyways i m definitely depressed  i m broken  she blames me for everything. i literally hate myself  i just lost my job to make this year much better than it already is  of course im looking for another job considering i don t want to be homeless again. am i suicidal  no more than any other human in my situation. i talk to people who don t know me out in the world that don t know anything about me like nothing is wrong  happy and smiling but in reality i m just trying to figure out how stay alive. i don t sleep much  barely eat  i ve lost weight definitely not a bad thing on that one. i have no friends left that i haven t pushed away during the marriage. family lives far away. i m fucking alone literally.,2020-10-23 22:40:10
79579,i can t fucking focus on anything. it takes me f o r e v e r to read a single page of material i should already know. i m so hopelessly behind in school. i am aware of that and yet i m still lying here in bed not studying and being completely fucking useless. i dumped all my laundry on my bed this morning because i thought that would get me to finally fold it and put it away. nope. literally lying under a pile of laundry right now. folding laundry is the most mindless thing on the planet. there is no good reason i shouldn t be able to take care of it. it s pathetic. i feel like i m brain damaged in some way. there s some part of me that remembers what it s like to be smart and driven and now i have to dredge up all my energy for the day to write a post on fucking reddit  that s just unacceptable.  i fucking hate this. i can t imagine living another 60  years like this. every time i sit down to try and get some work done  i get distracted thinking about hanging myself in my closet. it s incredibly compelling. eventually i feel like i ll snap if i stay in my room any longer so i go out and just start walking for hours. i guess that s better because even if i m fantasizing about laying down in the middle of traffic  i wouldn t actually do it for fear of traumatizing some poor bus driver. but i also feel like it s just delaying the inevitable. like sure logically this episode will end eventually but how is that supposed to make me feel better when i know the depression is just going to come back again at some point  how much of this am i supposed to be able to take ,2020-11-12 21:43:01
82015,i couple of years ago i was diagnosed with gad which stands for generalized anxiety disorder  i have always been a sort of anxious kid but these past couple of days i haven t felt normal at all and it s worrying me to death  it feels like i m going crazy and i ve been reading about something called depersonalization and i m afraid i have it. it feels like i m going to have a panic attack  i just wish i could feel normal and happy like i used to when i was little. will this ever go away and will i ever feel normal again  ,2020-11-20 03:29:18
29242,i don t really know how to write my feelings but here we go. i apologize if it s kinda tough to read. im a 22 year old male and i have been so lucky to have been raised by two amazing  hardworking and loving parents. they ve always been able to provide me and my siblings with everything we d need to be successful in life. i m not sure what s wrong with me but i just can t seem to do anything right. i barely graduated high school  i can barely hold a job for more than a year and when i end up unemployed  it takes me forever to find a new one because i just don t have the motivation to apply. i have zero motivation to do almost anything and i have genuinely no idea what i want to do with my life. i m in community college for a career path i don t even know if i want to do anymore and i m struggling so hard to find motivation to do schoolwork. i failed a class this and last semester. i feel unbelievably bad that my parents have done so so so much for me and i m just this useless 22 year old who barely even has the motivation to practice good personal hygiene. i cry and worry constantly about my future. my finances are in ruins at the moment. i just feel like my life is just falling apart in front of me and i can t find any motivation to do anything about it.,2020-05-09 21:17:12

91333, i made a post on another sub here.. my intention was the guy i hooked up with messaged me again. i just can t sleep. i prefer considering it as hook up than raped. i don t know what would i feel if i was raped then i didn t even know it myself.  this was my title   not really seeking an advice. i just wanna share what happened to me with the guy i hooked up last month   me and this guy met through a dating app. i asked him what s his looking for on this app then he said relationship. i said  i am as well. cool. i don t really expect that much because it is tinder and we re still both young.. we re just at the same age.   he asked me to go out then i thought it would be a decent date because he said he was looking for a relationship i assumed he ll be a decent guy. i said yes  after two times of rejecting him due to conflict schedule. when we went out we brought drinks then he drove us to a park. he said we ll just talk.. talk my ass  we re in the park inside his car around 10pm and no one was there.. talk my ass. he started touching me and i said no  because i didn t plan to hooked up. if he could have just tell me earlier then maybe i would consider it. he told me i ll give him a head and then i told him i don t want to.. but he already slowly pushing my head but then i said  you can t force me  because he won t let me go home and there s no public transportation near the park. i have no choice because he was really so persistent. i just wanna go home at that time. before he even dropping me off  he drive opposite way from my way home and asking for another one.   after he dropped me off  i didn t text if he s home or not  didn t even bother to thank him for dropping me off. after two weeks  he s messaging me again. fuck you.   well at least i have learned my lesson.   end of the post   he found out i m virgin that is why he wanted to do anal. i said no. whenever i could feel his thing down there  i looked at him and said  just please don t put it  i kept telling him that.   even i m a virgin  if he told me earlier and being honest  i might consider to hook up with him but i didn t really planned it. i thought really it was just a decent date.  i shouldn t have made a post.,2020-12-17 04:11:12
12125,when i first downloaded venmo back in the day i didn t think it would last long   i would use it much so i made my pic a bunny with its tongue sticking out. this has made it easier for people to make sure they actually are sending money to me.   when you search someone s name in venmo a ton of similar usernames pop up and trying to figure out if that little picture is actually the person you are sending too isn t easy.   much easier to find the bunny with its tongue sticking out then the guy with brown hair.,2022-01-26 09:27:47
6468,i recently started doing 10 minutes of guided meditation every day  10 days so far . the reason why i began meditating is because i heard that the practice can provide great insight into the nature of my mind and provide unique subjective experiences. so far  i have not experienced anything unique or interesting. i just try to focus on my breath and notice thoughts as they arise  but i can never really be sure where my focus is. it seems like only a small part of my focus can be on my breath. my focus could also be completely somewhere else and i would not even realize it. i don t really see how it s possible to fully focus on the breath or be aware of thoughts as they arise. every time i try  i feel like a dog chasing its own tail. am i doing something wrong  is it common to experience absolutely nothing from meditating as a beginner  if so  how many sessions are required to feel a noticeable difference in experience on average ,2022-01-31 02:49:58
4611,i don t do well in one on one setting but i do okay in small group settings. i was wondering if anyone feels the same way and would like to start a small group of maybe like 6 7 people  we could get to know each other and what not. i think discord would be the best place to do so  we could even have movie nights or hangout in voice chat ,2021-08-02 01:58:00
137185,hey guys   i suffer from depression for probably a decade now. a few years back  when i was 19 i smoked weed for the first time  needless to say it was an incredible experience.  a couple of years later when my military service was over i started smoking more and more weed to deal with the countless problems i have. it helped my insomnia  my ibs  my anxiety and my depression.  the more i smoked the more i was dependent on it. it gotten to the point where i d smoke 4 5 times a day and just let months go by while not really doing anything with my life.  until i just stoped smoking during the day a couple of month ago. which means i have to deal with my ibs and anxiety every day. it s extremely difficult but not as overwhelming as the depression i feel every night. i kept smoking every night to numb down the pain and it usually works.  i ran out of weed recently and i m considering taking a break. problem is  it s too fucking hard. the past couple of nights have been extremely overwhelming with loneliness and despair. i don t remember anymore what it was like to feel normal and not having all this darkness inside of me every fricking evening. i won t ever hurt myself  i think  but every night i wish i was never born.  don t know what to do anymore...,2021-06-03 14:44:51

79719,it has been a long year. i ve been working at a job that changes my responsibilities every week  overworks me  and treats me like i m not human. i m trying to get into grad school to get out of this job and make a better life for myself but the odds are making it seem like that s not going to happen for another year or so and i can t take this job anymore. little things set me off because they make me feel like nothing can go right. i got a dress in the mail and it was the wrong color and i had a crying fit for an hour because it just felt like the last straw in a day where life just continuously slapped me in the face. i feel like i can t get a win in life and every little thing that goes wrong feels like one more weight on the pile of problems which is my life. i m extremely hardworking  a good person  and i ve gotten the short end of the stick my whole life for no reason. i know i m playing into a victim role but i keep trying to get out of it through hard work and it doesn t change anything. i m just burned out and i don t know how to get through this anymore.  i m on meds but they don t help me. i have medical bills i m still paying off with the money i work my ass off to earn only to lose it all in one medical procedure. i only get out of bed every day because if i don t earn money i ll be broke in no time and forced to move back in with my parents. i am not actively suicidal but i need a reason to live again.,2020-11-13 10:17:11

94853,i am a really lucky person. my parents love and support me  i have a robust and emphatic friend group  and there are so many things in my life to be happy about. but the past year has been...so hard. at first i felt lonely and isolated because i couldn t see my family or friends for obvious reasons. i felt totally devoid of motivation to do the things i enjoy doing. i had an awesome job this summer  one that i love doing. but it was so hard to even make myself go every morning  and i felt like i just floated through every task. i was able to address that with some colleagues and learned that they were also experiencing pandemic fatigue  which helped. soon after  my relationship with my roommates  two of my closest friends since the beginning of college  imploded. i ended up moving out  and the absence of those relationships still hurts. my new apartment is pretty nice  there are cats  . yet  a few days after moving  i got dumped  kind of for the first time  in a really unpleasant way. over the past semester there were times where things felt good  even fine. the news of the vaccine successes has made me feel so relieved  mom got vaccinated last week thankfully . but i still don t feel remotely like myself. i finally got to go home for thanksgiving after testing negative quarantining and i spent so much time avoiding my family. i think i was in bed 18  hours a day. i used to be a person who was so driven and capable. someone who could follow through with plans and goals  and relished being productive and active. now i m scared that i ve slipped into this irreversible habit. i don t know how to find my way out of this  and i feel like i don t even deserve help because i am so privileged in so many aspects of my life. i know this isn t how it works but it just adds to this holistic feeling of inadequacy  that i can t hold it together even with all the luck i ve been given in life.  sometimes i think about wanting things to go away me to go away but i know i could never do that to my parents. before i left home  my dad just came into my room crying  because he was so worried and upset about how... lackluster i ve become and wants me so badly to be just happy. i have therapy tomorrow and i know things are going to get better eventually but i just feel so so bad right now.,2020-12-27 22:44:47
1174,i know  i know  people say  meditation teaches you the questions are irrelevant  . i ve searched old posts in this sub. this might be totally the wrong place to ask for that reason.  and i see that most nights when i go to sleep too. i go to the real world  and there i think  why am i so stressed out about that world that isn t even real  why am i so desperately trying to see the light in that world  and get answers to my questions when it s not even a real world     problem is  down here in this lowly not real world  that doesn t mean anything. it doesn t help. i m still trapped down here for 16 hours a day. i know the whole time this is not real  i really go my whole days with this knowledge   but that doesn t mean i can control it. that doesn t mean i know how to override the game. my world is a prison where money is the thuggish warden who rules my life.   the old  the questions are irrelevant  doesn t help when my landlord s kicking us out  selling the house  i can t afford to rent my own place  and the only options that have presented themselves are  a joke to me. it doesn t help when i fear i m going to be jobless soon due to a ridiculous working situation where something s gotta give   this might be a not real world  but when the man comes to cut off your electricity  you can t just say  i know you re not real. don t touch that box. i banish you from my existence  . or can you   the people i live with twice thought they could not pay their share of the power  thinking i d somehow sort it. i was worse off financially than them  and actually going slightly hungry at the time. the power got cut off a second time before they saw  you really have to pay for power .    so  can we put aside the condescending  i m so spiritual  talk to discuss things you ve found that help when you need answers  especially methods that don t require discipline.  for little things i find i can put it down  let go  confident the answer will come  and it does  because i have no serious attachment to it. if it s not money food shelter  it doesn t matter so much. for big things  they swirl round my head in anguish  and i just can t seem to let them go.  there s always one default  no decision option that stands out among all paths for me  and that s the one i always take  short of answers. it doesn t give me an easy life.,2021-04-07 19:52:24

54345, possible trigger warning   i ve been working at a call center for a year and a half doing over the phone tech support.  i won t preach at anyone but i was doing things like meditation  dopamine fasting  exercise like hiking  going to the gym and running. i was much more intune with my christian faith.  while i had  have  a new vehicle  2019 so still newish  i feel miserable.  i am constantly trying to pay off debts from a hernia surgery that i had while working at a retail store.  i live with my blood grandparents  parents  who legally adopted me.  lately i have been having violent thoughts  i feel like i have gone back to that undisciplined lifestyle and i put on weight. i had to leave two friends behind  one was allowing hardcore drug addicts  heroin  meth  to live with him  i always felt unwelcome there  not by him but the people he had staying there.  i have recently reconnected with some highschool friends   xbox buddies   i guess what i m saying is  i don t like how my life is and i feel like it s too late to change the direction i am going.  i have tried self help books like 12 rules for life  and levi lusko s i declare war  i was reading my bible a lot more than i have been  and because i had completely stopped drinking and using illegal drugs by choice  i felt very connected to my higher power.  i rely on my prescription meds  i take an antidepressant  an adhd med  anxiety med  benzo   i want out of how i m feeling. lately it has been harder to distance myself from work and home  because i live with older parents who are at risk for covid  and i am currently working from home.  i want to look forward to things again  but right now things seem really bleak  lots of things are going on in our world and i realise i am not the only one suffering   going through something.  i am grateful for what i have  but i wish i could legitimately enjoy my job  my life.  i feel like a vacation   moving may help for a while but these issues will follow me.   has anyone pulled themselves out of a situation like this   please  tell us your stories  and help those who need to hear how you did it.,2020-08-06 19:58:51
3635,i have to get routine medical treatments that require a few days of rest after each procedure. having a space that is clean  organized  and free from extra stress has been essential to allowing my body to get the rest it needs.  make a list of common  often forgotten about  house hold tasks that you can take care of before procedure day. some of my favorites include    1. change and take out the garbage in every bin. 2. food prep meals for the length of your estimated recovery.  make them not suck  3. change your sheets and have additional bedding cleaned and ready.  4. plan a few activities that you can do that are low energy.  pick a few movies  start a video game  pick out a book. etc  5. make sure you have a plan to stay hydrated if you are immobilized. if it s a big procedure i ll get a big jug of water for next to my bed.  do you guys have any others you would add to the list ,2021-06-08 11:14:47
9427,say what you will  kraft mac n cheese is my favorite guilty pleasure. it wasn t until i started making homemade mac n cheese as an adult that i realized i ve been doing boxed mac wrong this whole time.   if you ve ever made homemade mac n cheese you alway make a cheese rue before adding the pasta. so do just that when making the boxed stuff  after cooking your pasta leave it in the colander on the side. melt your butter  add milk  like 1 4th if you like it cheesy  and use a whisk to mix in powder. whisk it for a good minute over a high flame then shut it down and add the macaroni. boom  the perfect boxed mac n cheese. evenly coated and no weird clumps.,2021-11-13 16:41:01
155207,while i am always stressed and depressed for whatever reason this evening was extra bad. 2 weeks ago started doordash to make extra money. for those who don t know doordash us sort of like uber except you pick up and deliver food instead of people. i mostly do it just on fri and sat during the dinner hours 5 9. i basically never go out of the house except for work and errands. figured dashing would give me something to do to take my mind off my miserable existence and make some extra money. seemed to be working until today. started at about 4 30pm but by 5 i was just not feeling it. stress level was high  alot of negative thoughts  just wanted to go home. so by 6 30 i just logged off and went home making only 25 bucks. laying in bed now not wanting to do anything and stressed and depressed that i was stressed and depressed. can t find joy or escape in anything anymore.,2021-08-06 19:23:05

21072,i thought i was strong. had a bad childhood. childhood is haunting me. divorce laws sucks for no fault state. i don t understand why someone who abuses minors  their spouse  and leech off of them gets to get a way with everything.   now my racist and  entitled  stepdad gets to get away with child abuse and spousal abuse while stealing more than half of everything that my mom  and my real dad  has built. my mom being an immigrant build herself a business and became really successful. until she met this guy it s been hell for everyone. now with domestic abuse and then divorcing... watching my mom s success she built from working and working 7 days a week  only getting 4 6 hours of sleep every day ... to be taken away by some con artist and an abuser. he hid about his felony charges and he hid his real self from my mom with his deceptive mask well until it started to peel off. his real side started to show.   my childhood was not easy since my parents were both working and not present. when they got divorced it took a huge toll on me but it was even a bigger toll when she married this asshole who emotionally and physically abused me  later abusing my whole family and my mom . we can t even use voice recording of him verbally  and sometimes physically  hitting  abusing us. video camera that i begged my mom to install for years  which finally captured him abusing my mom and almost endangered her life and this was done in front of the entire employees watching as well for witnesses  and the court only gave misdemeanor and no jail time since the jail is full. idk if it s because his white and gets off scoff free. he even had people follow and break into our family homes  cars  and stalk us using his friends and we can t prove anything since restraining orders only pertains to him and some of the ppl can t be proved that they are in any relation to him.   this divorce and his extreme methods to indirectly and directly harass torture my family and i have been breaking us apart. i have so much resentment to my mom for raising us in neglect due to work. even though she tried her best to provide us with everything she lack emotional love and her presence. it s still haunting me to this day as an adult. i didn t realize how bad it was since she didn t believe me when i told her that my stepdad hit me and said racist things  when he still had a facade of good persona  during my childhood. i was deeply hurt by it and felt betrayed. i kept holding in my emotions and bottling it up but her divorce has been very rocky. her projection  the way she handled things  her  terrible  communication  and my stepdad constant indirect and direct harassment.   recently my car got broke into and i think it was him. i m frustrated with the court system and how they allow him to lie and constantly get away with things. one of his friends that broke into our home even admitted that his friends with my stepdad and he even lied that he lives at our house. the court didn t even bother asking the victim  had the trial without the victim testimony   seriously wtf   and believed what he said. the guy never ever lived at our house  my family caught him trying to steal stuff  bunch of family belongings were in his car  and he stupidly tried to steal several times...luckily some family members were home when he broke in. the da and the cop said most likely won t go to jail since the town we live in is prestige and don t want to add another statistic  especially a caucasian  to the numbers. had to do a retrial  talk about inefficiency  because victim wasn t present and had to prove that he doesn t in fact live in the house  thief kept insisting that he lives at the house and the court didn t even bother asking for proof the first time around    check for facts   .   the court system and everything is fucked up. i love and hate my mom so much. lately i hate her. her stupidity. her priorities in work over her kids. her relationship management. her relationship to her work compared to her relationship to her kids and their mental well being.  i love that she supported her kid financially but maybe  i am selfish and greedy.... but i want some of her maternal love and attention too  i couldn t get it when i was little and i still can t get any even as an adult. now her whole life is revolving around work and divorce. work to pay for divorce lawyers and civil criminal lawyers for the domestic violence. she s getting older and i can t even call her to actually talk to her. the only rare calls or meet up i get is pertaining to work or divorce. it s less time and time that i have with her and i don t think i have any maternal child connection or relationship with her.  the childhood trauma and hurt is already hurting and i have been holding it in.... and for first time i am actually emotionally explosive lately.   honestly i don t understand why people have kids  life is terrible. humans are terrible. why would you want your kid to suffer through this  and if you think working almost 24 7 while having almost non existent quality time with their kids... what s the point  growing up alone and independent has its ups but it s more down. i want to be more dependent  emotionally  and have support  emotionally . it hurts every time  because she would say  i fed you and raised you   i mean isn t that the point of having a kid  human baby cannot survive on its own without any help the first few years in terms of feeding and many more years again supporting themselves due to lack of experience  knowledge  and also legally some countries doesn t allow you to work unless you are 16 18 minimum .   for the first tine i have been having suicidal thoughts. i wish the laws for assisted suicide would extend to non terminally ill patients  those with underlying conditions .   some people should really rethink if they want to have kids or not. not because society tells them to or everybody is getting married and having kids  following the trend of others in fear of missing out or feeling like a failure if they aren t married or have kids... terrible terrible reasons  . religion or not  people shouldn t be afraid or be limited to choices of abortion. i know few friends or people from personal stories that they told  few turned out to be alright or good while others turn out for the worst growing up into their adulthood. the key here is  chance . it s a chance to give up for adoption and the kid will turn out well. mixed with choice of abortion. i think everyone shouldn t be impeded by social stigma. i rather have a choice more so than a chance. at least i know and have a concrete answer or conclusion on my choice.   ranting and venting done.....    tldr  shitty childhood  can t reconnect with parents  abusive stepparent getting away with shit  my opinion on people having kids and abortion based on choice over chance  people should rethink about having kids and if they do.... spend some quality time  emotional support  with their kids.,2020-04-11 02:45:21
159822,they tell me that they don t talk to me much because their stressed but are also never really open to me about anything. i don t want relationship advice because i know what the advice will be  but at the same time waiting for people is painful.    at this point i feel like they just talk to other people and i m just another backup. but what if i m wrong and they are going through something really tough,2021-08-23 00:07:05

191329,my college sends out these super fake sympathetic emails every time a student dies about how much of a tragedy it is and how that student made such a big impact on their community and how great their personality was etc etc. tbh one of the biggest reasons i m not going to kill myself before graduation at least is so that they don t send one about me. i m sure they ll have a hard time finding anything to write lol.,2021-12-13 13:17:55

138110,i stopped taking the prozax knock off a few months ago because it was causing some side effects and not really helping as much as i hoped.  my doctor had mentioned trying the suppliment rhodiola rosea back before i started the rx stuff. i had it noted to try it.. and i was a chicken to do a 3rd prescription in a row... so i ordered some and i think i m finally feeling.. well  living. it s been about a month and i m painting again. i m talking to people in the shops again. i m leaving the house for whole day adventures. it was raining today and i spend the day doing laundry and cleaning upholstery of all things. shit  i even cleaned the bathrooms  so if you can t get or are nervous to try the prescription stuff look into the rhodiola rosea. it may help you too. love to all who deal with depression  it s no easy task to cope with life when your brain is fighting with you  but you can make today a good day.,2021-06-06 19:41:57

75031,what s the difference between depression and wallowing in negativity. i experience pretty severe depression myself but there seems to be a tendency for some people to just wallow in it. it s like being depressed becomes their identity and they just don t want to let go. everything becomes about how suicidal you are or how little you want to live and yet five years down the road these same people are still alive ander still in the same situation. it scares me a little bit this community is supposed to be a supportive place for the depressed but i see a lot of people constantly posting about suicide and almost romanticizing death.,2020-10-26 15:05:12

158208,my last resort now is not caring about anything. its the only thing that is keeping me alive. as soon as i start to give a shit i am reminded of how so much shit is awful. this not caring thing is the only thing i have now and i do not plan to let go of it ever. i cannot survive caring about something and having it end in misery for the 100 time either.   i do not give a shit that my life will only get worse because i do not care about things  i cannot function as a human being anymore. this is the only way for me to keep going in any capacity.,2021-08-17 06:20:23
181026,i have absolutely no motivation for anything at all. i don t care to spend time on my old interests  i can t seem to find anything to get up out of bed for  and i just sit on my phone or computer   which i know doesn t help. but if you ve been here you might understand that and how the only things you can find solace in are silly internet videos or whatever it may be. i used to love to go outside in nature  but even that hasn t sounded appealing.   i find myself turning to drugs to try to take me to another world  or a different reality. when i come back to myself all i want to do is get high again. i know this world has plenty to offer me but i m not sure how to find it or how to get there from where i m at now.   i want to completely isolate so bad. i ve always had friends. up until this past year and everything changed  so it s hard not to feel lonely  especially seeing other people having fun with all their friends. i know everything isn t what it seems though and that those people are probably struggling too  but at least they aren t struggling alone.   i feel so stagnant in life right now and it s hard to get out of this rut because i don t honestly have any dreams or goals for myself that feel like they re within reach .  i know it s a personal thing  but what might some advice be for someone trying to find meaning in life  what has helped you and what have you found healing comforts in    part of me wants to get better and the other half just wants to see myself run my life into the ground.,2021-11-06 22:27:39
56645,i have been blessed with a relatively good summer. i was jobless last spring but in may i got hired at a summer job for students  even though i graduated last december . but now the season comes to an end and i believe it s why my depression is back  i feel it has come back since at least yesterday . i spent most of the day yesterday trying not to cry. but when i finally arrived home i cried for hours.   the thing is i have no friends where i live and over the summer i got very close to the guys at work. they were the only friends i had. i can t handle the tought of probably  never seeing them again. and i say that because i probably don t exist outside of work for them....    anyway i just dont want to go back to my crippling loneliness. also i may have no job for a while  but that s another problem...,2020-08-15 16:21:30
57205,all i want to do is end it  but i m too weak and chicken to even do that. just being in your 30 s life worse then when you were in your 20 s  why do you keep going  its pointless. everyones thriving right now while i feel like i m drowning.   got to work up the nerve to just figure out a way to end this. i hate sounding so edgy and like a teenager  but it fucking sucks. what else do you do.   adding another post to this depressing subreddit pile  where we all pretend to care.,2020-08-17 18:06:25

125653,i m 15  and my dad killed himself when i was 12 13. for the past 3 or so years  i ve been trying to get out of this depression  but it s sucking me deeper and deeper down. for a few months it was crying all day  all night  missing school because  on top of my usual shyness  i was so unstable. and then for a while in between those first few months and now  it was just this brutal decline in just about everything  i slowly lost all my interests  mental capability  performance in school  and motivation over a span of around 2 years. it feels like recently it s reached a boiling point. i don t enjoy anything anymore and i ve never felt more unmotivated. i ve been trying out different things  lifestyle changes  cognitive behavioural therapy  exercise  but everything always fails and i m struggling to find hope or some light at the end of the tunnel. nothing ever feels like it improves. now i m in year 11   don t know what that is in the us  and where the most pressure is being applied to us  and the expectations are at an all time high  i don t feel a fraction as capable as i should be. everything that i excelled at and was proud of has been taken away from me  and everything that i was mediocre at i know suffer greatly with. i ve been reduced a pathetic loser  who can t even pay attention or remember anything that i try to learn in school. i spend all day worrying and procrastinating because i m so exhausted from being uncomfortable and beaten down at school for six hours a day. it doesn t feel like i have anything to take solace in  nothing to string me along or look forward to  even though i have things i know i should be doing. i have an important test tomorrow i haven t revised for. i really don t know what to do guys  but someone suggested i try and reach out. i know i haven t articulated this well  but i guess that helps to convey how much i m struggling. i hope i m posting this in the right place. i m sorry for rambling.,2021-04-25 19:35:44
61846,i m so weak i hate i m so weak i don t want to live i m so weak i m so weak i m so weak i m so weak i m so annoying i m so everything i hate it i m so everyone hates me no one like s me no one cares no one i m so weak i m so weak,2020-09-04 11:24:19
6288,i m at a loss here.   what do you do about friends who ignore your texts for days  even a week  and say they aren t getting back to you because they are busy.   meanwhile they re quite active on social media. and you know they re texting other friends.   at the same time  you confront them and they say all is fine. she s just busy and stressed.   basically  i m going through hell with my mental health right now and we had recently had a talk about being there for each other to lean on. but every time we talk it s about her and she ll send one or two messages back and forth when the topic turns to me and then she disappears for days.   i actually sent her a text to basically say sorry i misunderstood  and if you re not able to provide the support that s fine  but i do need it. so unless i hear otherwise i ll seek it elsewhere and i won t bring my issues up again. no response until a few days later  sorry so stressed  how are you  all ok   and then  no response again after i respond.   how do i even read this     is she just not the friend she thinks she is  am i being selfish ,2021-09-20 18:03:34
96005,all of my hobbies are rendered to just pass times to keep me busy. i keep spending money on things i don t need because i think it will help and it never does. i can t even say that i m genuinely happy during the scant moments i spend time with friends. everything feels stagnant and neutral if not outright miserable. it might not be a ground breaking realization to come to when in the throes of depression  but i miss those moments of unabashed joy. in any context  i miss being happy. i really do.,2020-12-31 04:25:30
144906,i feel like i ve tried out so many things to try and treat my sickly brain  but i ve only recently realized that healing myself is going to take a long  long time. i ve pushed myself to do so many things that were supposedly going to  cure  me  and it s always taken so much energy and motivation to take these steps towards healing. but then  i m always met with a harsh truth  there is no single solution  and you will probably be dealing with depression for the rest of your life.   and that is so heartbreaking. i feel like i m never going to get better  and i feel like i m always going to have to work on myself. it s like i m cursed to spend my entire life trying to be a decent person  and then once i m decent enough  only then will i be able to step into the world and participate. how many years am i supposed to spend trying to fix myself  it feels like a never ending that i ve been in since i was a kid  and i feel so hopeless sometimes .sigh  ,2021-07-01 07:13:45
3983,in a sense  the goal of meditation can often be seen as acquiring insight. some schools emphasize states of  englightment  more  but still  insight has an undoubtedly large influence in buddhism. vipassana is quite literally centered around it.  but doesn t striving to acquire personal wisdom like this seem a bit.. selfish  for example   optimize for money  you re greedy.  optimize for food  you re a glutton.  optimize for pleasure  you re a hedonist.   ...   amp nbsp   these things all point to being selfish and are generally looked down upon in the buddist tradition. why does optimizing for insight get a pass   you could say  it s how you use it  to justify the seeking of insight. for example  maybe your new profound knowledge will let you reduce human suffering. but you could make the same argument for things like money.  what am i not getting here ,2021-08-30 21:35:10
107388,for the past few months i have been struggling extremely with school so much to the point i feel like i can t catch up and i have lost all motivation and i feel so worthless so it doesn t even matter. i feel like i m about to snap any second and when i talked to my mom all she says is she knows because she had depression that i m just being dramatic and lazy and i m not trying. i m trying so hard day by day and i m losing all will to live anymore. she keeps saying she understands but when i say i don t want to live she just guilts me by saying i have no reason to feel this way because she gives me everything. i know i m only 17 which is young  but i just want someone to be there and tell me it s going to be ok and that they know i m trying. i m so stuck,2021-02-03 09:20:35
10170,many major hospital systems have fixed fees for the above services  of which the provider gets nothing  or the legal minimum  unless they negotiated it into their contract at time of hire. and many new doctors and nurses and technicians don t know enough to ask for it  or even that it can be a not insignificant part of their job . do you think the institution is going to volunteer that information  of course not.,2021-12-06 15:01:19
10314,hi everyone  so i recently became friends with this girl from tiktok. she liked my videos and and i liked hers and we started dming and we have alot of things in common like favorite shows  same culture language religion  we like the same foods and we got along pretty well. we exchanged sc and video called friday night and saturday night for hours because we really clicked so well. today when i woke up i saw that on tiktok her page was following zero people and and zero people followed her   she had like 100 prior to this  also her profile picture blacked out. i checked sc and it showed that i unadded her but i didn t and it said  add friend  but it seems like she unadded me first. i m just really sad because it seems like we could ve had a nice sister like friendship. i m curious as to what i did wrong because she asked me for my socials first and she was more eager than me to be friends. i m worried that maybe her phone got hacked  is that a possibility  has anyone experienced something like this before ,2022-01-02 21:16:05
11,hi everyone  i am a student working with a small team  looking to learn about how people experience stress and what they do for stress management. these conversations help tremendously to learn about the modern age of stress  so that effective stress management methods can be created.  if you are interested  it is a 10 15 minute phone call with 8 general questions. thank you for taking the time to read this and i hope to talk with many of you    here is the link to set up a time  https   calendly.com discoveryinterview 15min ,2021-02-01 08:40:46
4339,this is the third dm i ve received about someone wanting me to give them free feedback on their app store product.  some of these were people pretending to be friendly until i checked out their profile and saw all they post about is their new meditation app.  i am not here to discuss my insights and feelings as a free resource for you to advertise get feedback  etc.  meditation is a deeply personal practice and is specifically a place for me to focus on me  and a tool to help me deal with very personal aspects. when i come to this community  it is openly with no intention but to share and seek understanding from others experience.  it feels like a breach of trust to be dmed about products based on a practice about something so sacred and personal to me. i feel singled out  because we all know if you posted in public you would be called out for trying to monopolize this space for personal gain. it feels no different  in fact to me it feels even worse  when i am dmed under the pretense of conversation only to find out i m a resource to be exploited.   at least the ones upfront don t have such pretense  but it bugs me all the same.  if you want to sell something  want feedback  etc why not post it in public for all to see  are you afraid you will be downvoted  if you re afraid the sentiment  publicly  will be negative then singling people out specifically feels predatory. please stop doing it.,2021-09-20 17:11:21
162346,i was doing okay for a while  but over the course of the summer i ve been slipping. i have bipolar 1  social anxiety  and ocd. i m currently in a depressive episode that i haven t been able to pull myself out of. i guess i just need to get it out there but here are some of the things that have been setting me off i guess     osap got put on hold for both semesters because i literally asked for help  it was only on hold for winter  but when i asked for help they informed me they decided to put a hold on it for fall...school starts in less than a week    i dropped out of varsity sport which i feel was a good decision but i immediately regreted it because of the loss of identity as an athlete      i ve also been sick and haven t been able to perform at my best so i feel like shit whenever i work out and i try to push through which only makes things worse. so i feel like a complete and utter failure.   i m trying to find a new place to live and it s really hectic  i don t know what s happening until the last possible second because i m not in the loop with the other people i m going to be living with  well i am  but i m also not...it s just a lot of broken communication    my np and virtual psych said i need to find a new psychiatrist to see in person...so back to the waiting list i go....      this was because they decided that after 6 months of me waiting for appointments and barely hanging on they weren t going to increase my medication  i understand their reasoning but it shouldn t have taken 6 months for me to be told no...i could ve been on the waitlist before...       they also refused to treat the sleep disorder because they want to treat the depression first  i ve seen a sleep specialist...it was basically a  well this is what my recommendation is  there aren t any other options so the ball is in their court           so i m tired all the time and i fall asleep everywhere   i know it s not related to the medication as this was something before i was even experiencing mental illness symptoms   tomorrow is the anniversary of my friends death  and i haven t spoken to anyone about it and i feel completely alone in it   i haven t worked through my mom s sudden death  so that s great when i m breaking down everyday randomly   my therapist suddenly retired with no warning  after cancelling on and off no showing for appointments over the course of the past 4 months   i don t really have any friends who aren t related to work...      my job also only just opened hiring so i haven t worked since december   my chronic illnesses are out of control and one of the last medications we can try hasn t worked   my grs is probably being delayed because of covid case increases and the potential for dialing back procedures...i m supposed to get it in september sometime...i m so close but of course that fell apart too.  there are probably other issues that i didn t remember. but whatever. i just feel like i want to die all the time. i haven t felt this horrible in months  and being told that i need to go on a waitlist after 6 months of waiting for help was a slap in the face that i didn t need. i feel like i can t talk to anyone about these issues  sometimes my partner as well  because the first thing everyone asks is  how can i help . the problem is that i don t know how they can help. just being there helps  but when the mixed episodes start everyone backs off...or when the really bad depression hits i find myself alone in the er waiting for crisis...nobody wants to stick around or help when it s not the  pretty  version of depression the media presents. i feel like i don t deserve anything. i bought ice cream earlier and i cried because even though i wanted it  i felt like i didn t deserve it and that all i should do is go home and die. i can t even do something simple like that. i m too depressed to even sh at this point because all i do is lay in bed and stare at a wall  which only aggravates the feelings of worthlessness and self hatred. i ve been trying to go to the gym  clean my house  get ready for school...etc but i m always playing catch up with that in addition to the non paid volunteer things i do  because of course to even be successful you need to have 900 fucking other extra curriculars to get a job after graduating... . these things used to bring my joy but now i just can t wait for some of them to be over because then i can sit in my room and pretend to be dead. my anxiety is incredibly high and basic activities like grocery shopping or even picking up prescriptions are nearly impossible. i feel like i hate myself and no matter what i do there is nothing that s going to work. i m at the end of the line  and i m screaming for help but nobody is listening. i ve talked to my np  my other professional support  my previous therapist  my partner...etc there s literally nothing to do other than wait for that psychiatrist referral that won t happen for months  won t be in my city  and might not even get me the medication i need. i ve told them what works and what doesn t work  and psychiatrists just ignore me. medication is the one thing that i know how to fix to help myself. i m literally just asking for an increase to an amount i was originally at for one of my medications...i m beyond done.,2021-08-31 23:42:02
140631,i am highly a highly functioning depressed person. i excel at my job  and am able to stay focused in order to solve various problems in a professional setting  even when it deals with social interaction and being positive when others aren t. i quite enjoy this  although i avoid speaking about work at all times  as if it were a recent tragedy that i wouldn t like to be reminded of  or bring anybody else down with... why   as soon as i begin my commute home  all productive plans for how i was meant to spend my evening go out the window. i dread speaking to family and friends who i love and care about. i dread getting the mail  doing dishes  cleaning the house  paying bills  reading email  or even eating dinner.  at the last possible second  i manage to pull through and produce results that allow me to maintain my lifestyle and relationships  but i always feel just one mistep away from really screwing things up. i ve always branded myself a self absorbed sloth who only cares about satisfying myself in the moment  but i know this is not the case.  i need help  and i don t want to commit to regular therapy or drugs. i know that physical exercise and developing personal discipline could be one way out for me  but after a couple decades  i have not succeeded in establishing any sort of regular routine besides gaming and getting drunk when i have no motivation to do anything else.  anyone around here had any success with a method i have not considered  let me know.  much love. you are truly not alone.,2021-06-15 23:07:05
1042,i m trying to figure out what my higher power is wanting. since i have been taking my anxiety pills my mind really hasn t been raising or it is. i feel like i m here but not here at the same time. we were watching a netflix documentary about a guy from snl and he was talking about childhood trauma. he was saying he needs to tell his story and people at this rehab i m at say they have a story. but honestly thinking about it i don t remember or even know my story. i try to think back to when i was growing up and until now and i can t remember. i know i have childhood trauma but i guess i pushed it so far down that i forgot but not forgot. it s like my mind remembers but i don t remember.,2021-04-02 15:17:40
48974,i have autism and i can keep a relationship past 3 months. i m 21 i m on disability i have dreams but they are stupid. i cut in high school to try to kill myself didnt work. was a stupid plan. my first bad though was 4th grade. 1st attempt was 6th grade. i ve always hated myself. i was dumped on my birthday and 3 months later i m dumped again by a new girl. new girl after new girl after new. and all my friends are gone. i stay in my room 99 percent of the time. i m too germaphobic to go anywhere mostly. all my emotions are running out.,2020-07-17 05:16:29
18233,just writing these down so ill remember how sad and lonely i always have been and there was nobody there for me  or even no one to addresa that so i could just a little bit feel underatood. not one person. this is my past while i have been forced to listen to other  friends  being talked about on how alone they are  or how good things they deserve  or how much they should ve got love. by their grandparents  gradnparents  has this gone that far  well i wish i could revive my granny for many other reasons. honestly im thinking about how i dont want to be around anyone of that sort anymore. i wanna move on about those toxic people but appearently it isnt possible. nothing to do  i ve been looking for jobs i can be busy with but no i m stuck in this misery. did i mention being threatened to being kicked out of the house  it s just alot.,2020-03-31 16:55:48
125948,i know this title makes me sound horrible. but please let me explain. my boyfriend of 3 years has this very similiar pattern every time we fight or anything stressful happens  me needing reassurance  me having a panic attack etc.  he will then have his own panic attack. claim his chest hurts and he cant breathe. he will do this when hes in trouble  after i caught him cheating with me online  or when i try to break up. anytime the attention is supposed to be around me and him reassuring me  suddenly he is ill and needs help and i have to snap out of my crying to help him.   it goes so far that he will  pass out . when we fight he will wander into a room and pass out so i have to come find him and make sure hes okay and bring him to  while seeing his hand move  so i feel like hes just going limp  its become such a pattern that i can predict when it will happen.   yesterday the whole argument started because i was sad he didnt show any energy complimenting my outfits and instead didnt like any of them when i was trying really hard to dress pretty for an event that night. he hugged me while i cried about it but then immediately after started having his own panic attack. i knew the passing out or banging his head would happen soon. i pretended like i didnt see anything and went to living room to wait for him to come out  instead of me running to check on him. 15 minutes later he comes out pissed as hell  saying hes not going tonight and mad i didnt check on him.   we continue arguing and he slams himself shut in the bathroom. now again  i must go try and make sure hes okay. i open the door which wasnt locked and my long sleeve thermal shirt is tied around his neck and connected to the towel holder. he is sitting on the floor passed out. the shirt isnt around his neck tight at all. his face isnt red or purple. i can easily fit 2 fingers into the shirt tied around him. i immediately untie it and scream for his roommate to come help me. the shirt didnt leave any mark on his neck. even his roommate said it wasnt enough to make him pass out. cue the rest of the night caring for him and him hurting my feelings about 4 more times.   when he woke up from the attempt he wouldnt let me baker act him for fear of losing his job  and he immediately was no longer suicidal and worried about moving up in the company he works at. he got mad at me for not hugging him as he came to. i was in shock and his roommate was closer to him. i couldnt have hugged him due to positioning but was also frozen still anyways. later we ate pizza later and he talked with the boys like everything is fine. we talked about aliens and life after death and my boyfriend went on a long rant about wanting to be immortal  and talked about the many frequent panic attacks about death. later we had sex that night and fell asleep cuddling. now hes acting like everything is normal and hes fine to be alone.  i know he clearly suffers from mental illness. he constantly seeks validation but isnt a very good friend or boyfriend. he constantly complains i dont compliment him  when i feel i do a lot. i have to help him be an adult and its exhausting. i had to tell a 24 year old man yesterday that having the same toothbrush for 7 years isnt normal and make him get a new one. i dont know what to do and obviously faking an attempt is still mental illness and needs to be taken seriously but i am just not equipped to handle this. i feel he suffers from narcissism because everything is always about him. just as an example i injured my back a year ago and when i brought up how he hurt my feelings when he yelled at me for my back hurting his response was  oh yeah i remember that. god i hated when you had back problems.  his roommates just look at me like wtf.   overall i feel awful for feeling this way but my gut just tells me it was manipulation and something doesnt seem right. my friend agrees. i havent talked to my boyfriend about it because if im wrong id never forgive myself. but this just isnt sitting right with me.   tl dr  boyfriend has a very consistent pattern of making sure i have to give him attention even when he has hurt me and is in the wrong. last night it escalated to extremes.,2021-04-26 17:45:01

39629,on my good days i try to think about stoic ideas. i haven t read any of the books  just watched the videos on youtube  because i m a lazy sack of shit  but on my good days i think about how hope has been the cause of many of my most crushing disappointments. no one ever looks at hope rationally  statistically. so when i say that i m quite certain i am going to die alone never having know what it s like to be in a relationship  that s not me being pessimistic. that s me looking at the data thus far and making reasonable predictions. everyone who is in a relationship or is romantically successful will argue with me but they don t even realise they have survivor bias. so i let go of my desperate  desperate hope of ever being loved by a woman and i can t say that i m better but at least i m not worse. at least i m not charlie brown and the football anymore everytime a woman happens to glance at me.  hope is gone. i wouldn t say that i miss it but i have noted its absence. perhaps hope for all the other things i need will dry up and fall away too. perhaps it s better to live this way  knowing it s going to be harrowing and brutal and unrelenting unfair loneliness and misery and boredom for no reason till i die.  i ve been thinking for some time that i m going to kill myself when i turn 40. might as well face the next few years honestly  instead of pathetically lying to myself about how it will get better.  i wrote this to vent. please don t feel compelled to reply. i won t be 40 for a few more years,2020-06-15 14:01:09
147670,i m a 19 year old man who s spent most of his life with severe anxiety  mental health issues  and depression. for the last five years i have struggled with bulimia and for the past year i have struggled with alcoholism. i have a girlfriend who lives with me and i love her dearly. i m stuck in my self destructive ways even though my life has gotten better. i m off meds  i m no longer locked away in a psych ward  yet i m still attempting to destroy myself subconsciously. if i try to adopt a healthy lifestyle i freak out and revert to my old ways.   i drank too much again tonight and binged a ton  purging everything. now i m laying in bed typing this  emotionless expression on my face. i can barely feel anything anymore yet i m truly afraid  somehow. i just want to get better. yet  i am struggling to hard.,2021-07-11 05:17:03

19014,i m in so much pain everyday. i ve been through a lot of trauma and have been abused in a number of ways  i was told when i was abused it doesn t happen to boys. no one believes me when i tell them i hate life. i subtly give hints that i m not okay and need help. i reach out but no one takes my hand. i don t want this pain to end i need it to. i don t want to kill myself in a way that ll cause more pain i want to do it the most painless way possible. but i can t find a way too. so i pray to god for him to take me in my sleep. that doesn t work so i try so hard to reach out but no one cares. i realised no one cares if i m depressed and suicidal until i kill myself.,2020-04-03 12:24:45
27222,i ve struggled with suicidal thoughts every single day for over a year. but i can t do it. i won t ever do it. for numerous reasons. the most important being that all that painful energy  i would so called be putting an end to  would just transfer over to people in my life who love me and would never recover from it.   but the second thing is... there is some f      ing bald 7 year old out there right now. in chemo going through absolute agony and in absolute fear. and on top of that two parents have to watch their child suffer like that and they there is absolutely nothing they can do it about it.   thats why i choose to stay. forget my spiritual reasons and other reasons important to me... i am tormented in my head as i m sure a lot of you guys can relate. but because that hypothetical 7 year old and 100s of thousands of others  who have it bad beyond comprehension  can hang in there  then i have no excuse for not doing the same.  i just wish i could give my life up to that 7 year old. not in some means to an end  my end that is . but because my mind is broke. but my body is fine. i sometimes just wish i could give my body to someone out there that really needs it. someone barely hanging on. i would give myself up if it meant them continuing to live out their life.   love you guys.  none of us are alone.,2020-05-03 05:11:37

3833,have you ever struggled to find the series or movie that you want to watch online  buffering driving you in circles    here is a really useful hack   go to google translate. select  your language  and translate it to either russian or chinese  simplified or traditional . type  watch  name of movie series  online free . wait for translation to be provided. copy  paste and search the translated text.  select a website to stream from. enjoy    nb  google chrome allows you to translate whole webpages automatically.   in my experience  there is less buffering and faster load times. the only potential downside is that there may be subtitles  which can be distracting.   really hope that this helps ,2021-06-12 21:16:05
161608,i remember months ago when my boyfriend told me he doesn t think he s ever really been depressed before. hearing him say that completely blew my mind because my life has been the exact opposite for as long as i can remember and if i had the same kind of experience as him  i d be in such a better place right now. i used to think people like that would crumble the moment something really bad happens to them but in all honesty  it seems to be a strength rather than a weakness. his dog who he really loved recently died and he was sad for maybe a week or two but then just bounced right back from it like nothing even happened. can t imagine what that must be like. i m happy for him since i d hate to see him have to suffer through that but also admittedly envious. guess some people are just lucky enough to never have to experience this kind of daily hell that never really goes away.,2021-08-29 12:34:05
5571,is meditating focusing on the present  like trying to step out of your mind   its hard to explain  but i noticed when im meditating  i can either do it where it feels like im in my mind focusing on my breathing  or i can focus on it outside of my mind. does that make sense  its like two different feelings with the same focus. i wish i could describe it better.   is there a right way to focus on my breathing ,2021-12-07 21:40:04
152609,hi    i m early 20s  m  in scotland and i ve been really struggling with my mental health from loneliness and isolation. this is just perhaps a desperate lost call for guidance haha if anyone out here can relate empathise  basically i ve had a really tough few years. i was out of a extremely tough relationship just before covid which i ve found unbelievably difficult and then combined with all the isolation a year on from covid  i ve really been experiencing a huge amount of sadness depression and loneliness consequently  which has also extremely affected and shaken my self esteem quite a bit and i ve lost a lot of confidence and easily get a lot of self doubt about myself. the relationship was quite one way i had to put a lot of love in and i wasn t getting anything back  i feel dumb for hanging on to it for years trying to cling some kind of hope. there have been other stressors as well but this seems to be the worst contributor to my sadness  it s been a really hard time and i ve been trying so hard to get out of it but it can be extremely rough sometimes. i ve been paying for expensive private professional help counselling recently that i self referred myself to try console me through it but i think at the end of the day i really crave some new social contact and try get my confidence back again. i don t really know what my hobbies are either outside of being outdoors vague i know  and coding which is not the most sociable thing ever lol. i ve tried dating apps for weeks and to very little success. i don t know the best way to meet new people these days  in scotland  especially at this age  i appreciate it s a lot huge ask  the amount i ve went through just gets so overwhelming to process and i m just so lost and want guidance  i don t know what to do where to go. i guess it s just so hard to see the wood for the trees  and i don t know what to do and can t see how things will get better. i feel like noone can tell me how to to fix it or that things will improve  which makes me feel more hopeless. i want to get out of this rut i ve been in for so  so long and to feel loved validated again and feel good about myself again  as cheesy as that may sound. sorry for a low post i don t like putting it upon people,2021-07-28 18:17:51

127671,hello everyone  this is going to be a long one. i am not particularly good at expressing my thoughts but here is my life story. i apologize if i jump from one topic to the other. i do not want sympathy or judgement  just advice.  here is my background  i am 24 years old  a male. i come from a very wealthy family  my father is the founder  amp  chairman of a multi million dollar corporation  and i am next in line. he built his empire from nothing. i was born in 1997. my maternal grandfather and mother suffered from severe mental illnesses. i currently suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder and bipolar disorder type 2.  i was born rich. the first time i ate solid food was literally from a silver spoon  i still possess it . however  i never knew i was rich until i got into a levels  grade 12 . i was a fairly active child from what i remember. i have very few photos of my childhood. my mother divorced my father when i was 5 years old. i don t know why  but i barely have any memory of her. she left me with my father. my father was distraught  and since he was constantly busy with his business  he shipped me off to boarding school in grade 3. i remember crying every night missing him. i was in a very strict boarding school where i was allowed to write a letter to my father once a month. he was allowed to call me every week but he couldn t do so all the time due to being busy or me being in some extra curricular activity the school required me to be in. i remember when i used to come back to my dormitory and hear my friend say   hey buddy  your dad called  you just missed him  . i used to be devastated hearing that because i couldn t call him back. whenever i got the chance to talk to my father  i always told him to get me out. i hated my boarding school  i was constantly bullied by people and was awkward. however when i got into grade 6  i managed to make the person who bullied me one of my best friends. after that no one messed with me  but i loathed the school because i wasn t allowed to call my dad and the teachers used beat us in order to bring us discipline. it was not a bad school by any means  it was the typical rich people school. fast forward to grade 6  i went to nasa with my school. it was one of the happiest periods of my life and was the only time in my childhood when i was truly happy. i went to disneyland  had fun with friends  you name it.  then came grade 7  and i was mad at my father for not removing me  from school after grade 6 as he had promised me so. i was always a very bright child but my grades dropped drastically as i just stopped studying altogether because of how angry i was at my father. he eventually removed me from there  but put me in another boarding school close to him. i was devastated as i wanted to be home with him. i did terribly in my studies then my dad finally removed me from there and put me in a day school. now this is where my life went wrong. i hit puberty at grade 8 and went through all sorts of emotions. my father never let me visit my friends places l neither was i allowed to let them have sleepovers at my place. this led me to not having friends  and just made me more lonely. i decided to go on a website called  kidzworld  where i made a lot of online friends. some of my dearest friends  and even one of my girlfriends i met on there. so i used to constantly be on my computer  all day  played games on my ps3 all day and barely left my room. i used to fall asleep during examinations because i was busy chatting all night. it was a refuge for me and i attained great solace from it. i remember sending pictures of my home to my online friends and they called it a  golden palace . i never understood what they meant because i didn t know i was rich. i just assumed every kid used apple products  lived in marble floored homes with fully automated things. i had butlers  maids  you name it. i never made my own bed  i never folded my own clothes  i did nothing. i just existed.  by grade 9 i started facing depression and used to drink alcohol from my fathers stash. i used to show up to school hungover  luckily i was never caught  and once again  i did terribly at grade 9. my father had to pull a lot of strings in order for the school to graduate me to grade 10. my father pulled me out of that school and put me in a school filled with degenerates. i met a friend who introduced me to marijuana. i remember paying  1000 for an ounce of weed. i had no concept of money  and people exploited me for that. i realized that me spending money made me friends  so i used to buy phones  clothes  stuff for girls at my school just to be loved. i then got into a horrible mephedrone addiction  i was told it was cocaine . i remember binging on it for 3 days in a row  no sleep and barely any food. i snorted a line and my nose bled while i suffered a seizure. my father heard me collapse in my bedroom and came running to pick me up. he had no idea i was on drugs  he thought something was wrong with me. he took me to the hospital where i met a psychiatrist and told me i needed help. she was genuinely worried for me but my father didn t believe in psychiatry. he said to her   he is my son. he doesn t need help from the likes of you.  even worse  my doctor suggested me that the next time i use drugs  i use xanax for the comedowns. instead of telling a 10th grade that he should stop this shit  he told me how i can continue drugs without dying. anyway  my dad was pissed when he found out i used drugs so sent me off to london. i did horribly in grade 11  i used cocaine from time to time and got really drunk. however in grade 12 i focused in my studies and got a  in every subject. i even got a certificate for academic excellence. it was the proudest i had ever been. my father was proud and that made me happy. i used to attend business seminars and people were impressed with my ideas  my vision and always were surprised to hear that i was only 16 years old. i applied at various universities and got into the london school of economics. i also learned about the stock market during this time  and i was the best at it. i have never met any trader in my life as good as me.  so then my father decided i join his business as i am next in line. i had to cancel my application and decided to take a gap year. i did wonderfully at his business  and after a year passed i got back to london to study at another university. this is where my life went wrong.  i used to make  120 000 month trading stocks  and all my expenses were already paid for by my father. so all that money was disposable income. i used to attend university just to visit the bar  i never went to any classes and frequently attended university sponsored dance clubs. i met a french girl there. it was a love at first sight kind of thing. she asked me for a free drink  and i remember going up to the counter with her and everyone thought we were couples. that was the way we used to look at each other. anyway  i didn t see her for 2 weeks and was going to attend a party. i was surprised to see her there  fate literally meant for us to meet. we danced together  but i never made a move on her. i was awkward with girls because i didn t know how to be social with them. my brain just shut up. then days passed and we met again at a university sponsored ball. i remember getting drunk with her and we just lay on the grass and she told me   i am in love with you but i have a boyfriend  and i don t know what to do . i told her to be with her boyfriend because i don t like breaking relationships. fast forward again we met in a club weeks later and at this point i was heavily abusing cocaine  xanax  alcohol. i spent a lot of money on people i didn t like  and they exploited the fuck out of me. she was worried for me  so when she saw me full of life again  i had taken xanax earlier then did some coke to get into party mode  she recorded my video. her boyfriend saw it on snapchat and got mad at her because she had captioned  baby is back . i remember her calling me crying and i was consoling her. she told me she wanted to be with me but i refused. she then came over to see me and made me pasta and tried to hook up. i refused again. i don t know why. however once she left  i never heard from her again. i went even deeper into my cocaine addiction  and by this time i blew over  300 000 already on parties  drugs and other people. i was in such a horrible state of mind that i couldn t even trade anymore to make money. i ran out of money  i maxed out all my credit cards and i couldn t afford food. so i ate paper and tabasco sauce for a few days  after which i got an email from my university saying they expelled me. i left my university  my father lost all respect for me and well ever since then i have been living horribly. i have gotten back into trading and i am even better at it now  but i just don t bother trading too much because i just spend it all on cocaine anyway.  i have been depressed all my life  i am going nowhere in life and i am 24 years old now. i have no university degree  my father is worried about me and i don t know how i will take over his business. i have tried psychiatrists  i have tried everything. nothing works. i need help. i have taken medications  been to meetings  tried to make friends but i just am full of anxiety now and just keep going deeper into depression. i have a lot of scars on my wrists from failed suicide attempts  and i have no will to live anymore. i think of killing myself everyday and i am tired of living. typing all this took a lot out in me and i know i ve made a lot of grammatical errors and repeated myself a lot of times but i don t care to proof read.  thank you to all who read this far  and i hope i make it past 25.,2021-05-02 12:19:04
106522,i m so tired. it s 5 pm. i woke up at almost 1 pm. i m ready to take a nap already.  this has been my daily life and it s exhausting. i sleep for a decent amount of hours  but no amount of sleep is enough. some days are tolerable. other days  like today  i feel drained of all energy even though i have done absolutely nothing. i try to remind myself it s not my fault  but it makes me feel incredibly lazy and that it is my fault.  i have a poor diet. i don t get any exercise. i refuse to get off the couch. i m supposed to have control over these things. it s my duty to exercise  do chores  do the things a normal person does that boost their energy and mood. but i don t.  it s hard to work. i work from home. i work on the computer. nothing physical  but it s all mental. it s so hard to focus and be patient. i don t want to deal with people  deal with their anger  deal with their problems  which is the sole purpose of what i do. but no work means no money. no money means stress on my partner. it means i m useless.  he never tells me to work. he never tells me he s worried about money. he never mentions any of it. i m the only one who mentions it. when i mention it  he says we ll figure it out.  but i feel so worthless and guilty. i don t have the energy or mental capacity to work or to help out around the house. i m so privileged that i even have the opportunity to decide that i can t and i know that  which makes me feel even more guilty about it. i have a place to make money during a pandemic and lets me make my own schedule and work on my own time  yet i m too  tired  to do it. it s almost scary to admit that to a large audience of people because i know how ridiculous it is.  i have no idea how to deal with the guilt. i have no idea how to stop feeling worthless. i try to tell myself it s not my fault  but i ve done nothing to fix it. i ve just let it continue day in and day out. if i have done nothing  how is it not my fault  this is what i tell myself.  i m so tired and i feel so guilty about it.  i had to vent somewhere about how i m feeling today.  thanks for taking the time to hear my struggles.,2021-01-31 17:19:38

88903,it was a set that i inherited from my brother. diverse and beautiful they are. i chose the most delicate to hang on my ring of keys. it stood out among the rest  more intricate  more beautiful than the others.   when we were kids we collected skeleton keys. who knows what they open  who knows where they ve been. long grown out their usefulness yet to us they were art. in time i quit caring  i suppose he never did.  when we were young we would have battles. always resulting in us being sent to our separate rooms. through the vents we would talk  we would make amends. 6 years apart  our lives took different shapes. we had common ground  we could meet up. our minds were alike.  towards the end he became bitter  he was embattled. when we got together he would lament. of my father s abuse. he would regret  his choices. he would resent  for i took a different path.  we still had a similar mind  we were kin.  now i have a skeleton key. it hangs from my ignition  it rubs my leg through the day. it is a symbol  it is skinny. like the love lost. he took his life and now he s ash but his memory prevails though it will not last. it will die with me  i m severing this branch of humanity.,2020-12-10 08:34:53
197993,guys  after hearing some of your stories in a time span of 3 months i want to talk about my depression. i was so introverted that none of my friends could really talk to me. i watched every human interaction on television and analysed every character developement just to understand why nobody can really talk to me. i wished to be a normal child who can some fun time with friends  but tbh i couldn t. i couldn t talk with anyone and nobody can understand somebody who studies human behaviour  speaking patterns and conventional relationships. i tried to fit in and then two guys from my school showed me how to speak up and change some things in my life. speaking up was one of the hardest task i could ever imagine. till this date i have problems to open up to anybody about my problems and everything that hurts me. the pain never went away it only manifested into a hard shell which nobody can break. it was like a shield protecting my true self from every emotional trauma. i told fake stories about my life which seemed plausible. every step i took to open up about my emotions i tried to lock up behind a wall of lies. and every person who was important to me and reached a level where he she can break through that wall of pure bullshit... i just ran away from them. i tried to get away from them as quick as possible. after one big incident and the biggest lie i ever told  my emotions crumbled me to piece of nothing. i didn t go to school  didn t eat and then tried to jump of a bridge. after that night i carried an emotional luggage which never went away. every little negative emotion came up from my childhood and mid teens. my friend saved me and every day since then i thank and hate him for that. every person that interacted with me likes me for myself but i know the truth. they ... like the image of me and not my true self. the lies  my past and every connection i had with another person destroys me day by day. i can t love but i feel a strong empathy to others and understand everything they do but i can only feel sadness. when someone other is happy  then i can feel the happiness. but i can t have feelings like that when i am alone or something good happens to me. many post i read in this subreddit talk about having nobody to talk. and i am always asking myself why i can t talk with anybody and still there are people who try to understand   help me. i am feeling like piece of shit every time somebody says something nice about me or try to call me a friend. i just can t talk with anybody. i just work and study... talking with friends about nonsense just to not think about myself and this crippling feeling concerning every move i make. since i was in highschool i tried to hurt my body in any way possible. burning  punching myself or the wall and most of all banging my head against the wall. i always have phases were its pretty strong but every time i think everything gets better and nobody will get emotional trauma because of my actions. every relationship i had get destroyed by my lies ... sometimes i just want to be vanished by existence  so nobody has to suffer... never born or seen by anyone. never hurting someone emotionally again. abusing trust ... its like a constant fight to stay alive and find someone i can truly love ... now 21 and nothing changed. old friends destroyed by my lies and some girls who were shut down by me. no feelings towards anyone besides gratefullness that i at least have somebody who tries. not everyone has this ... i hate the word hope but i still hope that somebody can reach me and be the fucking light in my dark room full of self crippling garbage. or that i realize what self love is... i hope .... sry for the thousand of grammitcally errors i made in my exposition. these are only my uninteresting thoughts ...  thank you for reading i guess,2022-01-09 15:35:11
4583,this may be obvious but people may not know the ramifications of doing so. it will completely void your warranty which could cost significantly if a major part fails. you will will have no leg to stand on at all if a service was missed with the car dealership. it also devalues your vehicle when it comes to selling it  if done before the service warranty ends.,2021-07-05 06:40:22

19025,before anyone says anything  just leaving isnt an option  especially during all this shit going on. so just don t bother.   she s generally an awful person but can sometimes  albeit very rarely  be everything i need. while everything in my life sucks she used to make it worthwhile. but anymore she has made me feel like an unwanted  unattractive  useless annoyance. she requires constant validation and undivided attention and gives me none.  she s also very concerned with the well being of complete strangers but ignores any time i show that i m having bad thoughts. suicide is constantly and i mean constantly on my mind. and before you say anything  no i m not going to seek help  there is none. so don t fucking bother.   it s just a matter of doing it in a way that my kids won t come across my body.,2020-04-03 13:18:31
157728,a very good friend of mine suffers from  several  undiagnosed mental health issues. sadly  his cultures way of dealing with things is to pray. also his parents are very paranoid so i can t call him. he tends to isolate himself because his parents are extremely toxic towards him and don t seem to care the slightest. he visits a private school  but due to health issues can t physically visit it so he doesn t have any friends outside of myself. i want to help him but i don t know how  we don t live close so i can t visit him. he also has suicidal tendencies.,2021-08-15 16:16:56
1239,hi   i m looking for some explanations  go as deep as you like  as to why we often feel relieved and  lighter  just by talking about a challenge even though we don t get resolution from talking about it  for example  if a personal challenge is weighing us down  why just from talking about this with someone do we feel better  it s as if we release energy by talking.  thanks,2021-04-14 21:58:22

6547,i don t feel lonely  but right now i have way less friends than i did like 2 months ago. i m 22 so it s something that comes with this age obviously but just like when i got out of highschool and had less friends  i did so much better in life  and felt much grounded all around. felt like this would be a good discussion.,2021-09-27 19:03:01
28396,i ve known for a while that my entire life is repetitive af. i go to school get home and play video games  do my homework  and normal stuff like eating  the next day i do the exact same thing until it s either a break from school or summer vacation. where i do the exact same thing but without school. i m  friends  with almost my entire grade but i barely talk to anyone except my family and people i m forced to talk to like teachers. i know that this is gonna go on forever and i ll a die a boring life where all people remember as is  that one weird kid who was kind of smart and played a lot of animal crossing . i feel like when i die people will be happy because i didn t accomplish anything of value so me dying just saved oxygen. i honestly get scared every birthday because my twin sister invites a bunch of people but i don t even y all to my friends if they don t contact me first. i stay in bed all day because i don t wanna talk to my siblings. whenever i see someone in the same room as me i leave. i feel like my entire life is just gonna continue like this until i die. and who knows what will happen then. i can t leave this horrible cycle i ve trapped myself in.,2020-05-06 22:59:17
50170,i ve been struggling with depression for so long  amp  through countless methods of treatment  amp  antidepressants i always find myself right where i am right now  contemplating suicide.     so many wonderful things have been ruined because of my mental illness  amp  if it s going to be like this forever  why keep going  would i rather live a long life riddled with depression  aka one that i don t even want to live  or a short one  so i can hold onto the remaining happy memories that i still have. and with my memory deteriorating  even those are going. i m so absolutely sick of this. call me a pessimist  but i don t see the end of the tunnel. in fact  i doubt its very existence.    and don t even tell me that things will get better  they already have. there are amazing people in my life  so many sources of happiness  so much beauty  i think i m falling in love for the first time. yet no matter how good things get  even if it s irrational  i always end up back here. always. it s almost like it s comfort   amp  i ve forgotten how to think any other way.   i don t know what can take me out of this way of thinking  or if that s even possible. i feel so hopeless  everytime i think i take one step forward  i eventually  end up taking one step back.   i don t know what to do. except to stop living.,2020-07-21 23:50:09
79883,as we know  hopefully  relaxation plays a key role in managing anxiety and depression and breaking the worry cycle. what works best for you  i have great results with physical exercise and relaxing music but i m looking for new things to try  something that you can actively engage with  something that will make you feel refreshed. let me know   ,2020-11-13 20:02:03
85145,now  i know no one wants to read any long autobiography so i will explain in brief.  i was diagnosed with adhd at age 5. socially isolated by everyone at school. was called retarded  mentally challenged  creep  ugly ass stupid etc etc throughout my school life. performed extremely bad in school exams. always got into fights in school which made me hated more by others. everyone would say i was a  hopeless case  i would probably never graduate and i will always be need to be looked after.   think of christian weston chandler   depression was crippling.  fast forward to now. i did graduate school with 92  score. got into uni for political science. graduated from that with a 5.57 out of 8 gpa. currently a freshman in law school.  true  i still feel depressed. have scars that run deep. have a hard time standing up for myself because of my traumatic past  lest i be hated. have a hard time trusting people. have anxiety issues. but i am still working hard everyday to improve myself.,2020-11-29 13:31:12
124545,hey all  right now i am so lost and about ready to give up. i do all the things that are supposed to keep depression out and away like a balanced diet  good exercise every day  social interaction  everyday responsibilities like job and school  chores and cleaning up after myself  and hobbies to do in my free time. but for some reason  i m stuck in this empty dark hole that is depression  and it s controlling my life in every single aspect. the next step for me is medication  and i sure hope it works  if not  well i don t even know.,2021-04-21 23:48:20

1720,source  am a father as of yesterday. we were timing everything with a fancy app on my wife s phone. but half the time  we couldn t find it  and when we did  we kept losing time unlocking the phone  getting distracted by messages  scrolling through to find the correct app and then the correct screen within the app  trying to operate it one handed if the other was occupied  etc.  switching to a mechanical chronograph  essentially a watch with a built in stopwatch  was a game changer. a watch is easy. it s always on the wrist. it s made to operate with two fingers. one push of the top pusher to start  push the top again to pause  and the bottom to reset to zero.  it s also only as expensive as you want it to be. a rolex daytona can run you upwards of  20k usd  a junghans max bill chronoscope a tenth of that  while a classy timex waterbury chronograph can be found under  100 usd and a digital casio  though requiring one extra button push to get to the stopwatch screen  is cool retro in both looks and pricing at  20.   it s all about convenience in those first few days. do it  you won t regret it. and when your child grows older  you can gift them a watch with a story behind it.,2021-04-18 04:35:29
2255,don t judge so fast slow down and read.  i am a professional sex worker and i have a unique perspective  take a moment to hear me out.   92  of my clients are attached in some way.  most are attached through marriage.  when i first started i thought  what pigs but they aren t.  at least most aren t.  there s a few pigs  . these guys love their wives and don t want to be visiting me but since kid s  work  who knows what all  their wives have lost interest in sex.  not just sex actually but intimacy all together.  no hand holding  no hugs  no kisses  no cuddling and no sex.    my clients are starved for human touch.  everyone talks about wishing they could have things the way they use to be in the beginning of their relationships and when i ask them what s different it s usually less intimacy.   so if you just have no desire to be intimate with your partner then you should leave them.  if you don t want to leave then you should be having sex with them.  having more sex can do nothing but positive things for your relationship. he s a jerk  well sex won t make him meaner. if he s an asshole leave.    just my thoughts,2021-05-03 09:14:43
177527,i hate myself so much. every little part of me. from the way i socially interact to the way that i think and of course the way that i look. i m so genuinely fucking stupid and i don t understand why. i m only in my early 20s but am so burnt out every day. i deeply obsess over my social interactions hours after it s happened.  why the fuck did you say that  just don t speak to people anymore  is like a daily thing. i make up stories in my head of people hating me and thinking i m weird. i think it s true but whenever i tell anybody they think i m crazy so i just don t tell anybody anymore. i m really forgetful  i think i have adhd but my psychiatrist won t test me for it  and i m messy and i always fuck up on taking my medication and i just don t deserve to be here anymore. i m so stupid. a couple years ago i told my first psychiatrist i didn t want to take medication anymore because i felt i didn t need it and she mocked me  looks like you cured your depression   i deserved it. i deserve everyone putting me down because i m a horrible and stupid person. i can t live like this anymore and i don t know what to do because it s a constant battle with myself and i m losing and nobody cares,2021-10-26 07:02:41

100976,when i first started having symptoms of depression  i was 16. because i live in a violent country with horrible things happening every day and a strict and brutal education system  i slowly started to fall into the dark abyss.  a year later  i wanted to commit to studying hard to get a scholarship to get out of this country  but because of the depression  i could not focus on anything. leaving this place meant so much to me  so i convinced my parents to take me to therapy.  my therapist was excellent  instead of trying to give me motivation and cheer me up  he explained the reason behind why i was feeling this way  how the constant pressures of life had made a destructive automated cycle in my head that would make everything look terrible. at first  his exercises weren t sufficient  so he suggested me to go under some light ssri.  they helped me break the awful cycles in my head and start feeling much better about myself and everything  instead of always seeing the negative  i now tend to acknowledge the horrible truths of our life and focus on the good stuff  no matter how small they are.  my anxiety still needs some improvement  the saddest part is that now that i m full of life and joy  this virus made it challenging to go out and socialize  and our leaders still do stupid stuff that boils my blood  like banning american and british vaccine because they have to use us as living shields.  i hope everyone here will have the same luck that i had and defeat this terrible illness.,2021-01-14 09:17:13

3183,   this gives you an opportunity to share an experience related to their area of concern. also ask   what are challenges that employees new to this position typically struggle with   you can then show how you have overcome those struggles already and are better able to get going sooner.  edit  this post isn t intended to get feedback on your interviewing skills. it is intended to give you an opportunity to prove you are a good match for what they are looking for. i definitely think asking for interviewing feedback is a terrible idea in an interview.  i m an engineer and this question may translate differently to other fields. with job descriptions that can be upwards of two pages long  you may not be able to cover everything in your responses. and a lot of times with engineering managers  they either aren t great at talking to people or they have never interviewed before.  finally  as with any lpt  if you think it isn t useful  downvote it and move on. i just wanted to share something that helped me with people that may be looking for an edge.,2021-05-27 15:11:17
69936,all this is happening cause of my family my brothers don t like me  i m the most hated sibling even tho i m the youngest i m 12. i m very abused by my third big brother he is very very sensitive. i would just mess around with him and just call him a  simp  he would just come over and hit me  hard.now that i almost died with my dad  he acted crazy driving he would go over the speed limit  it s a long story but to shorten it up he thought my mom was talking to someone else. back to my brother  he hits me at least 4 7 times a day i have to go thru this and hits hard  one time i actually thought about killing myselfor cutting myself  but i just had an idea to run away  i never did it to be honest. but my whole life i ve been bullied for 2nd grade to today. now right now when i m writing this my brother hit me with a large bump in my head and a swollen eye for a hit to my face i m still looking for hanging on to life  for now. someday i just wish i wasn t here i might  you know kill myself....,2020-10-06 06:08:18

11268,i work at a healthcare facility that does covid testing.  we ve been seeing more patients recently who have had positive test results with at home covid tests  who then come in for a second test to confirm results.  the at home covid tests are less sensitive than the covid tests at test sites and clinics so  if the less sensitive test is able to detect it  the more sensitive test will  too.  making the trip to a test site or making an appointment at a clinic exposes more people and reduces the number of available appointments for others.  everyone we ve performed the confirmation test on so far has remained positive.  if your at home covid test is positive  stay home for 5 days from the time of the positive test.  see recent cdc guidelines on what to do after that.  if this is the wrong place to post this  feel free to remove this post.,2022-01-02 19:47:57

174504,4 months ago  i took my cat into the er because of a urethral blockage. it cost me  3000 but it was worth it. i took him into my normal vet a week later and they told me to only feed him a prescription diet that s supposed to help with preventing another blockage. i bought the stuff for my cat the first month  but it was  60 dollars for just 24 cans. i opted to go with regular canned food with a few spoonfuls of water in it. 4 months later he s blocked again. i paid  1500 but eventually decided to euthanize him.   he was my first cat when i moved out  and even though i wasn t a cat person  he was the exception. he was the funniest and kindest creature i ve ever been around. i look at the windows that he used to lay and look out of and i cry knowing he s gone forever. he was only 5 years old  and my cheapness cost me another  1500 and my best friend s life. i don t think i can ever forgive myself. i m already in a shitty spot in life and now i m just numb. i can t focus or do anything without feeling angry and crying over my stupid mistake.,2021-10-15 13:58:38
30497,posted a few days ago  and haven t gotten into a better headspace in any way.   i just. as i m sitting here typing this  vomiting out my stream of consciousness  i just can t see a good end for me. like  i don t think i ve been happy for years now  when i really think about it. it s been mostly coasting and faking it to make it. or maybe i have felt happiness  i m genuinely not sure. i know for sure that i keep deluding myself into thinking i can be happy  that there s a chance i can feel more then just empty. but  i think  as fatalistic as it sounds  that i just have to come to terms with the fact that i ll never really be happy. i ll never reach my dreams in life  i ll never see my goals accomplished  it s not even about being upset with mediocrity or simplicity. never had a problem with that. but... i don t know. i can just  never be happy. be it through circumstance  or sabotage  i don t think i ll ever be happy. not now  and not ever again. i ll fake it well  like i have since i was a teenager. but in reality  i ll leave home empty  return empty  and remain empty  repeating the cycle untill my body fails me  since i m too afraid to push the timing on my body s destruction. i ll waste away slowly  day by day  the black emptiness growing with each passing moment. but. i think it s ok. some people just aren t meant to be happy. they re  we re  meant to just serve our time and go. and that s what i ll do too.,2020-05-14 05:36:41

5629,we ve all seen the advertisements for testosterone boosters  usually geared towards older men. however  maintaining optimal levels of testosterone and health is vital for guys of any age  no matter if they re in their twenties or sixties.  it s difficult to project a powerful masculine frame and when the essence of your masculine energy is lower than it can be.   below are simple steps. they are no substitute for consistent healthy eating  workout and sleep habits. the link between mental health and physical health are undeniable at this point. however  these are some minor actions you can take that yield results  60 push ups in the morning  20 out of bed  20 before shower  20 before getting dressed fully. simple way to get in some form of resistance exercise quickly  drinking water regularly throughout the day. there are even containers and bottles that mark daily recommended amounts  taking vitamins  i personally take fish oil  vitamin d  boron  green tea extract  magnesium  zinc  iron  and nac.  lower intake of alcohol and caffeine  sugar as much as possible  don t use phone at least an hour before bed  never masturbate to porn  masturbate every seven days if you aren t having sex. being horny is an energetic  powerful state if channeled properly,2021-07-31 13:46:56
3394,customer service won t take you off the mailing list  if they provided a prepaid return envelope  send it back. oversize weight mail costs extra.  additional tips and notes    always try unsubscribing through traditional means first  like calling the 1 800 number.   refrain from name calling and profanity. the goal is to attract attention  not be an ass.   include the letter they sent you in the envelope. this ensures that if there s an account number or other identifier  they have it.   write your return mailing address on the envelope. if they don t open it  they can still see who you are and stop sending you junk.   laminate or tape the envelope  especially on the edges. this ensures it won t rip open and be undelivered.   prepaid return envelopes are billed to the account of origin when they are used. bulky and or overweight mail cannot be automatically sorted by machines and costs the business more money than a standard letter.   if bulking up the envelope  be reasonable. packing peanuts  pieces of cardboard  and water bottle caps are cool. toenail clippings  salad dressing  and used q tips are not. again  don t be an ass.  an example can be seen  here  https   imgur.com gallery bhzerhu .,2021-06-02 18:35:09

11901,the more we judge others the more resistance we build between us.  even if we disagree  we both have our own vision and rather than force one another to comply and agree with our vision  we can explore the similarities and differences and respect that everyone has something different to teach us.  when you give others the space to be themselves  you give yourself the space to be yourself and eventually what you see in others is something you can inspire and encourage  instead of change and manipulate in order to get what to you want.,2022-01-19 14:49:21

40661,whenever i try to study  my mind always drifts quickly from what i m trying to learn to how much of a failure i am  how stupid i am for not knowing learning anything and how i need to kill myself because i suck at life. this has been a problem for most of my life  since my freshman year of hs   i failed almost all of my classes and eventually dropped out of highschool. it s almost impossible to bring myself to study because of it and whenever i do  i learn nothing  i ve been trying to get this medical lisence for two years now  most people have gotten this specific one in 5 months but it s been 25  and i still am not even close lmao  and i m in a do or die situation. the coronavirus put me in a very serious situation  won t say too much about it other than if i don t get this lisence by august and get my job  i could be going from well off to living on the streets. i have to take my test for it in early august and i m not even close to where i need to be in terms of knowing the material  what do i do  how do i keep my mind from drifting to this dark place when i study. it s been torturing me for almost 10 years and it s getting worse even though i m on antidepressants. how do you all study and keep yourselves going ,2020-06-18 18:21:35
100719,not sure where to start. i have been struggling with anxiety since a young age. i have never seen anyone about it  because i have always assumed it was normal to live this way. in the past few months i have been feeling really  beaten.. simultaneously i know i have so much to be happy about.. solid job  wonderful gf  and a mostly supportive family. the thing is  for about a month  i have struggled to get out of bed in the morning. i went over a week without brushing my teeth or showering. i also haven t been to the gym and that has always been my meditation.  i dont know whats causing me to feel like this  but i feel stuck. my mind uncontrollably races several times throughout the day and thinks about the worst possible scenarios.. work performance  how my friends have left me  my lack of accomplishments  and it leaves me feeling empty and hollow.   maybe this is guilt. im not perfect by any means  but im trying. am i depressed  thanks for reading,2021-01-13 12:54:53

147118,i ve never really been a functional person. as a kid i would just take everything as a game or a joke and be lazy. as i got older it was more of the same until i got depressed. i guess i also feel guilty of some shitty things i ve done. in 7th and 8th grade there was a kid who was annoying af. he would always be getting on everyone s nerves. some of the kids started sort of just keeping distance and telling him to fuck off. on 8th grade a new kid came to school. more of a bully kind of guy and he was pretty good friends with everyone but he started bullying the other kid who was annoying. not just telling him to fuck off but physically too. he would punch him on the arm and on the stomach a lot and make him do his homework. and to me it seemed not like bullying because the annoying kid kept hanging out with him but now i see how he was manipulative to that kid. i never punched him but i also did nothing to stop the other guy because i wanted to fit in i guess.  i also remember that there was a girl who was pretty heavy for her age in the same school. the girls all had problems with her. mostly because she was really problematic and always wanted to get into a fight. i also never actively bullied her but maybe passively by not telling the other girls to stop. idk i feel pretty bad about a lot of things but these are some that i remembered today. although some details maybe wrong because my mind plays games on me sometimes and my memory gets fuzzy and there has been times where i  created  memories out of nowhere.,2021-07-09 01:07:23

8973,as a hiring manager it s shocking how few people bother to make this extra step.   always send your resumes as a pdf. this ensures a few things    a  it appears much more professional  since frankly 90  of the resumes they get will be saved as word processor documents. it s easily viewable on any device and can be previewed in any email app.   b  it helps to hide your errors sending as a word doc will show all the underlined words and suggestions  it just looks bad.   c  most importantly it preserves formatting. there s nothing worse than when you open a file that didn t format properly and it ends up completely messed up with double bullet points  or random spacing or alignment on paragraphs.   a pdf is essentially a screen shot of your file as you are viewing it. so any fonts  formatting  bullets and spacing will be preserved no matter what device the manager uses to open it.,2021-11-01 00:23:16
95961,i wouldn t consider myself to have hardcore depression or anything along those lines but  does life just seem pointless to anybody else  as in i don t want or look forward to working under some random person for 60 years then hopefully having enough money to live for a bit. no jobs interest me and to be perfectly honest for the longest time my game plan was to end myself before thirty. i see no point in continuing past that i don t see life in this day and age to be considered living  it s all work all stress for nothing. i don t have a passion for college rather i m forced into the idea of it by family  i don t want to work but to work is to be able to live so it s not like i can decide that. hobbies come and go  new becomes boring and worn out  people come and go. none of any of this seems worth it. maybe this is the wrong subreddit for this but i thought maybe people here could help me understand why i ve always thought this way.,2020-12-31 02:07:50
124288,as the title says  the feeling of having no one next to me love and care about is becoming unbearable. i have lovely mother and friends i talk to regularly  which just makes me feel even worse and guilty for that  not being enough . i just want a romantic partner so bad.    when i immerse myself in stories of other peoples relationships i can almost forget about it  but whenever i m at work or just doing something else i got that sinking heavy sinking feeling in my chest just becomes worse and worse.   it s not even a sexual thing  i don t really care about that  its just.... i wish i had someone.   i hate feeling this way.,2021-04-21 05:39:16

29431,whenever i m depressed lately it seems my emotions kind of shut off. i ll be more confident  not as insecure  let problems roll off me and not really care so much  no anxiety  pretty much a do anything and not give a f  k attitude    but when the depression goes away it feels like everything comes back ten fold. i ll feel super anxious to the point i get sick and stress myself out  overthink like crazy  become super insecure and disgusted with myself.   i m not on any anxiety depression medicines because that didn t work for me and i was on them for about 10 years. i m open to suggestions on natural ways to help reduce this feeling i have or just any experience anyone else has had so i don t feel like i m the only one going through this.    ,2020-05-10 15:00:43

9467,after college i moved abroad and i never really called my family or friends  but teaching young students has taught me that saying happy birthday to someone on their birthday can help you build a good relationship with your students. this also can help build a better relationship with your friends and family. after seeing the impact on my students i marked the birthdays of my friends and family and tried to call them on their birthdays. it not only brightens their day  but also helps you keep in touch with the people who are important to you.,2021-11-15 01:52:28

316,i ve had an on and off meditation practice for several years now  and learned many things along the way. it s been a positive thing in my life. however  one thing that has always haunted me during my sits is that i furrow my eyebrows almost constantly  to the point of having a headache sometimes. maybe every 1 in 5 sits i can settle in enough that this organically goes away  but most of the time it is a nuisance that stays with me well after i m done meditating. does anyone else deal with this  i m sure it s pretty common. apologies to the mods if this has popped up before.,2021-02-15 22:57:58
72155,whatever happened to treat others how you want to be treated  whatever happened to if you got nothin nice to say don t say it at all. i feel like a lot of us adults forget that and go back to name calling like playground bullies. sometimes i feel like adults only want to worry about themselves and forget that everyone else is a human being going through it too. so i guess to all the adults here  treat others like humans and remember that everyone is going through something.,2020-10-14 09:35:30

9238,long story short  a month ago i removed one mole from my skin that looked suspicious. from that time i was waiting for histopathological results. last friday i was at the meeting when my phone started ringing. someone from an unknown number called me. i ignored that call thinking when the meeting finishes i will call it and see what is it about. after one hour i called and it was a call from the dermatology clinic. the woman at the front desk apologizes and says that on friday their working hours are shorter and the doctor had already gone home. i asked if anyone else could read my results  she told me no one is authorized to do that except my doctor and that i need to wait until next week. things to be worse  monday was a holiday in my country  so tuesday was the next possible working day for me to call. that was the longest three days in my entire life. because of all the previous appointments that the doctor had on tuesday  i found out my results at 14 00 o clock. thank god  everything was ok.   please don t do this to yourself  learn from my mistake.,2021-11-08 07:15:30
11315,i live in an asian country where i tend to stand out. sometimes i find people staring at me. usually  if not always  it s out of curiosity  but sometimes i just don t want to be stared at.  rather than directly asking them  what s the matter  or similar  i act as if they re staring behind through me. i turn to look behind me then back at them. it immediately makes them self conscious and aware that they have been caught staring. i would say 9 times out of 10 they immediately stop. it s a pretty effective and polite way of drawing attention to their staring without having to directly confront them about it.,2022-01-04 04:30:37
3007,let me ask you a question   who do you value the most and why . for me  it d be my friends and my family since they ve always been caring  kind  supportive and above all  honest  with me.  i met some people who didn t see it that way however. they viewed the value of someone by how much they had in their bank account or the piece of paper they got. money can buy a lot of things  but remember this to whoever out there reads this  no million dollars could buy a decent friend or family member  those people are priceless and they re also a wealth of knowledge that you won t find in a book. value the person by their nature  not their yearly earnings   have a good day night everyone  ,2021-06-11 15:56:57
52581,everything is making me so sad right now. i feel so lonely. i guess because i am. i ve been reflecting on have almost no one because i spent so much of my mid 20s distancing myself from everyone close to me and burning bridges. i think i was maybe getting ready to kill myself. or maybe it was just my anxiety. either way  it fucking sucks. i spend my days and nights completely alone. if i m not working i can go days without saying a single word. it s hard to live like this. i m craving intimate attention but there s no one to even really reach out to.   the intrusive thoughts are so real tonight. they keep telling me i have no reason to live. that i m never going to be happy and stable. i m trying so hard to correct these thoughts but it feels hopeless. it s just so overwhelming. my brain just keeps telling me i m not worth anyones time or attention. that i m not interesting enough for the kind of people i really want to connect to. that i would just bore and annoy them.  i wish i had friends or roommates or someone to talk to about it. and not just some stranger... i mean i appreciate the people that are willing to reach out but it s really not enough. i need meaningful relationships. i don t know if i ll ever have that again.  i m so sick of trying. i m sick of waiting.,2020-07-31 04:45:03
4930,i have a great friend who is fabulous and has been for me in many of my emotional hiccups and we have lot of fun together. i happen to have built a bit of a collection of high end designer purses. i have a few and to be honest it s taken careful planning of my finances but little by little have acquired them. he keeps on saying   let me borrow this one  or  the one you wore such time  honestly i don t understand how anyone has the guts to ask for such a favor. i was raised to not ask for anything loaned because it item could be lost  stolen or returned in bad shape and then friendship would suffer. i recently made another purchase and was tagged by the seller so this friend knows it will belong to my collection. his immediate response was  let me borrow it  to which i playfully replied  oh no sorry boo  i know it s material stuff but it has taken sacrifice from me to get them.  i am unsure how to state by boundaries about this topic. ideas ,2021-08-12 09:25:17
3355,lpt every unmarried adult should have a health care power of attorney or appointment of health care agent completed. this will allow a parent sibling or other person to make health decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so. this also allows medical professionals to discuss your situation and care.   i got one for my college age children in case of emergency but now wishing i had one for an older unmarried sibling who is temporarily incapacitated.    i highly recommend having this in place.    an advance directive which dictates the level of care in extreme situations like a coma or life support is also important.,2021-06-01 15:24:05

3285,practiced meditation on 60  days over the last 3 months. i now have a feeling that i am living my life better. i have a better awareness now yet i have to admit that i am lagging behind in focus .  i see these issues with my practice   1. dullness has crept into my lifestyle as well as practice. i am ok with the dullness in life as it has slowed me down a bit hope it is not a major issue . but what is bothering me is dullness in practice. how do i get out of this   2. i practice vipassana   a 10 minutes meditation on breath and 15 minutes of moving awareness across the body. during practice  my focus is neither total nor sharp. i am only able to partially focus on my breath or a body part. the other part is on my thoughts or mental images etc. 3. similarly  while moving awareness  a part of my focus is on visualizing that body part rather than focussing totally on the part.  please provide me pointers to these issues.,2021-07-21 12:04:12

1226,this is a  sequel  post from my previous post  which taught you how to remove latex from aloe vera. i highly reccomend visiting my previous post as both posts combined with provide a complete learning oppurtunity  on how to use aloe vera.    https   www.reddit.com r lifeprotips comments mhi1fj lpt  how  to  properly  remove  latex  from  aloe  vera   https   www.reddit.com r lifeprotips comments mhi1fj lpt how to properly remove latex from aloe vera      in this post  i will be showing what to do after you have removed the latex from aloe vera  and how to extract the gel from aloe vera  which is used in creams and on skin products.       step 1.   cut long leaves in half to make them easier to process. you just want to cut them to lengths that will sit easily on your cutting board.     step 2.   cut off the serrated edges with a sharp knife     step 3.   remove the outer green skin layer with a knife  filleting the skin away from the gel inside. with the knife turned on its side  slide the blade under the skin along the whole length of the leaf  much like filleting a fish  trying to stay close to the skin as possible to separate as much gel from the skin as possible. you can also use a vegetable peeler for this task but make sure there is no green skin left behind in the gel though. skin removed from one side of aloe vera leaf  showing the clear coloured gel inside. if the leaves are a bit too wide  making them difficult to fillet  then split them lengthwise first to make the task much easier.     step 4.   when the skin has been removed from one side  carefully turn the leaf over  and remove skin from the other side  leaving the clear gel. the clear gel strips can also be gently washed under cold running water if you want to remove any remaining latex.     step 5.   cut aloe vera gel strips into cubes for storage or processing. the cubes can be placed into a blender and blended into a gel  or they can be placed on a tray covered with non stick baking paper  put into the freezer and frozen  then put into a tightly sealed freezer bag for storage  where they can be kept for up to six months. if using a blender to liquefy the gel  it will froth up quite a bit  so just let the gel settle and it will return to the correct consistency on its own.     step 6.   store aloe vera gel in a jar with a tight fitting lid in the fridge  where it can be kept for up to a week. just spoon out as much as you need to use at any time  it s always ready to use when kept this way. it s possible to extend the shelf life of home made aloe vera gel by adding various antioxidants such as ascorbic acid  vitamin c  and tocopherol  vitamin e   but finding the exact proportions to use and the expected shelf life from reliable sources is rather difficult. in the book  how can i use herbs in my daily life   by isabell shipard  she suggests adding 1 teaspoon of vitamin c powder to 3 cups of aloe vera gel and blending at low speed.     one large leaf will fill up a decent cup sized sized jar with home made aloe vera gel  and it s a fairly quick and easy process which only takes about 15 minutes   the leftover green aloe vera leaf skins can be put into the compost or buried in the garden to recycle the nutrients  so nothing goes to waste.     hope this helped.,2021-03-31 19:11:54
146735,today i was left home with just my mom and she took the opportunity to confront me and tell me she thinks i might be depressed  and that the rest of my family feels the same way. for some reason i m frustrated though  one would think it would be a relief because it means i can get help  but instead  all i feel is angry. does anyone know why this might be  and how can i actually open up and talk about it because all i did was deny that i have it during the conversation. idk...,2021-07-07 19:08:04
115028,don t know who to rant about this to anymore so it s going on the internet with strangers.  for the past 2 or 3 days it s been really difficult for me most of my closest friends stopped talking to me until yesterday when one of them replied to me after ghosting me all day  then preceeded to say they were tired of me and were giving up on me after the shit i put them through. i don t remember insulting them or saying bad things about them but they said i do and theres no turning away from it they hate me now there s nothing i can do  i wanted to give up a lot before this happened but now there really isn t anything holding me back they probably don t care about me anymore and even if they did they would be too mad to do anything and they threaten to give up on me i don t know i m also told i m horrible with my words i can t help it i don t ever know what to say this sucks i can t sleep either now,2021-03-08 21:39:49

6051,dogs do not know they are about to be in the heat for a long time  if you put a very small splash of milk into their water they with drink all of it  this works great for when you are about to go on a long walk  hike  etc.  still bring water for them while you are out so they can rehydrate.  do not force your dog to drink too much water  give them an appropriate amount for their size.  and only do this if your dog can have milk dairy. and of course if your dog does not like milk dairy this probably won t work.  this possibly applies to other animals  but i have not tried it.,2021-08-11 15:15:32

1507,i ve had the same friends since elementary through high school i am currently a senior. i had to leave home due to some personal issue that affected he people around me. i was down bad. no one checked up on me as some real friends would . i ve always been the type of person to recognize real in people and can notice when people are being fake. i came back home to finally come to the conclusion that my  friends  are not really my friends even after the 10  years we have been friends. i never really liked them in first place but i always kept it real with them whenever we would talk about stuff. to sum it up you don t need friends to have a good time or even waste time   many people don t actually care what you are going through and focus on themselves. with that being said anyone want to be friends ,2021-04-20 11:08:17
186146,my friend always texts back right away when we talk about happy things  and i always give mental support to her. though  whenever i am in a tough place  she gets quiet. my grandma died this year. my dog is probably dying. she is at the vet now. my friend just says  sorry  and that is it. she hugs me in person  but she doesn t give me support with words. i am thinking she may have a lack of empathy  which doesn t change the fact that i love her.   we have been friends since kindergarten and we are out of highschool now. she never tries to support me with words even though she texts me everyday. she just stops when i am in a bad place. i m not mean to her. just sad. i kind of want to stop telling her anything because it is better to have her not know  so i can talk to her. she locks up when she knows i am sad. is it me or her  she just stops texting  and i don t want to bother her with my problems. my mom does this to me too. i don t have anyone to talk about my problems with  and in high school i did a lot of counseling for others. i m worn out. i want to help people  but it emotionally drains me  especially when i receive nothing back. i just need to know   is it me  am i nagging  i have a lot of empathy. is it too much to ask for it back   another problem i have   this friend s mom never paid me the promised  100 for ripping wallpaper down. i went above and beyond  and i also puddied and painted the walls and ceiling. i don t want to ask for it because they may have financial problems and i don t want to be rude. i have told my friend it makes me upset  but not her mom. i don t want her to get mad at me. its been 4 months  and that was a lot of work.   mini problems   they also owe me money for our shared pandora account. like  45 for 5 months. i feel like i am being used. i invited her to sell stuff at an event i paid  150 for  and she offered me nothing  while bringing tons of stuff.  we also created characters together  and she wants me to use a writers name that credits both of us  even though i am the one writing the books. my family takes her on road trips  but i never get asked to go with her.  if i spend the night at her house  i don t eat much cause my friend never makes enough food and i don t want to eat food they want to. my friend always eats a lot at my house. my family refuses money when she offers to help pay  but her family never refuse a  20 from me. they practically rip it from my hands. my friend s mom gets mad at me when i won t drive her   35 000  car to get milk  even though her daughter  my friend  doesn t even have her license. my car costed me  2000  and i worry about wrecking it. i don t want to damage it and waste money. i am driving myself crazy with all these little things. am i being used  or am i just overreacting    anyway  i stopped hanging out with her a month ago for being angry about feeling used and for trying to get my life on track  start an art business and write my book . i still text  and her silence concerning my sick dog drove me to write all this. am i going crazy about the little things  or am i being used ,2021-11-24 15:43:24
52803,i dated the girl i thought would make me happy. i waited until a good person came around. i planned an outing with my section before band camp starts only for it to have to be canceled due to weather. i let myself heal from the breakup and take things slow only to see one thing and break down. i buy a prom dress that makes me feel more beautiful than anything in the whole world and prom is canceled. i eat a lot so i started running to lose weight and i still outgrew my prom dress from stress eating. now my friends wanna have a fake prom and i don t know how to tell them i don t fit in mine anymore. i just feel so empty and so hopeless. nothing is exciting anymore and i used to cry tears and now when i cry it feels like i m crying out my soul and my whole body aches and arches into itself. i don t know if i can do this anymore but at the same time i want to keep going. everything i get just seems to slip right out from under my feet.,2020-08-01 01:25:25

180785,like the title says  i think it s coming again. i ve felt okay the last few months  but i can feel some of the signs that i m getting into  or already am in  a depression dip again. activities don t feel as fun  eating out more  eating itself feels like a chore  overall a bit more irritable. a new job seemed to pick me up at first  but now it feels kinda meh. feels more like it keeps me busy. everyone at work is alot older and they tend to keep to themselves. sitting at cubicles doesn t help either. feels like i mentally have to slow myself down to work there. both my friends got their own stuff to deal with right now too. one is already in a fragile place mentally and the other doesn t really talk about emotions. family is a no go for a variety of reasons. to summarize  immigrant parents and asshole brother. oddly enough  i think my mom picks up on it sometimes through my face. just yesterday  when i wasn t talking and just sitting there for a moment  she asked me why i m sitting there with that look on my face  loose translation . i chalked it up to a joke back about that being the face the lord decided to give me. i like to think i m a fairly funny guy  so i can usually hide things pretty well to get through my days without people inquiring too much. i also feel this subtle desire to cry at night sometimes  but i can t really bring myself to. similar to how it feels like now would be a good time for a dinner  but you don t feel physically hungry at all  so you just don t and keep it moving. any ideas or suggestions on getting through depression dips  i m pretty sure i ll have to wait it out like previous dips  but figured it wouldn t hurt to ask. i ve gone to therapy before  but that doesn t help as it once did.,2021-11-06 01:31:58
4504,any of you do this often  i tried it for the first time and i dont think i cried this much in a long time  probably because im going through a rough patch  but it was a very cathartic experience,2021-10-01 05:47:32

3110,not for me  but for a friend  girl .  short story  my friend and her boyfriend recently broke up from toxicness  but they talked it out and got back again. while their still in a relationship this guy found a new girl who s pretty and kind to him  meanwhile my friend improve herself for him everyday. day went on and they broke up again  this time it s final  so what happened was my friend  girl  couldn t move on completely and still love him even tho they re not together anymore. sadly  her ex turn blind eye and move on to the girl i mentioned earlier. i wanted to help her but i m bad at giving advice  i m only good at listening but never the talk.  btw this is her first time getting into a relationship  so he s the first  and she s still young.    thank you for the advice in advance. apologies for the grammars.,2021-06-15 10:54:17
61007,slept 19 hours yesterday. had stuff to do  but was overwhelmed and just slept. woke up feeling even shittier for not being productive all day. then i just drank because i felt bad. then tried to go back to sleep  but just stayed awake overthinking. i m 27 and nothing brings me happiness. i have no hobbies. videogames that i used to love playing dont interest me anymore. i cant focus enough to read books. art is boring to me now. i dont enjoy being around my family or friends. i dont like being around my husband and daughter. any idea how horrible it makes me feel as a mother to not enjoy being around my kid  all i ever want to do is drink and lay in bed. i dont know what s wrong with me or how to fix it.,2020-09-01 06:42:37

3810,this may seem silly and might at first not really seem like a lpt  but the underlying idea of creating a rediculous mental connection to help jog your memory is actually the heart of this tip.  if you want to remember something... really remember it deeply  this is a great way to do it.  mnemonics  memory palaces  and absurd visualization are extremely helpful tools to look into whether for the mundane  trivial stuff  or for important facts  events  etc.,2021-06-12 11:23:33

72641,every day i go to sleep and wish not to wake up again. i don t recognize myself anymore  no matter how hard i try i can t fit in  not in my family not even with my friends. happiness is just a fairy tail fantasy to me.  i have stopped saying to people that i am hurting  they don t understand they just pretend to understand. i used to think this is just a phase and one day it will be over  but now i know i am born with myself and there is no cure to that.  i don t even have enough energy to type anymore  i don t want a cure i want a way out.  my friends are growing up every day  and i am drowning.  i just hope someone would help me die.,2020-10-16 09:07:16
28648,i ll be as honest as shit right now. and i guess a lot of people will agree with me on this one. social media has ruined me and i cannot change. i see all these insta gram models and i wanna be just like them. i wanna party and look good. this is my goal in life. as a second year law student  this kind of puts me in a very confusing position. i don t know what i plan to do in the futur if i want to be a lawyer bcz my personality differs of that of a lawyer. i dont wanna stay like this  i can achieve many things in life  but i have no goals ahead of me except the shallow ones. so idk if anyone is like me. i guess girls would agree. i don t wanna grow old and have old people like me bcz i took so much time to become financially independent.,2020-05-07 20:03:17
113633,i know i post here a lot and i m so sorry but i truly have no one else to talk to about this. i feel like such a trash human being. i m 25 years old. i m supposed to be able to take care of myself and be a productive adult. i was talking to someone earlier about it and he asked me why i wasn t working. i told him i m in a rough patch in life and i m currently seeing a psychiatrist  taking meds  and i ve been referred to a therapist so i can get my life back on track. he just kept saying that i should just get over it and get back out there. i have horrible anxiety and i ve closed myself off from the rest of the world for a very long time. but i feel so worthless and weak. i m supposed to be able to fight through it. i used to look at the future with bright eyes. i was independent and a hard worker. now i don t know who i am anymore. i know people are looking down on me. i know people feel like i m a lazy piece of shit for being unemployed. i talk myself out of suicide at least a few times a week. i constantly feel like i have a dark cloud hanging over me. i m not doing enough and i honestly don t think i m good enough for life anymore.    i m begging someone to listen to me and to them  every thing i say is just an excuse. i wouldn t wish this on anyone. they truly don t get it. and i m tired of trying to explain.,2021-02-27 02:00:41
533,i see this come up a lot on reddit. men who can t process evidence that a woman is interested in them  because in their own mind  they are too unattractive to want to fuck. stop deciding for the woman. i ve never understood why a woman would want to fuck me  and it s never stopped me from getting laid. i just laugh about it. what do they see in my goofy ass  don t know  don t care. still had sex.,2021-02-22 20:08:41
55891,as an indian guy we are just a joke in the us and the world  i think i m just going to kill myself  i m done with my life. people like kamala can become the first woman president of the us while an indian male is mocked  ridiculed  and spat on by american society and media. was bobby jindal ever taken seriously  nope  he was just laughed off the stage when trump made fun of him. i knew this would happen. all the indians in hollywood are all only girls  the indian guys get to fill stupid roles like cab driver or gas station clerk. i tried for the last 2 years to get a skilled workers visa to move to australia  germany  ireland  norway  sweden  uk  netherlands  only half got accepted and when i got there couldn t find a job that would sponsor a 23yr old fresh graduate like me with little experience so i got dumped right back into america. i even applied for a visa to india but they denied because of coronavirus  so i m trapped here in the us. can t escape  tried everything  and all my worst nightmares are becoming reality. so you know what  i m just going to check out of life tonight  i m done being the ethnicity that i am especially in this country. i am just completely done. i hate that my parents moved here and caused me to be born in the us and therefore a citizen. it is so hard to escape the country you are a citizen of. so yeah  goodbye everyone. i made a note to myself that if stupid biden picked her that i would kill myself that same day  and looks like it s time to walk the walk. because theres no way i can bear to watch this election unfold i just can t do it. i hope some indian guys read this and beg their parents not to move to the us. i really truly do...,2020-08-12 17:19:19

6443,my practice is not at the point where i can handle a 20 minute meditation session  but i m interested in meditating more. i read 20 minutes is a more optimal time  even though something is better than nothing. would two 10 minute sessions  one at morning  one at night   be as efficacious as one 20 minute session    is it about quality  quantity  are three 5 minute sessions as beneficial as one 15 minute session   how can i maximize the benefits i receive  and grow my practice  when i really only feel capable of doing 10 minutes at a time ,2022-01-29 23:14:33
105067,hi everyone   i took antidepressants for years and i was very up mood wise like nothing and nobody could bring me down  but completely unproductive and didnt give a crap about anything and was extremely lazy and tried my best to make sure i could do the least amount possible. i also had this inner restlessness and impatience that could get worse when i m around people  it felt like i wanted to jump out of my skin and just lose it  and containing that then became my main focus when i was out  so it was like i was playing an upbeat character of myself.  now that i m in a super low dose and about to come off i noticed that when i m out and about walking around the world seems super grim  people seem super harsh when i m off it  i was walking around earlier and i noticed some people had this cold hard look in their eye that made me feel i was in a nightmare.  i could sense people presence and how real they are when before i just saw almost characters and if someone spoke harshly i saw they spoke harshly where as now i really feel it. i felt people were real but i didnt feel so sensitive to it all  without antidepressant the world seems scarily real and people intimidating  where as with them it seems more like a softer cushion version  the shortest way to describe it is when you have severe hangover and everything seems like sh t. has anyone experienced this ,2021-01-27 12:01:15

178603,i have attempted previously to write down as well as verbally express how i see things  but nearly every time i try to i catch myself falling into general  fake deep  territory  i don t expect for a second for anything i say to be 100  original  but i don t want to have my message be  but my life is so hard even though i m an objectively well off individual compared to most waaaaa       i m also having a very hard time with structure  everything fits together in my head because that s where everything built up slowly over time  but when i try to write it down  it s hard to explain  i think i m just tired right now  but it s like i ll end up writing down just one piece of the puzzle  and sure  i can write down all of the other puzzle pieces too  but if they aren t placed in the right order and direction then even though all the pieces are there  they aren t going to fit together evenly  and whoever comes across this puzzle isn t going to see whatever picture was meant to be seen  they re just going to see a mess  and i want to prevent that from happening.,2021-10-29 22:01:49

3930,hello all.  i am looking to begin meditation. i have recently  over the last few years  began to take control of my physical  mental and spiritual health. it is all a work in progress.   one thing i notice is that i have always been looking toward the next thing.  if i m at the gym all i m thinking about is what i need to do after the gym. i m never very present. which is my why i want to begin mindfulness and meditation.   my question is  does anyone have tips or tricks to become more present while attempting meditation   should i just allow these circular thoughts to spin around in. y head until it clicks    just looking for insight. reply if it feels right.   thank you.,2021-08-26 21:13:52

123240,fighting depression alone has been pretty tough.. i don t know what it is  but i feel like i just don t fit in this world. i never really fit in with anyone and even if i did i screwed things up real quick. been a loner my whole life. i used to not care  but now it kinda stings sometimes. i wonder if i m actually gonna die alone because depression makes me so boring and unable to attract anyone. i don t know how anyone else does it. i m so tired of trying. i finally put in the effort to call my pyschiatrist again after he didn t call me ... months ago and no one picked up for two days in a row. it feels like i ve tried most shit really. i m just bummed what else can i say,2021-04-18 01:27:01
11556,in the usa if you are over the age of 18 you are either a registered or unregistered organ donor as indicated when getting your license. if you don t get a drivers license because you live in a major city like new york city and don t have a need for one  you would be considered unregistered. most people are under the impression  and rightfully so  that since they said no to organ donation when asked at the dmv  that they definitely won t be an organ donor  this is 100  untrue. in fact allot of organ donors are unregistered. let me explain .  the only time your registry status kicks in is if you are declared brain dead. in order to be declared brain dead  you have to be in and icu  on a vent  and have catastrophic brain injury and declared brain death by a physician. on top of that  there are allot of rules out criteria  over 20  including the fact that you can t have cancer  covid  and you have to be under 75 years old. only a fraction of a percentage of people in the country will ever get to this point  but let s say this is you.  if you said yes to organ donation at the dmv and you have been declared brain dead and you have no rule out criteria  it doesn t matter what your family wants  by law we must move forward with donation. you saying yes at the dmv is considered first person authorization and is legal and binding. your family can give every excuse in the book as to why they don t want you to be a donor and it doesn t matter.   on the contrary  if you said no to organ donation at the dmv and you have been declared brain and you have no rule out criteria guess what  we just ask your legal next of kin if they would like you to be an organ donor. usually we add things like  they could be a hero to 8 people or they could leave a lasting legacy   if they say yes  then it s legal and binding and you have no say in the matter .because you are dead   you could be firmly against donation and if your legal next of kin says yes then you will be a donor. morale of the story  whoever you have entrusted to make medical decisions on your behalf or whoever you legal next of kin is  make sure they know your stance on the subject   how do i know this  i work in the organ donation world and have for years. if you have questions ask    there are allot of misconceptions out there ,2022-01-10 07:28:47

72500,i lost my job not too long ago from just not being able to go respond or concentrate anymore. life hit me with some hard things one after the other and i buckled and broke. death and heartbreak and my health issues hit me like a ton of bricks. i tried to kill myself years ago but ended up just maiming myself horribly. i never got the help that worked for me and have just been traumatized since. the scars and physical pain remind me every day what i did.. adulthood has been a lonely nightmare that honestly gets worse in ways i could have never imagined every day. i know a lot of people have been through this and i feel lucky i even used to make some money  but even then my bills were killing me and now it s all over and soon i ll have nothing... i haven t showered or brushed my teeth in months .. i ve gained weight just eating cheap shit as a quick comfort. i feel disgusting and don t want to be in public or see anyone. i ve turned my life into a painful living hell so anything else  the release will be a mercy. something better. anything. there s fungus on my back and i am literally rotting. i feel so insignificant and like a mistake. every day since my last attempt has felt like a disgusting weird.. unreal joke. i truly wish i had never been born. every day all i focus on is what it will be like to die and every day i m less scared of it. i keep thinking about the quickest ways to end my life and leave as little of myself behind and cause the least amount of pain... for anyone who will be affected. but then i also don t care and selfishly think once it s finally over i won t have to worry about that  and i m the one losing my life anyway. i live in my own filth and in so much pain and i have no more options. i so look forward to death and it still terrifies me  but i know in my heart it will be better than living.,2020-10-15 18:41:12
126830,i m in the darkest place i think i ve ever been you can see from the scars on my face i m not where i m supposed to be all alone why have you forsaken me  all alone you make it hard to believe i m in the darkest place and i don t just mean this jail in my mind there s a darkest space trapped in an even darker cell you got to see it to believe it s true that s why it s so hard to believe in you stay real  but you got to have faith but i wondered where you were when i needed you when that girl was telling lies in the court with her hand on the bible  where was the lightning  the great vengeance  furious anger that samuel. l.j. made sound so frightening she attempted to poison a brother and i mean it in a biblical sense  not a black way she succeeded to destroy that brother it s deep  you can make a fool battle out of laughing she just did it for the money for the cash  eh  i bet she s rolling in it now she s famous you must think that s fair considering i got to deal with man who want to feel a new anus so you save up a months worth of fags and trade them for a shank along with your trainers and you take a man s life with your make shift knife  cause this isn t you  messed up your brain is. i m in the darkest place i think i ve ever been you can see from the scars on my face i m not where i m supposed to be all alone why have you forsaken me  all alone you make it hard to believe are you real or a myth  is there a heaven or just an abyss  sometimes i wonder if you even exist  cause if you do then you re taking the piss i don t deserve this why are you torturing me god  we both know something ain t right here it s been two whole months since i killed that man and i m still having nightmares it was just self defence but try telling that to my conscience my head s in a real bad way but even when i tell you  you ignore me like its nonsense i was being attacked on a daily basis i had to do something and it weren t like you were going to intervene at any point  cause you never do nothing just i thought you d sent me an angel when the second man tried put the first cut in and got stabbed instead  but now i know that was just in my head  not the hole that i m stuck in  cause if he really was an angel you sent he wouldn t be trapped in this jail with me spread out his wings and fly get out of this hell hole quickly that s how i know you re a fake that s how i know you re a lie that s how i know you re a made up fictional character that lives in the sky yeah it s all just a con it s all just a scam god ain t real it s just a sham. i m in the darkest place you can see from the scars on my face ooh yeah i m in the darkest place i think i ve ever been you can see from the scars on my face i m not where i m supposed to be all alone why have you forsaken me  all alone you make it hard to believe i m in the darkest place i think i ve ever been you can see from the scars on my face i m not where i m supposed to be all alone why have you forsaken me  all alone,2021-04-29 15:53:18
41151,but i ve been so depressed lately. i wake thinking about killing myself. i keep telling myself it s not the answer and continue with affirmations to remind myself of why it s not the option. but this isn t effective enough. i ve tried talking to my family  i ve stopped smoking marijuana  honestly only just recently in the past few days   i ve even quit my job because of the mounting stress it was causing.  i can t bring myself to do anything that i love to do. i barely even want to post this. i wish crying was enough  but i can barely even do that  not because it isn t a macho thing for a man to do  but because of my depression. i barely feel like dealing with it is the answer  but i definitely don t want to wallow either. i don t have insurance or money to see a therapist  and medication doesn t help  all it does is make these feelings worse.  i don t know what i should do  and my life feels like it s circling the drain...,2020-06-20 07:50:16

3266,life is actually quite regular and consistent. nature moves in cycles and by aligning with the cycles of life  you can navigate it easier.    of course  humans try to mold and control these cycles  but to control natural cycles is to live in resistance. it s the reason so many humans are unhappy. you intuitively know the natural cycle of life yet are being forced into something else.,2021-05-29 15:42:47

23911,i feel so numb. it s like my life has become an endless and devastating loop  nothing means anything anymore. i m only living for other people  i only show my  emotions  for other people  so people like my mom don t ask questions. i m so good at hiding at how i feel that nobody really knows and the people i have opened up to were shocked. i told my mom i want help  she said i seem fine  and i don t blame her  i seem really okay on the outside. she took me to get my physical at the doctor and they asked about my mental health  my mom told her i had a bit of anxiety hit i seem to be handling it well. i can t hide my anxiety from her so ofc she knows about it  and when my doctor asked me about what i was doing to help i told her some bullshit answer  drawing  writing  listening to music  and now my mom is convinced i m perfectly happy. my brother has been trying to get my mom to take me to therapy because i ve opened up to him and he knows somewhat how i feel  but to be honest i don t know if i want therapy because if it doesn t work i think i will lose hope and end up killing myself. because at this point therapy and medication is my last hope. i have tried everything  and at this point my life feels so meaningless. i don t see the point in doing anything anymore  we will all one day die  so why waste time. like i just feel so alone  and numb  i only have 2 emotions  numbness and sadness  every other  emotion  i show is for the benefit of other people  so they don t worry.   thank you for coming to my ted talk  lt 3,2020-04-21 23:58:40
3650,did you notice that wherever you think about a product or service  you start seeing lots of ads promoting that product   this happens because of the personalized marketing. and for the very reason  you start buying things that you never needed  still you feel like you needed that.  so wait for a week  without adding the product to your cart   and if you remember buying it  then go for it. otherwise you ll end up saving loads of money.,2021-06-08 16:31:12

61082,i have my job but i still live at home  paying my portion . i was about to rent an apartment with 3 other friends including my brother but she said it s a smarter idea if i get a mortgage for a house  btw i dropped out of college one semester away from graduating . i have a full time and am about to be here for a year. i only told her just so she could have a heads up but then i settled herself i to our situation and somehow convinced me that it would be dumb throwing money at an apartment  even after i did my research. any time i try to explain  we argue a lot. she gets really angry and if i say no  it s like she doesn t want to hear it and then goes on this rant of how we can do whatever we want but implying when we fail that she won t help us  i m like ok but why do you have to add that last part...   in order to stay sane i decided to go with her idea. to buy a house with me and my brother while i still don t have a degree. i ve read some real estate books and watched personal finance youtubers but they all have sometimes conflicting views and at this point i m overwhelmed. i m afraid of making that giant leap and possibly get into debt all because i followed my mom. or i don t  and lose the opportunity with my brother. any rebuttals i bring up it s like she s personally being attacked and people around only see a kid talking back but they never understand myyyy side. hell one time she overreacted over ice cubes on the floor that didn t even cause a mess but turned into this huge argument for nothing. idk. i m overwhelmed and can t decide. my brother wants to do it  i do but...but i don t want to go down the wrong path. i know i know do my own thing  don t let others choose for you but it s not that simple.,2020-09-01 14:13:23
1041,intuitively i know meditation is a beneficial practice.  i practiced for a brief period years ago  then stopped.  i have begun my practice again and had been consistent for 3.5 months up until a couple weeks ago.  as i stated in the title  i have always felt an obligation when i do it  never a desire  often times even a dread whenever i know the time to meditate is approaching.    i know mindfulness is a key to living a more harmonic  natural and peaceful life.  i just have no desire to sit down at any period of the day and meditate.  i use the 10 percent app when i meditate and have found the concept of mental noting  ex  when you realize that you are thinking  say the mental note in your head   thinking   from the primary teacher i am following  joseph goldstein  to be beneficial.  but i do not like the repetitive nature of the practice using the app.  just looking for some guidance or advice.,2021-04-02 15:09:24
149307,for a long time my family had been living with my grandparents in which my grandpa got sick west nile virus and for 3 years he was assisted by nurses  my mother and grandma until he passed away in 2018. after a while  my older uncle had divorced split with his wife and moved in with us in i believe late 2019. now it hasn t been the best as he had conflict with my sister but he wasn t in the best shape either. in recent months  he had made a  big argument with me as i didn t ask him if he wanted some drinks when i was with the entire family when i knew he wouldn t want one. when i returned with the drinks he soared raging and talked lots of crap but i just walked out sad and went on a walk. i haven t talked with him too much but just recently i had got in a argument with my younger uncle who was being stubborn and always felt as if he was right. currently my grandma and mother have been siding more with the uncles but also feel the need to just treat them extra better. now just recently we have been thinking about moving out but i ve just kept in so much thoughts inside me and i ve just been very disappointed and sad with life. sometimes i ve thinking oh why can t my life just end. while i don t believe i would ever harm myself  i m constantly having these thoughts wishing life would just end so i wouldn t deal with none of this anymore. i don t know what to do with life and i m not very happy with how much pain i ve kept inside. i just don t know what to do anymore.,2021-07-17 01:43:23

404,my power was out for a few days due to the  southern freeze   and the only lights we had were scented candles from a sizeable collection of unused scented candles that built up over years of buying them. because i already owned so many scented candles  i never before thought i would need to buy regular candles  boy was i wrong.  none of the scents matched each other  so my apartment was filled with a gross odorous cacophony that made me nauseous  on top of already being cold and hungry. i know scented candles smell great  but you only ever need one or two at a time. make sure you have a supply of  unscented  candles for emergencies like this.  i never want to smell a scented candle again.,2021-02-18 22:36:33

155783,one day a little child was born with a painful birth defect that caused them to constantly bleed from the eyes. this permanent stream of ruddy tears weakened the child s health and required special medical treatment every week or they might die.  as the child grew up  they asked their parents why their eyes bled  and why were they always suffering  and their parents never had an answer.  the child s parents would sometimes become annoyed when they heard the child weeping in agony as they knew it meant one of them would have to clean up the mess again.   the parents would dread taking their child with them to friends  houses or out to dinner  because they were sure that at some point their annoying child would start howling in pain and crying blood at the most inopportune moments.   one day when the child got old enough  their father pulled them aside for a special talk.  father  child  you are now too old to be given constant accommodation and special care for your bleeding and pain. i am now going to teach you how to be an adult.  the child looked on in horror as their father seemingly pulled away his face  revealing underneath a face pretty much like the father s apparent mask  but bruised and scarred.  child  why do you wear a mask father   father  all adults wear masks  it is the polite thing to do. my true face is bruised and beaten because my father would beat me and my siblings as punishment for every small thing. but it is rude to keep reminding people in the world that there are monsters pretending to be people  so i wear a mask just as my father did  and just as you will  child.  child  father  i do not want to wear a mask  it hurts to touch anything to my face.  father  it hurts me to wear a mask as well child  but you must if you are to live on your own and become your own person. what other person would want to work with or live with someone who was constantly crying and bleeding  you need other people to survive  and you need to look and act like them if you want them to deal with you like a person.   child  will the mask stop my bleeding   father  no  in fact it will likely make it worse  and you will likely get infections and complications early on. most of us do. but you will deal with it like every other adult that has come before you.   the father handed the child a plain porcelain mask.   child  this mask does not look like me.  father  none of them do at the start. you have to practice wearing it. practice talking through it. practice taking it off at night and putting it on on in the morning. when you have done this enough  no other adult will even know that you are suffering. isn t that worth it   the child took the mask in silence and left his father to practice wearing the mask.   the child wasn t very good at it. the blood from their eyes made the mask slip  and still dripped out the bottom staining their clothes and the floor. and wherever the mask touched felt like raw slices of pain.  when the child went to school it seemed none of his other classmates wore masks. in fact  when they saw the child s plain porcelain mask with the blood dripping from the bottom  they mocked the child and harassed them on the way home from school.   this tormented the child  confused at his father s claim that everyone wore masks  they went to speak to their mother.   child  mother  i do not like wearing my mask. it hurts  and doesn t hide my bleeding from anyone  none of my classmates had masks  why do i have to wear this   mother  oh my beloved child  those students  were  wearing masks  and have been practicing wearing them since before kindergarten. you did not realize it because you didn t know what to look for. now that you do  you will soon see the cracks and peeling paint that reveals your classmate s masks.   child  if all of them wear them like me  then why were they cruel to me because of my mask   mother  because you are not good enough yet at using your mask to hide your pain. do you think  they  enjoy being constantly reminded of their own masks by looking at yours  you must learn how to be more skillful at using your mask.   child  what about my sisters and brothers  do they wear masks   mother  yes little one  of course   child  why   mother  your sister has a blemish above her lip  so she hides that so people won t find her disgusting. your brother has two different colored eyes  so he hides those so people won t think of him as a freak.   child  are their faces painful like mine  do they constantly bleed like i do   mother  no  everyone s face is different. but you must not complain that your face is more painful or difficult to manage  because   we are not allowed to talk about our faces with anyone  ever.   we all have to pretend that we are   not   wearing masks so that everyone else can be comfortable.   child  this doesn t seem fair. i have never seen my brother or sister visiting the hospital every week for transfusions. i never see them curled up and crying because they are wracked with pain.  mother then took off her own mask revealing a face exactly the same as her mask except her eyes were dead and cold.  mother  how dare you compare yourself to your siblings  they have suffered a lot of mockery before they learned to wear their mask correctly. it s not their fault you  are taking so long  to figure out how to wear yours  you have always been a burden with the constant cleaning and special treatment  the trips to the emergency room and incessant crying. sometimes i wish you had never been born.  mother then put her mask back on and her bright smile lit up as she tutted and touched her child s face.  mother  now be a good child and go practice wearing your mask  and remember  don t ever talk to anyone else about the fact that masks exist . and i d prefer you stop talking to your father and i about it as well.   over the years the child got very good at wearing their mask. they figured out tricks like how to wad up gauze under the mask to hold the bleeding  and figuring out clever ways to swap the gauze during the day when no one was looking.   they built up calluses on their painful bleeding face  that while not completely deadening the pain  allowed the child to wear the mask for most of the day without crying and bleeding too much.   when they wore their mask correctly for a very long time  people stopped mocking and harassing them. in time the child grew to an adult and got a job and met someone who liked spending time with them.   but never did their eyes stop bleeding. never did their face stop hurting. and they congratulated themselves as they changed the gauze one day hidden in a grocery store bathroom  that they had finally learn to wear the mask well enough to be treated as a human.   as they wept tears of blood into the toilet.,2021-08-08 19:10:35

2697,i ve been thinking about weed and meditation ever since i ve begun practicing it. meditation  not smoking.     on one hand it helped me get into really deep meditative states  on the other these were sometimes unpleasant and or profound  weird.  i wondered how does weed work  why does it do that... and i want to share with you what i came up with.  i believe weed puts us in a state of higher awareness. that s why it s so easy to dwell on some specific thought  or figure something out. another thing that supports this theory is the dryness in mouth. i thought it s because of how it s injested  but same thing happens with drops  pills  edibles. weed makes you more aware of your body  and most of us are dehydrated without even knowing it. you can test it  i no longer smoke  by making sure you re very well hydrated and then smoking a joint. i guarantee the dryness won t be there. same goes for stretching... oh man i ve done a lot of stretching in my life  but stretching while high is something else.  i m not saying i m 100  right  it may be just a a part of the truth  however  it resonates well with me.  very curious to hear your thoughts ,2021-06-21 01:46:22
5815,just thinking in terms of real world examples of energy conversion where energy storages producing heat light kinetic energy require some sort of introduction of power to make that conversion.  it s almost like shutting off all the senses through meditation helps one become enlightened  but i prefer to think it s more along the lines that it raises our vibrational energy  which in turn creates light energy at the brain where the most electrical signals are occurring at any time,2021-12-26 01:48:41
10498,our talks are getting more and more redundant. i go  and we always talk about the same things. she asks me to do something  i say yes  i come home  and i never do it.  i go back and repeat the same thing. i just can t talk to her anymore  it s filled with uncomfortable silence more than actual conversation.   i can t tell her anything.   i feel like if i told her what i think  what is actually going on  she d tell my parents. i want to let it out so bad  i want to scream and punch a fucking wall.   it s building up and i m so frustrated. i can t go to a school counselor because they would most definitely call home.  my head actually feels like it s going to explode from the pressure. i m just so scared of what will happen when it eventually does.,2020-03-03 23:07:11
171934,i have everything. i have a family who loves me  a roof over my head  luxuries that millions of people don t have...yet here i am being depressed and finding little joy in life.   when something goes wrong  i feel everything break down around me. something is wrong with me. i ve been feeling pain for as long as i can remember. why do i have to be so fucking sad all the time. why can t i just be happy   i feel useless and ungrateful for not enjoying my life.,2021-10-06 00:31:55
6336,hi  im takling with a girl  it is pretty good we are talking for a week now  sometimes she textes first sometimes me. the problem is and also think that makes me sometimes mad is her late answers and slow replying. she reply to my message and then she goes offline on instagram  where we text  and also on snapchat for 3 hours then go online text me and then again go offline for minutes even 2 hours. so sometines it takes her minutes or hours to answer. dont tell me that i should live a life  im 16  im lifting  learning about trading and investments  playing football and also im a lot of times with my friends  in gym or outside. she text me even when she is with friends. but like im saying  she can go silent for hours then reply to my message and again go silent for 2 hours. and she is offline on all social media she has. so im asking... is she busy  or she is just playing hard to get ,2021-09-22 10:47:32
65,i can t believe this post has gotten so much attention. thank you all so much  this is surreal and also gratifying. it makes me happy to know that this tip is getting out there  along with several others that i ve seen mentioned in the comments.   a lot of you have brought up homeless people  and i agree that their lives matter too. the main reasons i didn t mention them in the post title are because this is about animals  and also about blankets that most people would consider unappealing or even unusable. if your unwanted blanket is still in decent condition  then by all means donate it to a homeless person or shelter.  some of you have mentioned the fact that many animal shelters have an overload of donations or for a number of other reasons aren t accepting them. so yes  it s always a good idea to call ahead.   veterinary clinics are a good place to donate to as well  and as mentioned  towels and sheets are also a good thing to keep in mind.  one more thing i d like to say  i am so humbled by your generosity with awards for this post  but i implore you to give your money away elsewhere. please donate it to homeless or animal shelters or to other reputable charities. they need it more than i do.,2021-02-04 00:10:55

33082,i had another anger outburst. i said things to my father i didn t mean. this isn t my first  second or third time. i wish i can just go back in time and stop myself from saying the shit i said. i like  i tried to tell him i need help for this stuff but the conversation drifted into the topic of me smoking weed hispanic parent hates weed so . idk. i need help but i m afraid of seeking. my mom only seems to understand me but she s states away. i honestly feel like a disappointment to my father and such a asshole. i really wonder if sometimes he d be better without me. at this point idk  i just feel so bad for everything i done. it s hard to explain the feeling of  i didn t mean it  when the damage is already done. i just feel like idk...i really hate myself sometimes. i try looking up ways to control myself but well...didn t go so well. i ve gone as far as hitting walls  physical with family members  slamming doors and yelling. today wasn t a family member but my dads female roommate. i feel like such a waste of space  i don t want to get in the specifics but essentially i texted my dad some very nasty things and points of views only a raging me would say about him and his female roommate. i ended up coming home slamming the door and knocking at her door. i told her  don t ever ask me for favor again  i sold weed to her in the past. the reason i was mad was she told my dad some things that weren t as serious but my dad being my dad took it 100  serious. i was infuriated because she s done some questionable things where i kept secret because well that s how i like things to work  anyways she ask me to calm down and talk. i told her no because my dads on my ass. well i m here now in my bed. everything s resolved but i feel shitty. he s leaving tomorrow morning to help out people in medic tents during the pandemic  he s in the army  and he s leaving for a month. so it s just me and this girl. i m currently applying places to work because honestly  i don t think me and hers relationship is gonna work. well i kinda vented but the point of this post is that i feel terrible for everything i caused today out of anger. i was speeding home with intentions of slashing her tires. and all this guilt  my dads disappointment. i just feel like a terrible son and idk how to express my feelings,2020-05-23 02:26:34
35869,welp one of my few distractions from wanting to kill my self was getting lost into a video game and now my inky console died just straight up quit on me so now i don t have that outlet. now i have to just sit around with suicidal thoughts all day,2020-06-01 22:36:10
262,try being positive instead of negative. this took me a long time to do  but start now. the easiest way for me was i made a mental note that whenever something negative happened  i would try to find the good. it s really hard to do at first  but once you do it over and over it gets easier.  positivity really can change your life. default to good.,2021-02-14 10:04:59
14282,i don t know how to start this. i feel lonely. not because of the social distancing... in fact maybe it even would be okay if my so was here with me. but here i am  alone without a chance to talk to him or see him even through a phone screen. he was my support system and he helped me go through the roughest times of depression. and now i m slipping back.   i can feel like my soul is escaping the body  it is foreign to me  again. i lost all the colours and happiness i had  i can t sense or taste anything. there is only pain and deep sadness. i m lost and i don t know what to do. i can t even express my feelings to anyone. parents or the only friend are not the people i would open up to and so is not available and i can t put the stress on him.  i hate myself for being a burden to everyone and eventually my so will probably leave me. even i can t stand myself. he would be disappointed if he d knew that i m depressed again. i don t want him to worry about me.  i have a therapist but... it s too much to handle... i used to take medicine for depression but i felt even worse.   i guess i just needed to write it all out...,2020-03-16 19:42:52
176281,i don t know where exactly things went wrong for me. i had never been comfortable with myself and i d always hated the idea of being alone with myself. i don t know why i m so unhappy with the way i am because i don t even have an excuse to be  there are people with much worse circumstances. i used work and friends to keep myself distracted from being with myself but it got to the point that i just couldn t keep up with it. i stopped reaching out to people because i just couldn t force myself to make the effort anymore and i ve lost almost everyone  i also just don t have it in me to flog myself to work anymore. i had have a relationship that is suffering and about to end because i hate myself to the point i push my partner away. i feel like i don t deserve a partner with how pathetic i am. i see everyone else being happy with their lot and i don t know why i can t find any peace or contentment with mine. i burned out from working to keep this shallow life of mine going which was keeping me from facing all this hate within myself for me. i ve fallen behind all my other batchmates because i can t find it in me to keep anymore and that makes me even more miserable. i can t do anything  people say i need to learn to love myself but everytime i look at myself i see this miserable  weak  pathetic semi man child that doesn t deserve love. i shouldn t be so unable to control my negativity  i shouldn t be so weak that i concoct unhappiness out of nothing and use it to paralyze myself. i don t have any excuse to be feeling like crap and that makes me feel even more like crap because i know that there s no justification for it. i feel like i m just sitting on my ass doing nothing now and everything else in my life is moving on while i m slipping away because now i m just too tired to keep up my act and keep doing whatever i can to somehow not think about how much i hate myself. i don t think i have a right to feel this way because it s all self inflicted and it s stupid because i should ve been able to be more in control  but no matter matter what i do i can t help but feel this way.,2021-10-22 00:16:58

5403,i ve been humilated  laughed at and bullied.  what could i possibly do with that   is one example of what has been said to me. doesn t help i m ugly either.  strange because i know that i won t make it to 21. i ve planned everything through carefully.   i just can t cope with the constant reminder on social media and everyday life. all of the bullying and mental torment has made me become a horrible person.   i go on tiktok for a laugh and see loads of posts about small dicks and mocking them. i go on facebook and see the same. in groups i always hear about girls talking about how he had a  small dick .   i got sent a screenshot of a group chat talking about my small dick and with laughing emojies.  i ll never develop a relationship now  let alone friendships.    i ve come to the conclusion  i m not a man  and never will be enough.   i m going to try and hang myself.,2020-02-17 20:27:38
1768,i can t tell you how many times my modern warfare has had a patch with my console telling me there s no storage left. a quick fix is to simply uninstall and reinstall the game. getting rid of said game will allow you to reinstall it with the current patch with no issue.  most of the time the console will tell you to delete at least 20gb for a 5gb patch. don t fall for this.,2021-04-19 11:48:29
2526,most of the time i meditate by trying to follow my breath. i notice thoughts come up and try to ignore them and come back to the breath. typically while i m doing this it feels like a normal activity  like there s a goal in mind. the goal  become more calm  peaceful  etc.   at one point i had a short moment of  no thought  and felt absolute bliss. watching my breath feels like a way to achieve that bliss again.   however  i meditated differently today. this time i just sat there and tried to allow everything to just be. i noticed things and that s it. like  everything  not only the breath. i went from sound  to body scanning  to breath  to smell  back to sound  etc. and it felt great during and afterwards whereas breathing feels frustrating during and okay after.   if i m going by pure feeling  then i d just go with the second way i meditated  but i want to know what you guys think. am i doing the breathing meditation wrong  it feels that way. is the other way i meditated wrong  idk  but please enlighten me   ,2021-06-11 19:40:39
200602,i have nothing to talk about  my mind is empty. they say if you don t use it  you lose it. i haven t had a genuine conversation with someone in years. when i try to  i stutter  get tongue tied  forget what i was saying in the middle of saying. my mind is so off. barely feel human anymore  more like an alien trying to learn human speech and interaction. i was always bad at being social  because i was shy  because i couldn t find people i relate to. but now it s like  since it s been so long  i genuinely don t know how to speak properly anymore. i also just don t feel like expressing myself anymore either. feels exhausting and usually nothing much comes from me trying anyway. i still fail to make connections. i ve spent so much time on my own  it s hard to imagine sharing my space or thoughts with another person.,2022-01-19 20:54:36

61849,i don t know if this is the right place to write this but i need to write. i m 22 and have dealt with mental illness since high school my fianc   wife next month  has dealt with things worse than i have.   recently i ve been extremely depressed again since i m moving 7 hours away from family i m feeling isolated and alone again while also feeling like i m hurting my family by moving and i m a bad son for doing this.   a few nights ago my life was shattered when my fianc  was jumped and stabbed. she is ok and recovering but my mental health is now worse than ever after feeling like i d lose her. she s the only one who keeps me stable but with her having mental illness of her own plus this now i have no one to go to.   the worst of all is that this made me realize how emotionally abusive i am to her. i love her so much but i have been the worst making her feel alone and isolated while making her mental health worse. i never thought i was i always thought i was doing my best but she gets stabbed and tells me not to come visit her because i d make it worse. i m crushed but then i realize i would. i have done nothing but tell her how scared i was that i lost her and how i felt while she s laying there with staples in her stomach. i feel like a major dick and that i don t deserve her. i need help and i want to get better not only for me but for her. i hate that it took her getting stabbed for me to realize this but it did and i just want to get better. i don t want to make her feel like this anymore and i want to be there for her.   i feel like my world has been crushed and i have to face my feelings to overcome this and that scares the hell out of me. i m afraid of facing my feelings and facing myself. i just want to get better for me and her. i don t want to be emotionally abusive because she means the world to me but my depression gets in the way and makes me not empathize. i know i m a jerk and i act terrible but i m sorry. help,2020-09-04 11:40:07

7897,i have noticed that i often lack discipline and motivation when studying. i easily get distracted and end up procrastinating  which leads to feelings of guilt and frustration... the issue isn t with the subject that i m currently studying since i truly do enjoy the content  but rather the effort required to achieve my goals. does anyone else experience the same problem and how do you overcome it  many thanks in advance ,2021-10-02 12:57:18
1637,i got this a lot when i was younger. and it turns out that the shape of my face was looking good but my hair was covering it up in all the wrong places    if you wear a hat people can see the shape of your face and your forehead. if they usually don t tell you that you look goodbut do it everytime you wear a haty maybe you have to get rid of the hair in your face.   this does not apply for beards ,2021-04-16 04:21:38
4406,how do i accept a relationship that is not reciprocal  i have a family member that is close to me  i get to see her quiet often  however  our relationship is based on basically me listening and being there for her. whenever i tell her or share something from my life she listens to it for 2 seconds and then switches the subject. i don t feel seen  heard or valued. i ask her questions for the sake of a conversation going but i am tired. i wish the relationship was reciprocated. how do i accept this knowing i can t cut her off from my life ,2021-09-25 10:29:56
121301,i keep recalling of the times when i was young and when my family was still together. when me and my older brother were young  our mom would consistently tell us that our father was bad and evil and he does not love us and even to point of hate. it was an extremely toxic environment for a child to grow up in to be frank  and this left on me emotional scars that till today i remember clearly. this drove me and my brother apart from my father even though we stayed with our father after the divorce. in our teenage years  things got worst and worst with the relationship with our father. 2017 was the year i saw my father in a different light. i realized that he was extremely caring and loving unlike what out mother said. i have opened up my eyes and heart to my father and things got way better. to bad.. i couldn t say the same for my brother. after a certain incident  he stay with my mother after that. and just like that our family divided once more. i started to hate my mother because she brainwashed us since young to hate our father. and i could never forgive that. all the times wasted on hating what my mother portrait my father as.  as i ve matured i started not to take what my mother say to heart because i just cant trust her words anymore. but even though i did exactly that... she still manage to give me emotional trauma to me even though i m 19. she said things like  your father have never loved you when you were young. he only loved your brother  and also  if i knew how you 2 turned out  me and my brother   i rather not have gave birth to both of you.    frankly... there s alot of things going through my life.. i lost my girlfriend because i felt she was not there for me at all. whenever i had any problem and i told her about just for comfort  it became my fault. she blames me and guilt trips me. i lost myself along the way. and my closest friend that stabbed me in the back due to jealousy both within the same week. i m trying my very best to find myself again but with the things my mother say keeps lingering at the back of my head... its extremely hard to be happy at all. i keep thinking about it everynight. i wonder if it was better if we weren t born. i hate myself that i can t do anything about my family. i hate myself for being so naive. i hate myself for being to forgiving. i hate that i can t het through this alone.,2021-04-07 14:27:59
5095,for example  fixing their computer  editing someone s sheet  additional work that isn t particularly assigned to you  especially if at your job it s sometimes hard for people to automatically know what is in your responsibility and what isn t  without explaining. if you insist on doing it because you just want to help people  at least make it clear to them that you are taking over something that isn t your responsibility just because you want to help  but you won t do it again if you re busy or just not convenient for you. but be careful because you re setting up their expectation and they ll probably behave like it s your job  they won t appreciate it much  they won t say thank you and mad at you if you refuse to do it again. furthermore  if there s anything need follow up and check up  it will become your fault for anything bad that happens  like if they lost some files and their computer malfunction and it s all because you ve touched theirs  this time it will become your responsibility and it might interfere with your real assigned tasks,2021-07-19 08:10:54

1555, hey what s up  just a guy from europe looking for people  preferable from europe  to get known with and potentially become long term friends.  i like to talk about pretty much everything  but as with everyone  i have my boundaries. i m a mix between kind of serious and to not so serious. i can get along with basically anyone  as long as they re not toxic or just reply with 1 word all the time. i might not answer your message immediately  but i try my best to. there are various reasons as to why  like i might be busy doing something or just sleeping  but i try to answer your message when i have the time to do it.  it s no secret that i love gaming. my favorite games are valorant  r6s  apex and many others. i m more a competitive guy  but i can also play more casually. mostly just looking for a fun  casual time  and maybe doing stupid stuff too   . so we could totally play some games if you d like. i prefer using voice chat.  my other hobbies are watching anime  learning foreing languages  listenin to music. they re still very fun to do when i do get the time to do them. i m a pretty energetic and hardworking person  but have some days where i feel bit worse like everybody  i prefer to use discord  dont want to join any server ,2021-04-22 16:02:58
6667,in most cases all you ll need is a magnet. slide it along the wall as you would with a stud finder until you feel it stick to one of the nails in a stud. you can also dangle it from a short string like a pendulum until it sticks to or seems drawn towards a particular spot. any magnet of moderate strength should get the job done and will save you the 20  or more wasted on a cheap studfinder that you might not really need.,2021-08-29 08:31:43
81335,last year  i made a terrible choice because of my lack of knowledge related to my studies and career. and now i regret it more than anything else. later i had decided to become a scientist and i still think i am too passionate about it  but now it doesn t has any meaning in it for me. my fam doesn t has the kind of money that i can study in private colleges. and i do not want to be a burden in my parents lives  they work hard and do so much already.... i used to be a top student but now i have no idea what is going on. i have not been able to study anything and absolutely anything this year.... i feel lonely and sad and depressed. and how much so ever i try i can t accept that this is all my fault ... its just that... it was my teachers who made me take the decision  now i am suffering  i do not have any idea on what i am gonna do later when it comes to exams in a little while  i am depressed  lonely  and too much anxious. my heart feels so heavy  and it hurts really. there is an ache in my heart from this extereme anxiety when ever someone even mentions school  studies or exam.... i think those may be panic attacks but i can t tell anyone in my house  i dont know what to do. i just wanna die and end this.,2020-11-18 01:54:34
151663,my mi was getting worse and i lost my job because i had to take too many days off.  then i fell into a pit of depression for a month.  i thought if i found a new job i would feel better.  i got a job and after a day and a half i had to leave.  i couldn t do it.  i was a trembling sweaty mess from anxiety and my concentration was shattered.  the whole day and a half i was using every trick i know to stay sane and nothing was sticking.  i was totally overwhelmed.  now i don t know what i m going to do.  i know society at large wants me to contribute to capitalism or die trying.  but the few people who love me don t deserve to be hurt like that.  i really want to kill myself and get it over with  but i ve tried and it s harder than it looks.  i don t have a gun.  but i don t have any other solution either.  burden people while living or hurt them by dying.  this world is a fucked up place.,2021-07-25 11:48:33
27061,i literally just can t stand myself. i can barely communicate to others and they all fucking don t care. everyone thinks that just because i can manage to feel good one day that i m fine. i am not strong right now. i am so fucking weak. everyone has something else to worry about and something  else to do  like i am not suffering and i don t need help and guidance. i hate putting my depression on others  but people say they care and they re there for you when they never are,2020-05-02 17:27:35
158203,i honestly can t tell. i ve accomplished things in my life but always by relying on talent and only in an academic setting. i could handle college okay because it could be handled as a series of single tasks. write this paper  prepare this song  perform this concert  teach this lesson  etc. everything else  food  shelter  transportation  was handled for me. my only job was to be smart and talented. and i am. but  in  the real world   a phrase i fucking despise  i feel completely adrift and directionless. i can t handle work for sustained periods without wanting to just die. i ve never had any romantic or sexual relationships because of my anxiety and now  because i m a loser  i will never have them. i still live with my parents because i know i couldn t handle living on my own. i struggle everyday with the fact that i will always be viewed as a loser but i honestly have things to contribute to the world. i just can t do it in the way that our society expects me to. i m sorry this is such a rambling  incoherent mess. i think i m suffering from undiagnosed depression. i have a hard time believing it though since i know so many people that have depression and still manage to function much better than i do. honestly  i think i m just lazy and the only reason i m posting here is to be enabled in my shitty choices.,2021-08-17 05:44:03
85829,my wife is in a place many of you are all too familiar with  she is confused  depressed  hopeless  terrified and all too often thinking she simply cannot go on as she is. she s tried several anti depressants without success and she s currently on zoloft for several weeks now with no noticeable change. she has some better days  but the trajectory is more downward than upward. what i m asking is what should be expected from medications. do you wake up one morning and voila  you feel better  or does it require effort on your part to assist the medication. is there anything i should be doing to help her ,2020-12-01 12:50:34

5663,as the title says   if your brakes go out while you re driving  even kn an automatic car  you have one really great option to slow you down   the engine . sounds counter intuitive but engine braking is really efficient  it s the things semis lorries do when you hear them go  br br br br br br  and dump out a cloud of smoke as they slow down.   you can do that in your car too  as a last resort.   i know in the us that automatic cars come with a manual gear select mode generally labeled 1  2 and 3 or hi low. in newer cars it s just       as it functions like a standard manual transmission.   at any rate  if you lose braking power at speed  switch to manual mode and use the gears  starting in high gear  to slow down. the engine s resistance will absorb your forward momentum and slow you down. not nearly as fast as the brakes  but it will work.   thought about this after the brakes went out on my dads pickup the other day and we nearly hit a pedestrian because he couldn t stop. driving home we had no brakes and it hit me to use the engine.,2021-08-01 09:31:50
62428,this is my first time trying to speak about my shit so let s hope this works...  i ve recently started feeling scared of my own thoughts. during the day i would make suicide and depression jokes and then feel horrible about myself afterwards. during the night in the long sessions where i just stare at the ceiling  i have insomnia  i would get a lot of suicidal thoughts and then i would feel horrified about the thought that i might kill myself.  i feel like i am in the position to do something because i am able to realize how bad of a situation i am in right now but i can t get myself to do anything because  as other people have described it on this sub  depression feels sorta comforting.  i m interested whether what i m having is something rare unique or if others have had this too. if this isn t unique  i would be interested in researching a little bit into the topic  so if you have any articles i would read  i would appreciate it if you could share them.,2020-09-06 19:24:24

12536,hi all  my spouse and i recently had a discussion about our marriage and they admitted to being incredibly depressed and they do not feel anything about anything. they admitted that they had resented me for 3 4 years at this point. they admitted that they needed to fix themselves and would seek help  which is amazing and i m happy they have finally had that breakthrough. i feel like i have watched them suffer for years and tried to help as best i could but until they admitted it to themselves it was futile. here s the problem  i don t love them anymore  i care about them and want them to get help but in my head sometimes i have moved on. i did comfort them and let them cry on me and said  no matter what i still care about you.  i don t want to lead them on but didn t feel it was the time to discuss that i don t love them. i don t want to send them into a greater spin and maybe i just need to wait and see what happens. just looking for some advice. thanks guys  you rock ,2020-03-10 06:20:55

12093,context  homes are expensive. some say they are the most expensive thing you will buy. regardless of your level of income between spouses  one should be able to pay the entire mortgage payment reasonably during the month.   why this matters  life is unexpected. we do not know what comes tomorrow or the next day. being able to pay your mortgage on one person s income is financially responsible and critical. specifically  if your s o loses their job  is in an accident  you have a divorce  or anything that involves a single party to pay for an extended period of time   it is better that it is manageable.  notes  while a single payer is covering the mortgage  use the 2nd person s income to help pay off the mortgage or save more for these bad times.  additionally  taking on a 30 year mortgage decreases the monthly payment allowing for extra flexibility when times get rough.,2022-01-24 23:00:51

7408,managers love telling employees that they re always  open to suggestions  these days. a lot of leadership programs within the corporate world teach them that this is something workers want to hear  so they just say it without realizing what it truly means. the fact is  unless your manager is one of the very rare ones who doesn t have a fragile ego  they aren t   they are going perceive criticism as a personal attack. this applies at all times  but if the criticism is levied against them in a room full of their coworkers subordinates  it stands to hit them especially hard. this is just a fact of human nature. don t make yourself a target for retaliation  which is easy for them to get away with if they have half a brain.,2021-09-18 15:29:28

110709,updated   added  i honestly have no clue where to start   so if something seems out of order   please bear it will make sense. i am willing to take comments and answer any questions anyone may have.  here it goes..  my mother had two abortions  one before then after me  so i always have these constant questions in my head like    am i supposed to be here    am i the lucky fetus that made it   or some days  why me .  don t get me wrong  i am so grateful to be here and have the life i live  but my past childhood traumas are somewhat holding me back from evolving into my true self.    my grandmother is the root of all this abusiveness  and i will start here with her many of my childhood traumas have started and never ends with her.    my grandmother is the youngest of 4 children. she had a good upbringing  but she couldn t tell her mom some things such as  talking about periods  first time  or any girl issue you run into as a pre teen to teen due to her religion. so she didn t have the best relationship with her mother either   and my grandmother was not happy living with her mom so  in order for her to move out of her parent s house  she had to get pregnant and or  married   and so  she had my mother on september 4th  1970  best day of my future life . my grandmother was 16 years old and finally on her own and out of her mother s house.   fast forward 13 years..  my grandmother and grandfather divorced due to my grandmothers xanax addiction and party lifestyle  he couldn t keep up with her and her abuse. when my grandmother is under the influence of downers and alcohol  she gets very angry and mean and the things she says are unforgivable  but everyone gives her a chance hoping she will learn boundaries but  my grandfather is not the type to give someone a second chance  not even his own family. ever since then   my mother and brother were separated. my grandmother took my mother   and my grandfather took my uncle.  my mother grew up on your traditional american diet and wasn t the skinniest growing up . my grandmother was a double 00 and despised fat people  i am not even going to lie  she looked stunning in her two piece bikinis   but the way she treated my mother was unacceptable you never tear down your child and the whole time my mom lived with her mother was nothing but fat shaming her and  so you can try and imagine how this went for my mother. my grandmother would shove snickers in her face  literally   tell her that no one would love her  that she is her own birth control  and so much more horrific things.  during this time   my grandmother was a party animal  i m talking about coke addiction  xanax  orgys  random men in and out of the home  and so on. my mom had to eat dinners alone many nights and basically lived alone rasing herself while her mom went out and partied the whole instead of being present. my mother has expressed to me that she just wanted her mom s love and to be nurtured   but it never happened for her   and   i feel this is why she has a hard time showing giving me love   and i have a hard time giving showing love.   her traumas continued and progressed from the age of 12 to 16.  this drove my mom to leave her mothers house at the age of 16. she found a job and had to live in her car  roommates  or couch surfing. my grandmother was not worried about my mom and back then  especially in her 20s living life in the fast lane in the 70s. back then   everyone communicated by payphone  and one night   my mom was filthy  hungry  and just wanted a shower  and truly her moms love so  she decided to call her mom to see if she could stay there for the night and get cleaned up and leave the next day and not be a burden.   my grandmother responded to her and said  no  my life is actually a lot better eaiser now that you are no longer here    and she hung up on her. she was rejected by her mom.. again and this was way before me. she may have been 19 or older.   i am not sure but  this makes me feel that this is why it was so hard for my mother to be a parent. no  i am not trying to make excuses   but i don t know what s right or wrong or up and down. my mom was a new mother   and i can t imagine how hard it is to have kids but  on top of it keep her in our lives cause she had no one to depend on since my father was in and out of jail.   now i remember growing up   and for christmas one year  my dad was supposed to visit my mom and me. he was on probation at the time in and snuck off to see me and my mom. when he got there   everything was fine for a little while. i think i was maybe 3 years old  i was super young cause i remember my mom having to pick me up once to cops arrived and moved me into another room away from the situation   but  apparently my grandmother called the cops on my father to cause she knew he was coming over. she is evil  another time i remember is when my mom had to move in with her mother  my grandmother couldn t turn my mom down anymore because she had me. so she just moved in and was saving money to get us an apartment all while going to culinary school. during our stay   my grandmother and mom got into fights  my grandmother would undress me after my mom already dressed me just to piss her off and just petty shity shit.   my mom would tell me stories like when my mom would be so busy my grandma would have offer to watch me while my mom slept all day from working all night. one day she got so frustrated cause i went into her room  woke her up  and then he walked to my moms room and threw me onto my mom waking her up abruptly and said  take care of your fucking kid..      amp  x200b    amp  x200b   more to come in part two.,2021-02-17 22:38:56
144971,i applied for a promotion at work  one that s less technical than my current job and more client focused. i ve had jobs similar to the one i just applied for before in another industry and excelled at it.  i just had a phone interview with an hr rep from corporate. he indicated that i may not be  bubbly  enough  would a man say this to another man    and not exude as much confidence as they re looking for. no shit  i have depression and anxiety  the latter of which is on hyperdrive because it s a stressful situation. my meds didn t even put a dent in my anxiety today. but  if mr. hr guy had ever seen me in action with clients  as i do interface with them on a different level on a day to day basis  he d know that i am confident and reasonably energetic.   i m tired of my depression and anxiety holding me back. not to mention the frustration of being second guessed at every turn because of my sex in a male dominated field. i thought i was being confident and energetic during the interview  but my brain soup made me ramble a bit. i m so frustrated with myself.,2021-07-01 15:05:33
122208,hi  i m not sure how to start this  i barely use reddit however i need to get this thoughts out of my chest.     i hate my life and i m constantly find myself bored to death by it. i m so bored that i just want whatever god is up there to kill me. i at least used to be able to distract myself before covid by taking a random trip to somewhere or going outside but the regulations my country is taking makes it impossible to do  anything.       i m a relatively active 20 year old. i was raised as a professional ballerina before i quitted it at the age of 18 to pursue a different career and to attend university  yet i never truly quitted it and i m still doing ballet and other activities to pass time. these are usually the only time i ever feel... something. but it just an infuriating unbearable cycle that goes like this  i wake up  can t even find the motivation to prepare a breakfast so i force myself into an activity such as running or skating down at the beach however after a while that gets boring as well and i find myself rushing back home due to the overwhelming amount of anxiety i feel because it feels like i m being judged by everyone. yet when i rush back to safety  the overwhelming emptiness just... consumes me.     i messed everything in my life. i messed things up with my ex boyfriend  i messed things with my friends and my family  and i m just so lost and i have zero motivation to get my life back on track. on top of that the covid bs that is going on in our life makes everything ten times more unbearable. i was always an escapist to a faraway  adventurous  magical land and i d more than often would bury myself in books  movies or video games yet i can t even focus on things like those i used to enjoyed greatly.      i hate this so much and i can t find my way out of it and it makes me feel so suicidal that i can t function anymore...,2021-04-14 15:54:39
4410,source  bsc. horticultural science and former garden centre owner.   more often than not  well intentioned gardeners  indoors and outdoors  kill their plants with too much h2o.   the best thing you can do for  most of  your plants is let them dry out between watering.  there are certain types of herbs and ferns  as well as certain soil types that once dry have trouble taking in moisture again  but as a general rule  too wet is way more harmful than too dry.   if container gardening ensure your container is very well drained. i suggest a layer of pea gravel in the bottom to make sure drain holes stay open and don t get clogged by the soil. then use a good potting soil  appropriate for the plant type  that will stay moist longer  to slow feed moisture to the plant between watering. dense  rich soil seems great but it can quickly create an anaerobic  no oxygen  condition in the soil which can be deadly to the plant.   recognize the signs of drought  wilt  and water at that point but not before.   in addition to an unhealthy soil environment  plants that are overwatered are far more susceptible to disease  fungal infection  bacteria and root feeding insects like earwigs and harmful nematodes.   this is also true for your vegetable gardens  flower gardens and even lawns.   unless your plants are specifically known to thrive in wet soils  err on the side of drying them out between watering.   this promotes deep healthy roots  they go searching for water when they begin to get dry   healthy air gas exchange with the surface and minimizes disease stress.,2021-06-30 15:34:18

95042,i ve always been very resilient towards bad things in my life. never had it easy since i was a child. had to see many loved ones die  ended up going to 9 funerals before i turned 16. had to see my dad die when i was 11 and got bullied a lot. there were a few other things that went wrong in my life  like failed relationships  a failed engagement with my ex  losing my own dog  battling with marijuana addiction as a teenager and having a hard time finding my place in the corporate world because of some wrong educational decisions i did  studied the wrong topic .  against all odds i led a happy life so far and got a really thick skin towards bad things that can happen. but this life with corona is wearing me down. i didn t think it was possible  but i slowly degrade from a happy person to a mere shell of what i usually am.  the year 2020 hit me with a double tripple bitch slap. first my mom died of cancer  had to watch her suffer for 5 months and then see her take her last breath at her deathbed. stayed with her for 3 days straight until the end and held her hand . my family dog died shortly before that. he was such a good boy and a source of happiness for everyone. then i got a promotion which turned out to be a never ending nightmare of being shit on my management and being pushed to work overtime all the way. on top of that i had to deal with corona and everything that follows this pandemic.  the only real source of happiness i have left right now is my wife  i am not religious but god damnit bless her for her kind spirit   my brother and my old hobbies like video games and trash horrormovies.   now i start to feel really down. first christmas without my mom. i couldn t meet up with friends and had to spend the holidays alone. i can t travel anywhere because of the lockdown and all my other hobbies include things  which are either impossible during corona or are not advisable if you want to stay healthy. so i mostly just sit at home. days start to blend into each other. i sometimes wake up during the holidays and think  another day  just like the day before  and walk to the kitchen and make myself a coffee  sit on the sofa  slurp my caffeine and contemplate life while i look outside the window. i dread the 31st of december as it is my birthday and i am going to spend it alone with my wife at home  without friends or family.  i am really sorry for the long post. but i just felt like i needed to write it all down and put it somewhere outside of my head  before it consumes me.   amp  x200b   thanks for reading,2020-12-28 13:46:02

42546,i m not sure what the solution is either. i know it is a bit melodramatic to compare myself to some fictional character even if the creator engraved the show with his own depression but i can t help but feel that overwhelming self hatred.  idk what to do honestly and i m getting desensitized to my chosen jump location. i don t even want to jump anymore. not because i don t want to die but because i find myself just as asuka claimed shinji was for being weak  disgusting ,2020-06-25 01:49:09
146789,just reread this post and it s a little over the place  but it s late and i want to go to sleep so i ll just post it like this.  even as a little kid i didn t have interests. my mom used to get me to try different hobbies but i didn t like any of them. maybe that was an early sign of what was to come.  it s sad to see someone as young as me not doing anything other than going to school and to the gym. by the way  i haven t seen any progress in my body for years now despite lifting often  i just can t bring myself to eat 3000 calories a day because i don t have discipline. i ve only gotten physically stronger  so i guess i m the skinny guy lifting comically high weight at the gym. and while i m lifting  i m thinking of how i don t enjoy doing it.  i just don t feel joy from doing anything. i haven t been happy since i was a child  and even then i had my dark times. it s a shame  my parents have spent a lot of time  effort and money on me. so far  i ve managed to stay alive for them.  let s talk about friends  shall we  i don t have many.  i live in a small city of around 150000 people. it seems like everybody knows each other except for me. every time i go out with the little friends i have  who are  i believe  catching on to the fact that i only like hanging out when there s alcohol involved  they greet so many people  and i m the dumbass that s just standing there being sad.  i do want to get better  but i m in 4th year of secondary school  11th grade  and i think it may be too late to start building a personality. i m just a shell without interests or hobbies. i guess i can be kinda funny when i m drunk  so that s why my friends keep me around.  i m the only virgin in my friend group  which can get horribly depressing sometimes. i play it as a byproduct of being gay in a small city  but it s really just because i have no social skills and i don t enjoy being alive.,2021-07-07 22:49:35
98423,i am m16 and i ve dealt with having an insanely irrational mind that creates irrational beliefs and changes my memories to back up irrational fears. i ve never remembered a time when i did not struggle with irrationality. over the years i have learned ways to combat it and get better at controlling my mind. but that all changed when i started to have sex. every time i have sex i use a condom and i check the condom afterwards  but my irrational brain snuck itself back into my mind and is destroying my will to live. i just recently had sex with a girl and afterwards  like usual  i checked the condom  and it was perfectly safe  but when i grabbed my clothes  something like a pebble or etc. hit me in the face  i was in the backseat of my car sitting on the edge of the seat and the girl was sitting next to me laying down  as i was putting on my pants  my irrational brain told me  what if  just like that pebble was flung at you  your dick  with cum still on it from the condom  flung a drop of semen onto her pussy and got her pregnant  now this is completely irrational as i was sitting next to her and her ass was adjacent to me so it would literally have to curve in mid air to do so  but that did not stop my irrational brain from plaguing my mind with insane fear and anxiety  nonstop every day. every time i squash and rule out one irrational thought  another one appears in its place. after i finally squashed this irrational thought  then the thought   what if the condom wasn t safe   what if those folds in the condom were not folds  what if those drops of semen inside the condom were actually on the outside   the list of irrational thoughts keeps getting longer every time i erase one from the list and it seems like no matter what i do i can never get rid of them. i know it sounds absolutely stupid. i know it sounds absolutely crazy and insane. i know this yet i can t seem to rid my mind of these evil irrational thoughts and give my life peace.,2021-01-06 20:25:54
90638,this is going to be a long post  probably  so just bear with me on this one.  i have been struggling with depression for years now  and i feel like i am on the worst place i ve been in many many years. i am currently living abroad as an exchange student  living in my own apartment and basically living the dream i had been yearning for a long time now. well  as it turns out  it s not quite the dream i expected it to be.  more than a month ago  a mild lockdown was announced and enforced in the country  which confined me to my room with very few irl contacts since then. i hoped i would be able to meet friends more often  but sadly that wasn t the case  and that lead to a point where a few weeks ago i realized how lonely i feel here alone in my room. this  at the same time  made me realize that i have very few friends here  and it s just making it worse because i m fixating in them and i think i m starting to not behave normally with them because i overthink everything around them now.  the funny thing is that it s all getting much worse. a few days ago  a full lockdown was announced in the country  meaning that i won t be able to meet any friends anymore  and with christmas holidays incoming the prospect of spending them completely alone and isolated has severely affected me  to the point where i literally cannot stop ruminating about my loneliness and my problems. i am going to try to go back to my home country for the time being  but this means living behind some friends here who i may not see ever again because of the covid situation  and that s fucking me up greatly as well...  i have been on the waiting list for psychological counseling at my uni for more than two and a half months now  but i still haven t received a response at all. i have been trying to move into a university dormitory to avoid the loneliness and have people around me  but they have denied my petitions because of the lockdown  which i guess is fair but i cannot accept because i need to be around people. maybe they would have let me if i went to psychological counseling  but since they never contacted me  i think that s not a possibility now. the only thing i want is to spend the holidays here with my friends  but that prospect seems almost impossible now  and the only real option i have now is going back to my country  leaving behind everything and everyone i care about from my studies exchange  c. moreover  this also means i would have to take a covid 19 test before going back  and if it turns out positive  i will have to spend my birthday  christmas and new years completely alone.  all of this has led me to being suicidal for the past few weeks in an increasing rate  and the thoughts of it are very hard to silence now. i am incredibly lonely and i feel like i can t properly tell my friends about it because i m worried of both worrying and annoying them  and everything i care for is being ruined because of covid 19. i just want to be able to spend time around people  but i can t even have that and the endless maze of bureaucracy seems to be working hard to keep me from getting what i want  which is a basic human need... i am so close to giving up right now    tl dr    covid 19 has made me extremely lonely because of lockdown  and the prospect of the situation getting even worse is affecting me greatly  to the point of recurring suicidal thoughts as of late. everything i ve tried to do to stop it has failed and i m crushed  and the only options left are going to be very painful to me in one way or another.,2020-12-15 05:15:44
156548,i ve been diagnosed with major depressive disorder  or whatever it s called . things also haven t been going well in general. my girlfriend and i broke up the same day i lost my job  about three or four months ago. i was let go really harshly too. i was working as part of my county s covid response. real  essential worker  bs  especially considering how in the early days nobody really knew anything about the virus. plus  it s a unique situation  since if you catch the  rona  it s not just you who is at risk  it s your whole family.  they basically told us we d all have jobs as the county transitioned to a private healthcare company managing the sites  but that was a lie. up until the last day  they told us we d have a job either way  myself especially because the county  needed  people who could drive a box truck. the last day came  and we got a whole lot of nothing. even the people who did get hired by the private company quit within a week.  fast forward a bit  i recently revamped my resume  and wouldn t you know it  i got my first new job offer   it wasn t for the position i applied for  but the pay seemed good  and it had benefits. still  there were a lot of red flags. you can look at my recent posts if you want to see the details  but basically i felt weird about it  but hopeful.   turns out it was definitely a scam. great. i don t have to worry about losing my unemployment benefits  the job offer was part time where i d be pitted against the other applicant on a probationary period  with the hope of full time  but i now understand that it was just a tactic to create a sense of urgency. i was concerned that once i took the job on a probationary status  that i ultimately wouldn t be selected and would lose my unemployment benefits .  now i m just down. usually i d talk to my now ex  but we aren t on speaking terms anymore. the worst part about it is that for an evening  i really thought that maybe things were breaking my way. seriously  fuck people who prey on hope. they are the scum of the earth.,2021-08-11 03:01:21

3128,hello.   i went through couple of teacher s teaching  as i needed some guidance.   like tolle  who didn t made much sense to me  as he seems to approach enlightenment from a very singular perspective  or osho  who clearly had lots of strong  personal opinions for an enlightened being.   and i also tried adyashanti. and there are some of his teachings i didn t agreed with in the past  but yeah  over time  as i progressed  almost  everything i doubted turned out to be true.   especially  the end of your world  turned out very helpful.  so i just wanted to add my five cent and strongly recommend him for anyone feeling confused.      there s just one minor red flag remaining   in one of he s teaching he talks that it s possible to gain healing powers through meditation  but i m just deciding to ignore it for now.,2021-07-13 19:12:49

49497,i m 21  i feel i should be over this heartbreak stuff by now. my partner of 6 months just broke things off  we lived together the entire time which makes it more difficult for me. because of covid i ve only kept in touch with my housemates and i don t feel comfortable at home right now so i feel like i have no one. i was extremely emotionally dependent on her and even partially identity dependent on her. i don t know who i am  what i like  how to be myself. i know there s something so fucked up about me that makes me so tangled in people. now for the lonely months of mental self abuse on myself while i struggle to get better  not finding a partner because my self esteem is too low so i latch onto them like a fucking leech. but i feel zero validation unless a woman is telling me i look nice or i m cool or worth something. i m depressed when i m alone and extremely anxious i ll be left when i m taken  m i m never happy.,2020-07-19 13:01:14
34195,so i ve had diagnosed depression for a good while. i ve been morbidly obese for as long as i can remember. i ve been antisocial the majority of my life. and i ve been unambitious in developing useful skills or a career.  i ve been on all kinds of medicine  had plenty of councelling  many diets  or other eating habit lifestyle changes   and i ve come  out of all of it having not changed in the slightest  resistant to every step of it.  from what my friends and therapists say  it all comes down to what i truly want. if i can find what i want  i can fight for it without holding back. but apparently what i want is to be lazy. i want to eat the food i like with no restrictions. i want to work on nerd projects alone in my bedroom. i apparently want nothing else. i say i want to live healthy  some day get a girlfriend  find a better career  but i think i just want the benefits of those things  not the things themselves.  so i ask  how do i change what i inherently want  i cant find an answer for that  and i ve been coming to the conclusion over the past few months that there isnt one. so what do i do  if deep down  i dont want to change  i accept that i won t.   hell  even if i did  there s no going back on some of these things. even if i lose a ton of weight  i ll still have so much loose skin. gone is any chance that i ll have anyone find me remotely attractive  not that i can socialize enough to find anyone for a relationship of some sort.   so that seems to be it. i accept the crappy hand that i dealt myself  be as content as i can with it  and die in my mid 30s from some inevitable health complication. am i wrong ,2020-05-26 15:58:41
6001,hey all  let me start by saying that i have a long history of depression  anxiety  panic attacks and trauma.  last year around this time my depression was very bad  i read a book on mindfulness based cbt  meditated for the first time  i had tried 2 3 times before  but didnt get it  and experienced what i can only explain as a jhana state. it was an immense joy i felt in my body  especially in stomach area  and at some point it got so intense i had to stop.      after that for a couple of days i had the clear sensations of lsd in my head. i dont do drugs anymore  but those who have done it  know the certain sensations it creates in your head. almost like squeezing. well i had those feelings  and in general a clear psychedelic state of mind. like i was on a microdose. anyway  this all happened a year ago  i got heavily involved with buddhism after this incidence  and meditated a lot.      at some point i stopped meditating but it was always on my mind  and i picked it up 3 days ago again  as i was suffering badly from depression. yesterday as i was meditating  i cultivated a somewhat deeper concentration  mindfulness and so on. afterwards i started getting those psychedelic like effects again. but this time around it started making me detached from reality  and also somewhat manic. today i tried meditating again but had a panic attack. what is weird is my depressive state is gone  i m kind of detached from my suffering  and everything else too. and i got scared of going insane if i chose to go on. it feels like the state of coming down from psychedelics  where nothing makes sense  your mind is slow  you re detached from reality and etc. what makes me scared of mindfulness is what if i go too deep and get lost in there.     also need to add i never did a lot of lsd. maybe 6 7 doses in my life  and 4 5 microdoses. i ve had some very nasty experiences on it  but i dont think i have any lasting damage.,2022-01-04 21:40:40

7363,preface  this may not apply to all copay assistance companies so speak to a representative at the copay assistance program.   if you have a limited fund copay assistance  x  per year  and are able to submit receipts to the copay assistance program for reimbursement its best to not use your copay assistance to pay for your medication directly.  in speaking with my copay assistance rep  they recommended that i remove my card from file with the pharmacy. have the health insurance company pay for the medication and charge me the remaining amount. by doing so it goes against your deductible and you pay out of pocket. you then submit your out of pocket expense to the copay assistance program for reimbursement.   you will receive cash back in full for your out of pocket expenses and meet your deductible and out of pocket maximum faster.  backstory for reference   my copay program only provides  20k a year in assistance. medication is  29k  pre insurance  every 8 weeks. after going through insurance remaining cost is around  5k.   option 1  what i was doing   used copay assistance 4 times to pay for medication and ran out of assistance. no facing a  3300 bill for the next dose of prescription which will need to be paid out of pocket.  options 2  what was recommended by copay   remove copay card and pay out of pocket. submit payment for reimbursement. meet deductible and out of pocket maximum by 2 prescription.  5 per dose out of pocket due copay. copay assistance used total   10k. with my insurance remaining health related items will be covered 100  for rest of year.   note  you cannot use your hsa to pay and request reimbursement from copay assistance  hope this is clear enough and helps someone else save money and out of pocket expenses for medication.,2021-09-17 13:59:02

6001,the best measure of understanding is that you can repeat someone s position back to them in a way they could be fooled into thinking you agree. if you can t present someone s position in such a way  it means you don t understand it fully.  and this works both ways. if you want to make sure someone understands your position  ask them to explain your position back to you. it quickly reveals which parts they re struggling to understand.,2021-08-10 05:13:47

24940,i ve have not been well for some time now. i think i can pinpoint it to when bernie dropped  because that cemented that the nothing will slow down the global march to global collapse caused by exponential consumption at least for another 4 16 years.   people can tell me anything they want on reddit  that i should quit my job  or that i should go to art classes or that they will even be my friend  but that won t change anything. i can quit  and then i ll be out of money in 2 months. if i couldn t find a paying job in the 6 since since college  what hope do i have now. the only person i feel like who has gone out of their way to make me feel better is my father  but even he isn t good with understanding my depression or my inability to accept how cruel the world is to live in.   i often switch between desperately wanting a real life person talk to and remembering that everyone i know doesn t know how to deal with my depression and or is being burned alive by their own miserable existence.   everytime i try to look for a way to improve my life  i just remembered all the reasons why that didn t work the last time i tried. all the things i ve tried  medications  doctor s  dating apps  gym memberships  sleep studies  nerd groups or art classes. everything has either stopped working over time or left me so burned out that i never wanted to do it again. every improvement in my life has been met with an equal weight to keep me depressed.   i don t fucking know. i don t know if anyone could help me  if i could ever even get better. fixing depression is hard  but i feel like my entire life has been being in a jail if emotions or burden of capitalism that doesn t even allow me to start working on it. i think that the capacity for love is completely erased from my brain  if it was ever there to begin with.   i don t think anything can be done  that s where i left off last i did this  just accepted that the rest of my life would be waiting to die.,2020-04-25 11:52:49

68220,   quoted for context i guess     gt my wife died a month ago. the trauma made me hospitalized for almost a week for transient heart failure and pneumonia. being hospitalized traumatized me further. after discharge  friends and family took turns babysitting me to make sure i don t relapse or become suicidal. missing days of work   no pay. family and friends start to feel the financial pressure.    gt     gt my work  family  friends  hobbies  pets  all of it does not interest me or bring me joy as they once had. everyone describes me as a strong responsible person  but i m not the same anymore and wish to die everyday. most days i want a relapse and suffer cardiac arrest. worse days i contemplate taking my wife s keys and driving the car into a tree or off a cliff      counseling hasn t helped.   talking with friends and family hasn t helped.   being alone   definitely   hasn t helped.   i don t really want to take pills to function or use anti depressants.    my sister has been waiting for a reason to 5150 me  and frankly  maybe that s what i want.   being forced into therapy and medication i don t want. housed in a place i can sob just exist because i really don t want to do anything else for the rest of my life. unfortunately  i don t know the costs of being in such a fine institution for the rest of my life  and i don t want to burden my family with that.    in my mind  once my wife s heart stopped  my time stopped too.    so i just feel like i m floating around in this stressful wasteland just trying to exist  but life wants me to be a functional part of society already and be  responsible  with the life that i have. in my mind  i no longer have a life and am just living on borrowed time because i literally do not want to do anything because everything reminds me of what i used to have with my wife. i ve researched and even contemplated if i should just learn the dnm bible and trying my luck with all that. one of my more understanding friends said maybe a goal for me is to save and get to switzerland for the assisted suicide thing. i wish this was more available in the us. i m just thankful the a very select amount of friends understand how much pain i am going through and that i do not want to be here anymore.   i m agnostic so whether i go to heaven or hell is beyond me. i don t even mind if i don t get to see her in the afterlife cause it s just darkness or nothingness or whatever. i just want to stop suffering here all alone without her.,2020-09-29 13:38:35

4276,while food sensitivities also play a role  consuming food and drink in smaller amounts and slower has been truly life changing for me.  i used to be a guy that would eat 2lbs of food  think rack of ribs or burger type meal with beer  in under 5 minutes easily. i would feel bloated for days and sometines even a little sick  looking back  i can t believe i had no clue the amount of stress this put on my system.  now i hardly feel the way i used to  even when eating heavy meals. i do still sometimes eat large portions  like family gatherings   but in these scenarios  i make sure to eat over the course of an hour or two if possible.,2021-06-27 16:49:31
7526,my father dated an oncology nurse for a few years. she worked with a lot of patients  young an old  that had just received a terminal diagnosis. none of them ever said they whished they had spent more time working. most said they whish they had spent more time with their kids family  more time pursuing hobbies or passions.  i manage a team at work now and try to instill this in the people i manage. work is important for you to be able to eat retire when you want  etc. don t forget the relationships you re building with family and friends. those are more important than anything you do at work.,2021-09-22 02:38:50

165670,when you start feeling sad and depressed  your friends will call and text and try their best to be there  but with time they stop.  they don t get it that your episodes of depression or suicidal is not temporary or a one month thing  so they start getting busy with life and bored to be around someone too crazy emotionally and dark.  i m not feeling bad that they are  they deserve good things i love them..  but that just proves to me how lonely i m  its only me in this world  i have no one and survival is gonna eat me alive.,2021-09-13 09:39:04
5728,there s nothing better than being openly attentive in meditation. nothing. the depths are there to unravel  not in any energetic journey or mystical vision realization. one path glazes your eyes  however beatific the glaze may be. and the other  you keep yourself here. in this world. and not an abstraction of it until your death. can you go through life without creating unnecessary filters ,2021-12-18 22:52:02

190359,this is just so disheartening to me. a couple weeks ago i started making some major lifestyle changes and i finally got to the point where i was feeling better. and now i m starting to lose this zest for life that i have found. i ve quit smoking marijuana  quit cigarettes  but i am vaping at the moment   started working out again  practicing yoga and meditation  trying to learn guitar  and have been studying music production. i do struggle a bit with loneliness  but i still see family and friends on a pretty regular basis. right now i honestly feel lethargic and a little numb like i did when i was smoking weed. i honestly just don t get it. any advice would be much appreciated ,2021-12-09 18:23:14

2400,hello boys and girls i just joined this reddit and wanted to tell my story i m 21 yrs old living with my parents when i go out to hang out with my friends and it s getting late my parents always call me on the phone and ask me what time it is and to go back i m obeying them so that i don t have to argue with them. what rly bothers me tho is that when i ask my friends on messenger to go out and have fun they are literally not answering me but they read my messages that i send to them then a couple of hours later when it s too late for me to go out i m receiving a message from them telling me if i want to go out with them. today i asked them if they are free to hang out so that we can meet for one last time because tomorrow they will leave for england and no one bothered to answer me i sent them so many messages and again no answer a couple of hours later i got a message from them if i want to go out with them at 20 00 21 00 pm when it s too late for me to go out if i literally change my clothes and my father sees me getting near the door he will ask me where i m going and will tell me to get back because it s late why they can t understand it that i can t go out and hang out with them at the night i m not asking for too much i just want to go out with them earlier and when the time for me to come back home arrives i m gonna leave them while they are still gonna stay outside and have fun i know that it sounds selfish and that they don t have to change their plans and go outside earlier because of me but atleast do it once for me am i asking too much from them i swear to god i had enough of them atleast don t ask me to go out with you when it s too late just don t send me messages at all because now that you send me messages you re actually triggering me. that s all i had to say i hope you didn t had a stroke trying to read it because i m not used to use punts and commas xd,2021-05-20 12:20:10
662,i see many apologizing for leaving early or coming in late due to genuine reasons. use sorry when you are wrong or when you feel for someone s condition. you shouldn t be sorry for leaving early when you aren t feeling good or if there was a delay in replying to the email without your fault.   not saying sorry doesn t make me you sound rude. it makes you sound confident  practical and increases the value of your  sorry ,2021-03-04 03:26:00
172327,of course i want to live  it s inherently in all of us to  want  to live. but i fucking hate where i am in life right now. not only is it stale and boring  it s somehow fucking painful. i hate everything about my life for the past few years. every. single. aspect. do you know how painful that is     i hate being me. i hate having no money. i hate having no genuine people to talk to. i hate being in this country. i hate not knowing what my future is. i hate the fact i m completely lost in school and my career. i hate the fact i m behind time. i hate everything.    i wish i could wake up and have better problems. which sounds so stupid  but i m so sick of having to deal with the same problems for years. no matter what i do its never enough. somehow my effort is always never enough  i m never trying hard enough  i m never good enough... ugh.... i m so stuck and lost and alone. i hate this disgusting feeling.,2021-10-07 13:27:20

52263,i am a 22 year old white man. unsurprisingly enough  i ve had a very privileged life. i have always been a motivated person with a very good work ethic. however  for the past year and a half  i have had cycles of depressive episodes and have lost jobs and relationships accordingly. i recently booked an appointment with a local psychiatrist.  first  i will tell you about my depressive episodes. i will go through periods where all i want to do is my college schoolwork  go to work  exercise  meal prep  socialize  etc. i want to be active all day every single day. this will last for a period of approximately 3 months. every 4th month  i will fall out of my elevated mood and energy levels and resort to staying in my room all day  every single day. i will have absolutely no motivation to do anything or see anyone  not even my girlfriend of 2 years or my parents  whom i have good relationships with .  second  i will tell you about my alcohol usage. i grew up in a town of 3000 out in the middle of corn and bean fields. without much to do during high school  it was very common to drink heavily at young ages most days out of the week. it was also very common to  booze cruise.  these activities were commonplace for me in high school  and when i moved away for college  i found myself many times drinking and driving between bars on a fake id. 3 months into 21 years of age  and  unsurprisingly  i get a dui.  i thankfully got put on a court ordered program that required me to take some aa classes  stay sober for a year  and i had my license revoked for 30 days. for the first month or so i would say i was saddened to not continue the life i was living. i wanted to go out and drink with my friends  and i did feel a little lonely because up to that point all social activities revolved around some drug or alcohol. when they were stripped away...what was left to do  i made it through that year  and still drink socially if i so desire.  i told him i shared a bottle and a half of wine with my girlfriend over movies on sunday  and i just saw him today which is wednesday. apparently  that is too much and is indicative of alcohol dependency. so...  my psychiatrist refused to see me because he believed i struggled with an alcohol dependency and not a psychological disorder.  however  these depressive episodes continued on a pretty specific cycle during my year of sobriety with absolutely no triggers whatsoever. i would quit my jobs  stop talking to everybody  and sleep 12 hours a day.  i would like to believe i would know if i struggled with alcohol. there have been times in my younger years it could have caused me physical harm and times it came in between my relationships and friendships. at this point though  the extent of my drinking is having that 3 4 bottle of wine over movies  and maybe having a couple too many at a bar with my friends. which is  by the way  not that abnormal for a guy my age in college.  i am an extremely rational thinker  all my studies focused in science and math.  and i know for a fact that my depressive episodes have no correlation with how much i am drinking at the time.  i just need opinions on this situation. should i seek another psychiatrist  or is it likely most will say the same thing  is it possible that drinking drug usage is still my problem  even though my episodes continued through my sobriety  which  in case i forgot to mention  was no issue at all besides the fact my social life took a hit    thanks for reading. sorry it s so damn long. i m also sorry if this isn t necessarily the right thread  i didn t know where to post.,2020-07-29 22:12:13
41973,i m only at peace when i am sleeping. this life is pointless and i hate myself. i don t even having anything to self harm with. i just feel like breaking down. i have no satisfaction in this life. no friends  no love  no life  nothing. i am fucking worth nothing. all i can think about is a way out this life. a part of me just wants to just feel happy but i am so tired of this. why was i born if this is the brain i have. i am so fucking despicable to look at and miserable to be around. i wish i was worth it.,2020-06-23 02:08:56

1078,so recently back in december my friend got a new flashy nice car. from that time to now he has grown distant and completely stopped hanging out with me. he s not inviting me to beaches  nature hikes etc.. we always used to do those stuff. we used to go to the beach river  long drives with my car etc.. around the same time in december i linked him with a high paying job also  a very nice job i got for him. i also work the same job .  thought that would make us bond even closer working for the same company but no .  i don t see how he could ve have been using me for my car all this time. his girlfriend would tag along with us also. i gave my friend everything  birthday presents  help with money  rides back home from work.  i don t say bad things about anyone  however  am a bit socially awkward but it isn t that bad...basically neglibile. we have been friends for 3 years now. also  about a year and a half ago he broke up with his girlfriend and apparently she liked me so we dated for a couple of days until they got back together again immediately.  lt    it can t be that because we hanged out a lot after this incident. is he afraid he will lose his girlfriend to me since it s known she likes me also  highly doubt it because he would let me carry her out to run errands before he got his vehicle since we have built alot of trust within our friendship.  he also has video game night where friends would come and play video games for hours and not once was i invited.  also it doesn t seem as if i m invited to his upcoming wedding after everything i have done for him   why would my friend stop hanging out with me and stop wanting to see me after getting a new car and nice job  does he think he s too good for me now ,2021-04-01 11:39:55

61230,i run into this pattern where everytime i m stressed for long periods of time  i gain a lot of weight and inevitably end up being unnecessarily hard on myself over every single thing i do  as i tell myself that i look disgusting. i also end up binging on unhealthy foods due to stress. i can t believe i was  finally  improving upon my body and self image just last october in my thirty years of living  and here i am  again   becoming the self loathing alcoholic fuck that i revert back to when shit is falling apart. i haven t been sleeping well  and i generally look like shit everyday when i look in the mirror. social skills are also falling apart. i am paranoid of the idea of going out to socialize with friends for fear of catching the virus. i am sick of dealing with my mental illness as everyday feels like a losing battle. i don t understand how i am supposed to succeed in life when i am fighting my demons and struggling to love myself. i m so tired of struggling. i miss the boxing gym i frequented last year but it won t be opening for a while due to problems with inspections and city regulations in manhattan. and i know for sure there is no other gym that can help me like that one did. gyms in nj are opening starting tomorrow but the idea of going to your average gym is making me more depressed. i would be putting myself at risk of catching the virus especially if someone decides to take his her mask off or spread their germs all over the equipment. i don t want to deal with the idiots i dealt with at planet fitness. i don t even know if the gym i went to before will even be around next year  with these issues in mind. i don t want to go out and put myself at risk but i also don t want to stay home all the time  feeling like a coward. i m already averse to risk taking. risking catching covid is piling more anxiety on top of my existing anxiety and depression. i don t know how to be happy. i am finding that i just loathe people for not helping the numbers go down. people are really out there partying  spreading the fuckin virus  and i just cannot stand it.,2020-09-02 01:37:25

4949,hey  i m at such a point in my life where i have some time to talk  but a lot of people seem to have normal busy lives  so it s difficult to bond  especially given the time difference.  i m looking for a fellow adult  sorry for caps   who s open minded towards audio conversations  on an app . it could be entirely anonymous  no video   but i m sadly not huge on texting  hence my preference for voice  which i find to be a more human like medium and experience. i can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have  from my end i would do everything i could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.  general interests  literature  art history  philosophy  psychology  economics  languages  geography.  music  all over the place   seafret  m83  philip glass  lord huron  radiohead  sigur ros  mogwai  of monsters and men  yndi halda  god is an astronaut  godspeed you black emperor  keaton henson  laura marling  max richter  if these trees could talk  clint mansell  some songs of sia and adele  and many other artists. if you don t recognise some of those names  it could be a plus  because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.  literature  non fiction  microhistory  biographies  geography and culture   fiction as in sci fi  mystery  thriller  subtle philosophical supernatural horror. i m more of a prose person  though i do appreciate some poetry from time to time. i might not be really refined for it  i find narratives extremely compelling  especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. i prefer contemporary prose  althought i have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics  mostly  western  sadly   both for school and out of my own curiousity. when it comes to psychology  my horizons were influenced partly by viktor frankl  erich fromm  rollo may  and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. favourite philosophers  i haven t read a lot of primary sources  but i did find reading schopenhauer  sartre  camus  benatar  challenging  in a positive way . philosophically speaking  my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. recently i ve developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti natalism and abortions debate  so if that interests you  we could discuss those.  movies and tv series  haven t seen one in a while  but i used to like black mirror  sherlock  house  futurama  elementary  and a few others. broadly speaking  i like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition  that s why i tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.  i watch quite a lot of youtube  educational  popular science channels  booktube  social commentary  some podcasts. i m quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.  a bit more about me  depression issues and anxiety  a bit socially conservative  do not play any videogames. i m a bit of a bookworm  and i tend to talk about lofty  ivory tower ideas  but some have told me that i do possess a sense of humour  which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments .  i suppose  i m looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. it d be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. i hope i do not sound very entitled  putting forward all these things about the  ideal  person to find on here. my rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection  if any  depending on what you think  after finishing reading my post .  i ve posted this quite a few times  so my sincere apologies to the not first time readers.  thank you for reading this. feel free to pm me.,2021-08-13 00:58:16
10708,my wife mocks me  lovingly  for keeping a go bag in my trunk. i recently had abdominal pains at work and had an emergency appendectomy. guess who strolled into the er  ok  hobbled in and practically crying  with a gym bag with pyjamas  tooth brush paste  glasses  warm socks  device charger and headphones.   honestly  it made my life easier as i could be as comfortable as possible without making my wife run around putting stuff together and running the gauntlet of covid screening to drop stuff off for me.,2021-12-21 07:20:48

86344,lately  i ve just been...hurting. a lot. i ve had depression for some time and in the beginning  it sucked  later on  it got a little better  but now it s jumping back at me. i can feel the cold hand of depression and suicide brushing up against my cheek. i have a good feeling about what the cause of my current depressive state is and i won t lie when i say i m a bit afraid of saying it because i think what i ll say is wrong and should be posted elsewhere but this just seemed like the most logical place to put this.  recently  i went through a break up with my girlfriend and what really hurt about it was that this person was a true confidant. though i had several talks with myself about should the break up occur  i d be prepared but no matter how much i  prepared  myself for the worst  it would always just cause feelings of anxiety within myself and even though i trusted this person with my life  i was always scared to bring it up because i thought i d appear weak. this person gave me a purpose to live and made me happier than i ve been in a while. now that they re gone  i feel like i have no one else to talk to and sometimes a spectre looms over me. haunting me. i have a few friends and i know they ll listen but i m just so afraid. i m afraid the worst will happen. that they ll think of me as weak and want nothing to do with me so i bottle it up and it hurts. i m afraid i m a burden all the time. i know i don t want to die  i just want to stop feeling to pain but it s so hard. i m afraid. i m even afraid now posting this because i feel it leaves me vulnerable and i don t want to be hurt. i don t want to be alone. i guess the bottom line is i m afraid to be abandoned and hurt.,2020-12-02 22:33:23

4455,hello    so in exactly nine days my friend future roommate and i are going to be touring an apartment and...we kind of have to get it. we both have pretty awful home situations and  long story short  i cannot live here anymore and my friend can t live at his house anymore  hence the urgent need to move out.   so  we started looking for apartments a long time ago and only just now have i even found one that s available soon. it was one of the first apartments we were considering and it ll be available on august eleventh which is great because i m supposed to be out by september.  so we kind of  have  to get this. there are no other options. so what can we do to make a really good impression on the people who work there    i know credit history is really important  and i m freshly eighteen so i don t have much but my current score is 685  i ve had my card for two or three months  i think. also  my parents and his parents both offered to cosign and i know my parents have really good credit. but as this is our first apartment we don t have any rental history which i m nervous about.   any tips for getting our application approved  thanks ,2021-07-01 18:40:25

171027,i ve had depression since i was 13. i was diagnosed with an illness that resulted in the removal of my large intestine and a permanent illeostomy. in the same six months i learnt my father was not my father and that my parents were getting a divorce.   i m on medication for it but i ve just hit a massive slump recently. i want to be a registered nurse but i m failing out of school  if i don t pass this semester i m booted. honestly  i stopped being driven along time ago. now i m just going with the motions of life.   i have held down a job since i was 14 and i thrive in the workplace with often positive feedback.   every day i wake up and beg the universe for an accident that just ends it. even towards the end i m still a chronic people pleaser. i would hate to disappointment my mum  at least with an accident she wouldn t know how bad it is.   i should be happy  i have a loving spouse  a roof over my head  a well paying job. we are getting married next year and currently building our first home together. i know i don t really have anything to complain about.   i have all these loving people in my life but i can t tell them anything.... my mother was a teenage mother and gave up her future for me. my sister subscribes to tough love. the person i do normally talk to  just lost a family member. so i don t want to bother her in her grief.   i wanted to self harm today. i haven t done that in years.,2021-10-02 19:38:54
164569,i feel like our current society promotes shaming those who mess up. small mistakes and imperfections lead to those around you tearing you down.   either you take advantage of others and prevent yourself as the alpha or get beaten down upon for the amusement and benefit of the strong. it boggles me as to the lack of morals in our society.   this behavior is incredibly common in schools and is causing severe mental issues in many kids. its a miracle anyone gets out of there alive not to mention the internet which is significantly worse due to people saying whatever they want with no repercussions.   why do people genuinely enjoy harassing people  why must we hate each other for differing opinions and small imperfections   are depressed people just realists and understand how screwed up we all are ,2021-09-08 23:50:41

37664,it s been two years since i gotta was cured of my depression using therapy and zoloft. for one and a half months i cared about absolutely nothing and saw no meaning in anything because it will all be gone one day. it was not fear of death  it was a realization of reality and the lack of inherent meaning. i saw how fast it seems life had been moving  and realized how you will eventually be at any point in time no matter what  which means everything is meaningless. i didn t do any activities i enjoyed and was unable to stop thinking about how scary and meaningless and hopeless everything is. i barely ate and did nothing more than pace around thinking and panicked for one and a half full months. i truly did nothing except research death and time and feel panicked about our fleeting existence. it was hell. i could barely sleep because my brain raced so much with terrible thoughts  no suicidal thoughts however. i even tried drowning out my thoughts with blasting music but i was just so very sad and hopeless. i eventually recovered but still struggle with the ideas i had  but i am overall much happier and able to actually live again. now that i have tried my best to explain the worst time of my life  i m curious. has anyone else had a similar experience or even just related  i feel so alone with my feelings  as my parents hardly understood them as i did  and i know of no other kids who gave been through anything similar  although i surely wouldn t know because they wouldn t go around telling people. what are your thoughts on this  is this a freak occurrence  am i alone with these thoughts and ideas at such a young age  thanks in advance to anyone who read this whole thing and cares enough to answer.,2020-06-08 00:47:29

142277,i have sporadic dips into depression that causes my mind to emotionally abuse itself.  an example of this is one that occurred very recently. i was fixing myself a plate of food trying to be nutritional by incorporating greens  water and whole foods. hoping the healthy meal will help my mood  instead a thought suddenly came into my head    you don t deserve food . my mind raced to find rational in this idea. after a few moments i concluded that food is for someone who has a purpose and goals in life and that that food will help keep that person alive to achieve their goals. i don t have any purpose in life at the moment  therefore i don t deserve food.,2021-06-21 22:19:21
34022,i had my first session and basically gave a run down on my life. i was diagnosed with major depression and generalized anxiety and ptsd in the past but those symptoms flared up again and was worse. i had a accident in my life where i was severely assaulted and got my car stolen. this assault left me with broken teeth  fractured left jaw  and fractured chin. i had to get surgery and i was never the same after that incident  basically went into deep depression. i had hiccups in my school and job due to the accident. constantly on edge and having panic attacks. always becoming aggressive when stressed out. i explained this to my psychiatrist and he noted everything and decided to give me prazosin  ptsd meds  for the nightmares and see how i do. second session comes around and i told him that my sleep is okay now and no nightmares but i have the feelings of depression anxiety and just being angry still. he gets offended and tells me that my age is a factor and young adults like me shouldn t even feel depressed or anxious and i m still young and have nothing to worry about. not many young people go through a difficult time like getting assaulted and your jaw broken. it s always constantly in the back on my mind and have been hospitalized because i was having suicidal ideations about how much pain i was in. my face doesn t look the same as before and i deal with insecurity about it. now i m diagnosed with zoloft for the depression  anxiety  and ptsd. i just feel overwhelmed with being prescribed prazosin and zoloft at the same time. it seems like i m not resolving the issue but just solving it with the pills. he didn t really give me a answer for all this  just take the meds as told.. i was also on lexapro in the past but it didn t do much but clear my mind but it never solved the overthinking i still had. could be the chronic pain from my face jaw causing me to relapse  also this is va healthcare if any of you guys are familiar with it.,2020-05-26 01:33:15

185340,tw  suicide  self harm  substance abuse   i  22 f  never thought i would make a post to this subreddit and no one will probably even read this but i ve found myself in a pickle here. this is my first time posting so bare with me here  i apologize for such a lengthy post. my boyfriend  24 m  of 9 months broke up with me two days ago over individual mental health issues that we ve both been dealing with internally on our own during our entire relationship.   i am diagnosed with quiet borderline personality disorder  major depressive disorder  and dependent personality disorder and have dealt with self harm and suicidal tendencies in my past  i have recently gone back to therapy treatment 4 months ago  but haven t noticed much improvement since. i have a very difficult time forming and maintain relationships with anybody  i have a very difficult time with words and expressing myself and tend to be a very quiet person in general  i also bottle my feelings so i don t come off as a burden to others. i also have the tendency to copy other people s personalities as a coping mechanism to fit in and be more likely to be accepted by others. i also tend to obsess over my boyfriends and relationships to an unhealthy degree  usually placing my person of desire on a pedestal.  i have been in 2 abusive long term relationships prior to my current relationship which have both ended in me being abandoned  the first one was a 3 year relationship that ended with him ghosting me for practically no reason and verbally abusing me over text whenever i tried reaching out to him to talk about it  the second was a 4 year relationship with my physically abusive ex fianc  with schizophrenic traits that i broke off a year ago because he slept with my best friend in front of me  failed three some attempt  and decided to move in with his mom to a different state without telling me about it  my best friend helped him pack his bags  neither of them told me    because of my horrible experiences with relationships i was reluctant to even start dating again and did not want to originally be in a relationship with my current boyfriend  now ex  when he fell in love with me i felt guilty for not reciprocating the feeling back so i decided to give him a chance. he has his bachelors in psychology and knew about my depression at the beginning of the relationship and told me he has dealt with his own struggles with depression as well  so we both made a pinky promise to each other in the beginning that we would never cut ourselves for the sake of each other  though i would dance around this rule by hurting myself in other ways.   at first things were great  he gave me everything my previous relationships lacked  he gave me tons of affection  took me out places and would show me off in public  things i ve always wanted to do but couldn t with previous lovers  so i began to genuinely fall in love with him slowly  but i ve always been quiet around him  too nervous to do or say anything that will make him dislike me  so i hid all of my feelings from him  even the good ones. afraid that if i showed that i liked him too much he would stop liking me back.   he began to become more distant and cold as time went on throughout our relationship. he stopped touching me as much to the point where we stopped having sex altogether  he started talking to me a lot harsher  and would snap at me over the smallest things. i felt like i had to walk on eggshells around him just so he wouldn t yell at me about making a mess  or forgetting to do something. he would call me stupid a lot to the point where i started to actually believe him. all of this hurt me but i would rather be with him and be hurt than be alone without him so i decided to push through it and let it happen. i told him over text last week that i just wanted to be able to talk to him more because we have never opened up to each other before  he invited me over to  talk  but he just ended up getting drunk instead so he wouldn t have to deal with confronting me.  the night he broke up with me he asked me if i ever thought that maybe we should just be friends instead of lovers  he confessed to me that he has been dealing with thoughts of suicide as well and was thinking about overdosing on his insulin since he s diabetic. i believe he s currently going through his quarter life crisis since his birthday is in january and he will be turning 25 at the end of that month and has extreme depression and anxiety centering around his birthday and getting older in general. he tells me he feels like a loser living with his parents still and that he should be further where he is in life even though i ve told him more than half of young adults live with their parents now since covid hit  but these statistics don t make him feel any better about his current position.   he told me that he s not able to take care of me and give me what i need out of a relationship because he can t even take care of himself right now due to this weight on his shoulders of feeling pressured to survive as an adult in society. he explained that he was only treating me so nasty because that s how he feels about himself internally  which killed me because i was starting to think it was just his personality. i knew he was depressed  but not the point where he wants to kill himself like i do. i have extreme fears of abandonment and was having a nervous break down over him leaving me but he said he wasn t going anywhere and that he would never abandon me  he said we can still be best friends and see each other like we normally do  but i have no idea how to feel about all of it.   he works sunday wednesday every week so we have always seen each other on thursdays saturdays and he said that wasn t going to change. i was already withholding my affection for him months before the breakup  but now i feel like i m gonna have to be working over time to hide my romantic and sexual feelings for him even more now. he spent the night at my house and slept in my bed with me 2 nights in a row after he broke up with me  the 3rd night after that  last night  i spent the night as his house even though i have insomnia and his bed is extremely uncomfortable and i knew i wasn t going to be able to sleep  but i still spent the whole night with him because i m so attached to him and am having a hard time processing the break up. basically everything is the same as before we broke up  just no kissing  hand holding  casual cuddling  and obviously no sex.   one of my female best friends told me i should be spending time apart from him but i can t help but feel like his work days count as that time for us being apart  i always want to be with him but i m scared the more i m with him the harder its gonna be for me to stop these feelings that i have for him. i am so worried about him hurting himself i just want to be there for him  whether that s as a friend or as a lover  it doesn t matter  whatever it takes to make him happy and get him in a better mental state.   i currently attend therapy once a week on mondays  i do plan on talking about this to my therapist asap and have a psychiatrist appointment set for the beginning of next month to start looking into medication options since i was too nervous to go last time and skipped my last appointment on purpose. in the meantime  what can i do to help him  what can i do to help better myself  how do i stop wanting to get better for him rather than for myself  any advice would be greatly appreciated   tldr  boyfriend

83401,i m a sophomore with diagnosed major depression and anxiety  because of my diagnosis my school has to treat me like i m special ed to some degree. the school i ve been going to has made some of my worst life memories just in freshman year. in about a quarter and a half of my first semester i have a failing grade in 2 of my classes and because of my treatment from the school they have to come up with some sort of plan to help me fix those grades  that includes my extreme mother. when she heard the news every day since then she s been yelling at me about schoolwork and whenever she catches me on my phone in bed or talking to my friends she gets on me about it in a condescending way  last night i was playing something with my friends for like the first time in 2 weeks and she caught me and then took it away immediately after. she wants me to complete every single assignment i ve missed and i want her to know how unrealistic that is for me but she won t listen to me and will proceed to scream at me. i ve just been put in a really bad place because of all this and i feel like i m stuck in a hole and it s my fault and i should be ashamed of myself and should be punished with no remorse. i don t know what to do anymore and i hope i don t sound like a stereotypical teen angry about his mom taking his electronics away. i m just sick of being punished and yelled at every day because of my lack of desire to do anything in life,2020-11-24 03:53:37
11721,if you aren t a sports fan but still want to consistently participate in conversation  it may become difficult when sports come up.   so when the conversation will eventually switch to sports  unless you want to stand there awkwardly and wait for a topic switch  a simple input of a score or a cool play you watched will make the situation less awkward.   if you re looking to make friends in a new environment  bouncing around conversation when the topic changes will make you forgettable  and won t cement your place in the friend group.,2022-01-14 09:56:04
2555,lpt  read up on session topics  from the course plan and list of prescribed reading material  before the sessions and come prepared with a set of questions for the faculty.    more often than not  faculty are sounding boards to get your ideas discussed  questions answered and doubts clarified.  this boosts discussion where other students can pitch in with their varied views and expertise  leading to an overall better learning experience.  this works wonders in many mba and such masters level classes  where people from varied background and experience attend classes and contribute from their experience across domains and industries.  this helps gain a practical understanding of how concepts  tools and techniques work in the reality and helps integrate several learnt concepts.  that way students can make best use of their faculty  the fee they pay and come out a lot wiser than they enter the course.,2021-05-11 02:36:31

2444,it doesn t cost that much more to maintain an extra cat and the camaraderie between two cats that are  ideally  littermates is amazing. you ll enjoy them so much more since they ll likely have different personalities from each other and they entertain each other so they tend to be happier in general.   i ve owned single cats and while they were amazing and still lived a perfectly happy life  having two cats completely changed my perspective. they re just so much more fun to watch when they re playing with each other and you ve always got at least one by your side when the other is off doing it s own cat stuff throughout the day. they also are never lonely whenever i have to leave town so i always feel better in that regard. i splurged on an automatic litter box and feeder so taking care of them is extremely simple.,2021-05-08 09:43:51

4658,i have a question about mindfulness and meditation. i have recently begun using sam harris  waking up app  and he instructs you to be cognizant and aware when stressful or anxious thoughts come into your mind  but to recognize them and realize them for what they are  which the majority of the time is something internal that really isn t a problem at all. my question then is what about when the stress is warranted  like losing a loved one  getting fired  or something else that is substantial and the stress is not a product on something internal. how is this reconciled with mindfulness ,2021-10-11 07:07:57

109938,has anyone ever thought like   okay if i can accomplish x  i think my depression will subside     for me it was success as i became an adult. i used to drink and do a significant amount of drugs when i was in my later teenage years.  now 23 . i always figured if i got a good job and became at least semi successful my depression would subside.   after years of separating myself from my friend group and getting a better job and getting sober   i was never heavily addicted to any substances  just abused them often.  i have never felt more alone and depressed in my entire life. when i was 17 18 in my senior year of high school i thought i was incredibly depressed and it couldn t possibly get worse than that. but it did.   at least back then i was surrounded by all of my friends and we were having a good time on the surface. now i have no friends. i am all alone. i don t have any meaningful relationships. life has never better shittier for me and i always thought that buying a new car  getting a better job  becoming more financially stable would help rid me of my depression. it hasn t. in fact it s worse than it ever has been. has anyone else made any attempts like this to rid themselves of depression yet only found themselves further in the pit of it ,2021-02-14 23:22:44

2871,hello fellow mediators     for much of my life  i d say that despite life s ups and downs  i ve been lucky enough to have a mental state of underlying happiness. or  at least  reasonably happy. i experienced some pretty deep existential anxiety and dread several years back  which got me into meditation to help me slowly climb out of it.    despite the intense feelings improving  i ve noticed a sort of underlying feeling of sadness... just a dark and almost hopeless feeling that blankets everything. i m wondering if anyone has any meditation techniques or guided sessions to address this. i suppose i m not necessarily looking to be super happy all the time  just not to allow those dark thoughts to penetrate seemingly everything.    thank you for any suggestions.,2021-06-30 05:24:45

 the commands     after you ve sent a message to  u frik4nd3lbr00dj3  b0t  https   www.reddit.com user frik4nd3lbr00dj3 b0t  and gotten a response  you can send more commands to the bot as a reply to

link to has to be placed after    link  .     unlink    removes  link.     question    gives you a question from the list. if no number is provided a random number will be drawn. the bot sends the question to both people when linked.     help    tries to help you.     feedback   can be used to leave feedback. please write your feedback after    feedback  .     changelog    displays the changes made to this bot.   amp  x200b   if you and a friend want to get random questions from the bot it s easier if both receive this question at the same time  so you won t have to repeat the question. so for example  you can both take turns and request questions and the bot will send the question to both of you every time. to achieve this  there has to be a link. this link can be achieved with the    link   command. you and your friend both have to use this command to be linked together so the bot knows to whom it has to reply. it s very easy. just reply    link   followed by the name of the person you want to link to. for example if you want to link to your friend username123     link username123    amp  x200b   you can request a random question by replying with    question  . you could also add a number to the    question   command to pick a question based on its number  if you have a lucky number for example . if you don t provide a number  a random number will be drawn. the bot will also ensure you won t pick the same question twice  it keeps track . if you re liked  you and you friend will both receive the same question and the bot will keep track of the numbers for both of you. an example     question   or if you want to get a question based on its number     question 123    amp  x200b   the    unlink   command will hopefully not be necessary  but it s good to know that it exists. like its name suggests  it removes the link between you and your friend. you should only use this when you don t want to receive any more replies from this bot regarding your friend. it will only    unlink   for this particular friend. if you also have links with other friends  they ll will still remain. an example     unlink    amp  x200b   the    help   command is pretty self explanatory i guess  it displays all the commands and well  tries to help you with that. an example     help    amp  x200b   the    feedback   enables you to leave feedback. if you have any tips or just want to help  feel free to use this command. you have to write the feedback after    feedback.   if you for example want to let me know that i should add some more features     feedback please add some more features.    amp  x200b   the    changelog   command is probably not all that interesting for most people. an example     changelog    amp  x200b   if you have any questions don t hesitate to ask them     have fun     ,2021-05-02 15:24:53
4015,we are often shown that the world we perceive is indeed a river flowing by us. we are asked to witness our breath or the wall in front of us or the taste of a raisin. to put our awareness on it.   has anyone tried to witness themselves falling asleep   i tried this last night and it kept me up all night and was extremely exhausting. cool thought exercise though.,2021-09-01 18:05:01

73439, you ve been my my best friend since 2011. when i met you  i believed you were the coolest person. as the years went by  our friendship blossomed. we went everywhere together  carry the same interests  always had a fun time no matter what we did. we both love to draw  creating our own worlds and stories. character creation and design. not only do we carry the same physique  our mannerisms and senses of humor are extremely alike. we are the same  yet very different. the obvious differences i started to become hyper aware off after sophomore year.   you ve always been much prettier and more memorable than i have. the countless amount of times boys approached you back then  showering you and your art with compliments. they would come to me only for the possibility to find out more details about you. of course  i just continued to brush it all off.   you had always been the better artist than i. even if we were of the same par  your style captured the heart of most eyes. constantly showered in praises  your talent even managed to amaze me. i would put my art out there  but never gained as much attention. everyone remembers you and your art. i just dwelled under your shadow. of course  i just continued to brush it all off.   your friend circle expands significantly. you were suddenly befriended with many  many people. you acknowledge them as best friends  dear friends  and people you knowingly trust  love and hold close. even though you and i are inseparable  you never properly introduced me to them. you said to me that  my friends are your friends.  though  it didn t feel as so. when you were absent  oftentimes i ate lunch alone. the preference for you was always there. i knew i wasn t you. but of course  i just continued to brush it all off.   within this time  your birthday rolls around. i am sure to get you a meaningful gift. my birthday strings by a month later  only to be forgotten. you apologize upon being reminded. i was upset  but i did not let it show. i brushed it off.   junior year rolls around  and i have made a new friend. she carries the same interests as you and i. sweet as can be  i knew you would love to meet her. introduce you to her  things hit off immediately. she meshed with us perfectly. we were a trio of very like minded friends. who could ve predicted that this was to bite my ass at the end    fast forward to after graduation. we are attending college together. there s only one major difference you are married. with who used to be a co worker  is now your faithful husband. in the same year  you move in with one another. this is when your style began to fully flourish. this is when you started to realize you did not need the schooling to be successful  as for your art had already gained a ridiculous amount of traction. you drop out of college  leaving us. somewhat torn  we understand your reasonings and continue to brush it off.   eventually  you begin to grow envious of us. she and i saw each other often  while you didn t. you began to guilt trip  and it works. she and i plan weekly visitations to your new apartment. eventually this becomes harder to as life begins to hand me tons of lemons. i began to not see you as much  while she continued to.   fast forwarding  you two become inseparable. you ve created a countless amount of worlds and stories with one another. you and her both  create and flourish a comic together. you and her get praise and patrons for your work. you both go and get your first tattoos with eachother. i am left out. there is apparently too much detail you and her have created  that makes it too late for me to get involved in. i have missed so much. i try to brush it off.   eventually  you and her make new friends. friends i have not a clue about. it hurts  but i do not say anything. instead  i began to take initiative and spark my own circle of friends in secret. it works  but also backfires. you have gained so much attention on social media  that everyone i meet seems to already know you. either that  or if i befriend someone you don t know  you will reel them in. they realize you are much better than me. i am left in the dust. i can t brush it off.   up to date. you and i are 23 years old. i had just left your place last night after a few months without seeing you or her. you show me all your accomplishments  wealth  art  and what you and her have been developing for so long. while you are living with your husband in a nicely sized home  i am still living with my parents. while you are showering your man with wanted gifts of appreciation  i can hardly afford to buy my boyfriend of three years anything off of his mounting wishlist. i m still trying to gain money for a drawing screen  while you are ordering your next graphic device. your bank account is stacked  while mine is pulling records in the negatives. your life seems to be paving a great outlook built on success and fortune  while mine is still a haze.   i m depressed  discouraged  disconnected. i m going no where in life. perhaps i m bitter and selfish  because it hurts to see you do so well when we started in the same place. maybe we were never that much alike  after all.    if you read this  bless your soul and i deeply apologize for any confusion. i m running on no sleep  and i m pretty out of it. i intended on crying until i just passed out  but decided to type my feelings for once.,2020-10-20 09:57:50

58987,if you do take the time to read this i hope your doing okay.  to start off id like to say i dont think i m depressed or have depression  i just want to put my thoughts into text to see if it ll help just a bit.  these past couple days have been very hard mentally.  very simple really. afraid of losing people i care about  not having a future  being a failure  self doubt  ect.  ive been so  in my head you could say thinking non stop about how things will end and how i will lose the people i love.  i feel like my mom especially feels like i dont love her. i do with all my heart but i feel like i dont show it enough  i can fix that though. i hope  getting out of bed is a struggle  being productive is almost impossible at this time  i lost one of my best friends recently  they called me toxic and left they re not wrong in calling me that   they were the first person i could tell everything too made me feel cared for but in the end its fine  they made the right choice   have a great day thanks for listening    sam,2020-08-24 13:55:26
137486,i m just tired  i grew up on the street with crazy horrible controlling lazy parents which i was able to push past. i got married  a job a house and for a while life was great but it all fell apart and now i m almost completely alone again  no house  no wife everything is gone but the dog who i do love. i pulled myself i m back up got my own place again and a good job but i can t see the point anymore. since the divorce last year i ve had my heard destroyed twice  it feels like no matter how hard i work or how hard i try it never matters  i always end up alone and tired. there is obviously more i just wanted to vent. i just can t deal with this life much longer. the constant pain  loss  disaster and aloneness is getting to be too much.,2021-06-04 15:20:49
2442,good evening brothers and sisters  for the first time in my meditation journey  i felt something really absurd to describe  after realising how happy my life is  i started to feel a really intense tickle all over my body  and it grew at every inhale  it didn t last long  but i never felt such an overwhelming sense of happiness  almost as on orgasm  but on other plane. have you ever had something similar ,2021-06-07 09:09:33
104990,i find myself becoming more and more fed up with life. i constantly have the urge to scream and or cry. i m losing my grip. my job has become annoying to me. i m beginning to hate everything about it  mostly based on how i m being treated. i don t know what else to do  though  because i can t seem to find a good fit for me.   i ve said this before  i don t want to kill myself  but i m finding that i m becoming tired of living. i don t always feel this way  but it does happen from time to time. i m too afraid to tell my therapist about it. but i m afraid that she ll send me to inpatient care  and i literally can t afford that. no one else can pay my bills for me  or feed my cat. and i just know that my family would make it about themselves  pretending to care  asking for sympathy  etc.   that s the other thing. i ve had a lot of repressed  fucked up memories coming to light lately  and they knew about all of it and did nothing about it. i m disgusted with them. i have been for awhile  for other reasons  but this is just another nail in the coffin.   i m so tempted to drop everything and live in the fucking woods. just me and my cat. no one to fucking bother me.,2021-01-26 08:26:07

40204,my fianc  of 7 years has covid  and he s unlikely to survive. i was depressed before this  but. if he dies i m going with him. he s my lifeline.   but this is so selfish. my mom just spent 2k on me for new classes. i can t just waste her money. and who will feed my cats  they re too old to be adopted from the shelter.   luckily i have no friends that will miss me  and no job that i have obligations for.   i don t know what to do. i don t want to make my cats miserable because they love me. but i don t want to wait that long  either. but i m all talking as if my fianc  will even die in the first place.   i don t know. i m just venting.,2020-06-17 05:41:05
139321,ever since middle school i ve been convincing myself that i d be someone who ll work as a music producer composer. fast forward 8 years later  little did i know i was doing jack shit compared to other music pursuers who actually had a real passion for the art.  in the beginning  i felt i was like every other person starting out. made some tracks but sounded nothing like the music i listen to  but that was justifiable. recently though i ve been feeling more than unmotivated  realizing just how much i ve failed to actually internalize myself with music. instead of picking up an instrument to hone my skills  i neglect the entire idea. instead of enjoying and studying other music artists  i ve begun to envy the talent and success of my favorites. instead of staying on a consistent schedule trying to practice my composing and theory and coming up with new ideas  i resort to burning my time away watching youtube videos and playing the meek selection of video games available to me.   at this point i know music is not for me  and that it will never be more than a hobby for me  but even now i always feel shackled by this obligation to keep going and this mentality that  you ve already committed to it for so long now  why the fuck are you backing out now  i feel this need to create  only to turn on my daw and stare at it for a few minutes before shutting down my computer and continuing this disgusting cycle of depressing laziness constantly thinking that everything i m doing that isn t bettering my music skills is wasted time. looking back at all the tracks i ve made  i m almost fully convinced that i will never make any more music that sounds better than that.  fucking dammit  if only i knew i was lying to myself sooner,2021-06-10 22:15:47
158604,i feel that i need to be useful  and i m isolating myself in this moment from friends and all  and i m going a little crazy today i woke up crying  and i m like  wow i can start studying now  then i start crying because i m a worthless thing  and i miss my friends but i don t want to show them this unsightful thing  and start crying  and they don t need me that is true i know but i don t feel that i belong somewhere if i don t feel useful  and now i m here trembling and started to drink because it clears my head and keeps me calm  i m going from a spur of will to do something to the next second crying because i m worthless and in the back of my head its the thought of if i kill myself i ll be free  and that voice is right. i m sorry and thank you.,2021-08-18 17:48:46
4502,lie down . draw a small never ending circle in the air  like you re doing the crazy gesture  in front of you. close your eyes. keep doing the circle gesture  but pay attention to it with your eyes closed.  i don t know why but this is so satisfying. i can literally feel my legs and abdomen becoming warmer.,2021-09-30 20:09:36
81425,have had depression for 10 years. i suffer from sylvia plath syndrome  which basically means a depressed creative person  a writer  an artist  etc. i have written a lot of poems and i am slowly starting to get a little famous  but i hate it. i can t function properly and that s why i can t be a person others can look up to.   depression is not the only mental illness i have and all the faults together make my life a living hell. it has become worse with every year. i feel i am not human anymore.  there s nothing in my life awaiting me.,2020-11-18 08:50:41
180202,i ve had the worst months  years  life  etc. or at least that s what it feels like right now. i graduated my trade high school during covid where i never got to finish my major projects and i feel like that period of my life was taken from me. my whole childhood  really. i ve been working since i was 15 but i had side gigs for cash before that. held the same job until i was 18  then switched to a m j er warehouse and the job was pretty chill some days terrible others with decent ish wages. a few months ago they fired me essentially because i took time off after my great aunt died and i had a surgery consultation a few states away which i put in a request off form for. they lost the request off form and terminated me while i was gone and to cover their asses  said it was due to attendance. my attendance wasn t great  but nobody s was and i m trying really hard with my depression and since high school i ve been taking college classes that i barely have time for but im getting a s and b s so.   yay even though i feel like an imposter who will never have an actual career.  today i work at a different warehouse  pays more and less labor but im still pissed  and im behind in a typography class and everything feels so heavy. i have to save  10 000 by march for my surgery. i m so mad at getting fired and my mental illness and my body and the world and money. i m just so angry all of the time. i have to be at work for a 12 hour shift in a few hours but i can t sleep because i m holding such a large weight i can barely breathe. i never have these pity parties for myself but this depressive episode demanded it. i feel so busy and tired i can t recall consistently taking my meds this week. everything sucks but i ll be okay right ,2021-11-03 23:45:31
12369,if i had a nickle for every single person who tells me they can understand my pain and what i am going through i would be a billionaire. you have no idea of the pain within my mind. you have no idea of the hell that rages inside me. do not speak to me of pain until you are holding a pistol to the side of your head looking for every excuse not to pull the trigger. do not speak to me of pain until you are waist deep in below freezing water hoping against hope that you will fall unconsciously asleep as your body temperature drops and you hope to never wake up. do not speak to me of pain until your faith is utterly destroyed because you pray to a god who refuses to listen and revels in your struggle. do not speak to me of pain until you are told you will not live to see 35 unless things get better for you and you all can do is smile at the very thought of death. do not speak to me of pain until you go to bed every single night hoping  begging that you will not wake to see the sun rise and face yet another day of hellish nightmare. do not speak to me of pain until you have no one to call a friend or family and you have no hope of ever finding someone to love you. until you experience one or all of these  you do not know pain  and i pray to whatever god exists if any that you never do. because when you know my pain  you are already dead.,2020-03-09 19:27:35
53035,a little background on me. introvert  don t have many friends  always felt like a cast out  so i tried killing myself at 17  real  not for attention .  went to university where the only thing i was proud of  my knowledge and mental capacity  was seriously put to the test and i failed miserably. started thinking there was no point in trying or doing anything because i would eventually kill myself. years passed and all i had was depression  because i never tried hard enough at anything.  was always moving around because of the job i had  but eventually ended up in a city where i knew nobody. no social life  can t make friends  etc.  four years ago i was feeling strong urges to kill myself almost daily. one day i almost did it  but instead called a friend for help and thanks to her went to therapy. i ve been with a psychologist and a psychiatrist ever since. i m medicated and i ve been stable.  i ve been an uncle recently and that brought be joy  but after a while i start to feel that void  the family i ve always wanted  the kids  the solitude  even started feeling bad around the baby because i feel i wouldn t be a good dad.  lately i ve been feeling suicidal again. i m 36 now so everybody has family or whatever  making friends is harder because of reduced social life. pandemic isolation happens. can t get an appointment with either of my therapists since february. installed tinder to try and meet somebody  felt worst after the experience.  today i was on my limit again. i reached out to my ex  we broke up around christmas but we kept in touch  to talk over the phone  she invited me to her place for a chat and a hug. after a while she tells me this will be the last time we will meet because she has a new boyfriend and it wouldn t be fair to keep me around. i understood and actually felt good for her  she looked happy  but now i lost another person that was helping me keeping my head above the water...  i don t want to kill myself  but that s all i can think of because my life is empty and every way. almost no friends  none around   hate my career path  have no family... i can t think of a single good thing about myself.  what should i do  where do i start  please  please  help me....,2020-08-01 22:03:10
123403,it makes me sad to know that even before the pandemic started  i was always isolating myself and withholding from others and distancing myself from everyone and so forth. only difference this pandemic brought to me was that everyone had to live like i have within these past few years. i dont know why i even feel  but i fear that even after the pandemic comes to an end  i will still be living like we are still in one. alone  in my room  and so on.,2021-04-18 15:41:26

5132,i was wondering if anyone else experienced this. i am a beginner so i m curious if this is normal or there is something i might be doing wrong.   so the thing is  when i get deep  i lose the perception of my hands and forearms. i don t know if they are touching anymore or not. i no longer know which is left or which is right and don t know anymore where they are place around my body. almost as if they were numb. the moment i decide to move them they come back immediately to where they are and i can again feel their placement.   i was wondering if it is also possible to work it up into having that sensation for the rest of the body  almost like floating.  experiences    ,2021-11-09 06:04:19

3153,delivery drivers are able to pick and choose which orders to accept and which to ignore. if you don t offer a high enough tip  you may get ignored by multiple drivers  resulting in an increased wait for your food. if you offer  1 mile  it is almost guaranteed that the first driver to see your order will take it.  however  in some cases  even this may not be enough. if the delivery is very far away  the driver may still reject it because such a delivery might take them outside of their delivery zone  so they wouldn t be able to accept any more orders for a while after delivering your food  which would cost them potential money.,2021-05-26 22:08:17
147906,i know we constantly hear about how suicide is a cowardly act and i get why it looks that way. it seems like an easy way to escape life s problems. but i don t think it s easy.   i am utterly terrified of death and yet i m so tired of being me. not a day goes by without me wishing that i was braver. not so i could face the next day but so i could just stop it. facing the next day requires me to do nothing. i just need to get up in the morning and watch stuff somehow get worse every day. actually ending it takes more courage than i have.   i know it s probably not a healthy or helpful view but i don t think suicide is a cowardly act. at worst  it s an act of desperation.,2021-07-12 01:17:39

2421,i see this often in my work  someone holds their hands up and says  i m disgusting  but the other person presses the point and says they don t care.  you don t know why someone is dirty  they might have feces on their hands  or maybe they just don t like touching others.  accept their claim they re dirty or gross and back off without making it awkward.,2021-05-07 17:19:51
186472,i f15  don t want to go on antidepressants and i don t know if it s the right choice or not. currently i am medicated on quetiapine for hallucinations and mood swings  vyvanse for adhd and topiramate for neuralgia.   i have been on quetiapine since i was about 10  but before that i was on some anti depressant that had a reverse effect and put me in a hyper state that upped my self harm  suicidal thoughts and hallucinations among other things. although mentally i am not in the best last right now  i worry if i go on a anti depressant again i will have the same reaction  but my mom insists trying. since being in that  hyper state  i have been unable to sleep without sleeping pills as a side effect  they just upped my dose of q to the morning as well which i don t really agree with since it makes me drowsy at school but i m hoping if i do this i can use this in my argument to stay off pills.   i was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia back in august and since than have been on various seizure medications to treat it. all of them have seriously affected my memory and speech leaving me in a dazed state. any possible side effects of medications that may possibly make me affect the rest of this memory and my ability to function  or make me drowsy i cannot physically afford. i would lose my ability to do school  work  possibly make me sicker than i am  and god knows what else  i know for some people medications are needed but to me it s not something i want in my life. i know my depression forms from my ptsd and me being sick  and i feel like if my doctors give me more resources to deal with that instead of trying to put me on more medication  i would be able to work on it  if i wouldn t feel better after that than i would consider medication. i am not currently in therapy and i m waiting for more invasive treatment on my neuralgia  but have no help managing pain  my pills don t help much. my mom wants me medicated as well  and because i m too young to make medical decisions it s really her choice but i am not wanting to at all.  what are your guys thoughts ,2021-11-25 20:53:01
29897,im sick and tired of everyone and everything. i feel worthless and overthink every thing even the smallest stuff. i always have negative thoughts. i have been losing interest in the things i enjoyed. i have thought about suicide multiple times to the point where i just cry alone for a while. i have been having these problems these last 4 and a half years but this last 2 years have been the hardest for me. i know no one will truly understand me because at the end of day i hide my feelings and thoughts in my head where i know no one can judge or hurt me.,2020-05-12 01:40:55
144603,lately i feel uneasy with my friendship with my best friend. my dude is like a genuine brother to me and we ve been friends for years now but lately it seems like he doesn t care about me and we aren t as close as before.   as of this year we ve hung out and had trips and that seems like the only thing going well but i want someone i consider my brother to be there for me like i was there for them. it seems like lately he s only here for the good parts.   for example i recently got dumped by ex and she was kinda friends with everyone in my group and i was in pain  when i told him he seemed nonchalant at best and it felt like he really didn t care about how i felt at the time and was more worried about the net work because she seemed to tutor him i don t know it just felt disloyal to me because when he broke up with his ex i had been there with him and even got in contact with his ex to make sure the dude and him had proper closure rather than the break up over the phone part he was attempting. it just rubbed me the wrong way that he didn t seem to care how i felt but rather his needs. maybe i m the selfish one but none of my other friends reacted like that.   i love him a lot but he just doesn t even seem to act like my brother. when we used to talk we clicked now days it s so awkward and i can barely get a decent convo with the guy without him squeezing in his own stuff all the time.   it feels like i m being too clingy or a peak to his brand new life and idk how to feel and i don t want to ask my other friends because i don t want them to feel experience awkwardness.   so should i just be the bigger man and wait as time passes by to see what to do or what ,2021-06-30 00:42:15
38435,i used to have a variety of dream spirits  even though i suck but i still do my best in everything.    but as time passed by  my little fantasy world started to fall apart....... ever since my parents keep and won t stop humiliating me in front of my cousins and friends. they seem so proud every time talking about all my weakness and how idiot is i to everyone they like. i still remember that time i did a small mistake and accidentally upset my aunt  so she scolded me so loud in front of my parents. i got scared and embarrassing  so i cried ... the hot tears falling down from my eye to cheek  my head was looking down. my parents didn t say anything  but throw me a shit looking like i mean nothing to them no matter what i do. everything is my fault  whatever is it they just don t care  just me  i m the causes of all the shit things.  every time i tried to forgive them  because well every parent is shit  no one is perfect. but deep inside me was hurt so much. i didn t get any benefit in forgiving them  but if i don t  my life couldn t move on. but the point is  why is it so unfair. who s gonna heal me  no one   every time i get into shit problems  i just keep quiet and share with no one. because no one will understand  they tell me to think positively  try some new hobby........ i tried everything  it s already not the first time  it s like infinite  my heart had broken into infinite broken pieces   i forgive and forgive again  but shit still comes and comes again.  i feel like i m drowning into a very deep ocean. sometimes i found peace within  sometimes i feel extremely suffocating. there were only empty  loneliness  fear  and darkness. i m lost.   eventually  i made my own thinking    there are many victims from disaster  some survive some dead. if i get to choose  what would i be  a survivor of disaster or a survivor of this pathetic world so i can escape from my darkness and turn into dust  ,2020-06-11 05:26:49
43090,i m sorry. you don t have to read this  i just need to put my thoughts out there. i try to do that with my friends but i just end up hurting them or disappointing them. i m probably going to start hiding things from them.   i feel like i can t do this anymore. i m 15f  diagnosed with anxiety and depression and i m taking bupropion and fluoxetine and i have a therapist. but things aren t getting better. every time i think it s starting to work  i just get shot back down to rock bottom and i m so sick of it. i constantly feel empty  and that may sound like it s better than feeling sad  but i promise you it s not. it makes me feel like i m not alive  which makes me resort to feeding into an addiction i have that makes me feel better.   along with the emptiness  something else is wrong with me. i see things and feel things and smell things and hear things  but i don t think they re real. when i m talking to my friends i feel like i m actually just in an empty room talking to myself. when i m sitting in my room i feel like i m hallucinating everything around me. i hear voices sometimes  some of them i recognize and some of them i don t. i see things that i know aren t real. i m going insane.   i spend most of my days sleeping 15  hours. i can t be bothered to get out of bed and eat something or go to the bathroom or anything. i just lay there  occasionally on my phone  usually listening to music  but mostly sleeping. i think i m addicted to sleep  too. i m constantly tired  craving it  and i sleep to avoid stress and responsibilities.   there aren t many things keeping me alive anymore. i ve been like this for 6 years and i don t see any light at the end of my tunnel. people say it gets better but honestly  i don t think it does. i ll be like this the rest of my life. i feel like death is better. but i don t even want to die  i just cannot love much longer because it s too painful. i used to think that i d make everyone s lives easier if i was dead  but now i know that s not true. i d make my family  my friends  and my dog devastated. i know that i m loved  but it s starting to not be enough. i m afraid of myself. i don t know what to do.,2020-06-27 00:52:42
2118,hey everyone  hope y all are having a great day night.   i grew up in a pretty rocky family  and i don t really feel anything anymore except anxiety and sudden spurts of depression. i can easily make new friends  both locally and globally  but i can t seem to keep connected to them. it seems to fizzle away and i have trouble maintaining relationships.   i m an introvert so talking to people is difficult for me after a certain point. my social tank runs out real fast.   is there anyone who d be interested in befriending me  knowing full well that i need to learn a lot about human emotions and friendship   .   ps  i swear i m not such a downer.... at least not externally  . i love video games  anime  dark humour  shows like it s always sunny  football  drinking etc etc  ,2021-05-11 00:44:07

4185,so basically when you go to settings  gt sounds   at the top you ll see   reduce loud noises   option   tap on that and enable it if you haven t   after doing so you ll see a scroll bar which you can set to specific decibel levels  to block out very loud noises   for example after my earphones  broke   they produced a very inflated and unusually  loud sound   after i set the decibel level at 90   the sound became much better and i was able to listen to music  without ear damage   not recommended to listen to music at full volume  ,2021-06-24 14:11:08

2864, when someone goes out of their way to help you  spontaneously or by request  and they don t have to  e.g.  like a coworker asked to do something unusual   see that person for the asset they are. when you have a chance to pay them back  with information that might help them  or by talking them up to others  you create more of the behaviour through positive reinforcement.  if someone won t walk ten feet to save you a walk of ten miles  recognize that person for the obstinate  destructive burden they are. consider whether to forward any information you could optionally give to help them. it may be for the greater good to withhold helpful information  so their career will be more  unlucky  and they will be less likely to advance into positions of greater responsibility where they might spread their disservice ethos to subordinates.,2021-05-19 11:41:07
11680,the number one reason people give up so fast is because they tend to look at how far they still have to go instead of how far they have come. but it s a series of small wins that can give us the most significant success.,2022-01-13 05:19:58
11915,in this day and age  privacy is something we lose a little more of each day. most don t bat an eye at freely giving up things like their birthday  phone number  email address  etc. when signing up for something online  but you d be surprised at how useful that often that information is sold and how useful it is for someone with bad intent. names  addresses  birthdays are all things used to verify your identify  reset passwords  and more.   by googling yourself every so often  you can find the websites that have created  profiles  for you which often include an impressive amount of accurate information. from full names  to phone numbers  addresses  political party affiliation  email addresses  social media sites  and more.   most of these websites have simple to use opt out tools that you can find by scrolling to the bottom of the page and looking for. sometimes it s under their privacy policy page  sometimes there s a link plainly labeled  opt out.   to opt out  most websites request your name  an email address  and the link to your profile on their website. after a couple days to a week  your information should be removed from the website  if not removed instantly.   most of the information these sites collect is all public record. but just because it s public record doesn t mean it should be readily available in seconds to anyone searching your name.,2022-01-19 20:06:16

10716,i lent  800 to one of my best friends while she was unemployed. she was long distance dating this guy and wanted to go and see him and asked me to foot the bill  which i now deeply regret . she knew i had a decent sized savings at the time and said she would repay me once she got her unemployment money in two weeks. well  it turns out they cut off her unemployment. this was in september of last year.   she just got a new job in december and while i m not expecting her to be able to repay me the  800 immediately  my issue is that she hasn t even brought it up. we speak often  almost every day and in none of those conversations has she said   hey  i know i said i was gonna repay you in two weeks but obviously that didn t work out. now that i am working  i ll try to re pay you whenever.  nothing at all has been said which i think is screwed up.   when would be an appropriate time to ask her when she plans to repay me my money  my savings has gone way down and  800 is a lot of money right now.   she also just got a ebt card and told me i could put on  150 in groceries. i was contemplating doing that every month until it reached  800 but i don t know if i can continue to be friends with her if she never brings up this money that she borrowed from me.,2022-01-13 11:00:00
56870,i have no friends. i have no job. i have no future. i m an autistic piece of shit whose only skill is disappointing people. my only comfort is wallowing in self pity and self hatred. i can t take it anymore.  they say  it gets better . well  if things don t get better by the end of 2020  i m going to kill myself.,2020-08-16 14:41:13
34150,it felt like the first time i ve actually had my shit together right before covid hit. i was settling into my dream job  we just got approved for a wicked rental  heaps of space  affordable  just me and husband on our own   husband just got a new job and was loving it.  then covid hit  husband lost his job  and his car broke down  and parts are no longer available due to a certain company shutting up shop.. i worked throughout the entire  shutdown  as i m apparently an essential worker  retail management . i did not take a single day off.  a few weeks ago i got the worst news possible. the higher ups decided to move me to another store  i didn t have a choice. it was move to this other store or get a redundancy payout. the first store  dream job  isn t making the profits they hoped for  despite the virus being literally the best thing for this company profits wise  so they wanted to cut costs even more by moving me. i ve been at the new store less than 2 weeks and i ve taken 3 days off due to anxiety and generally being a sad sack of shit. i haven t felt like this for so long  and i can t remember the last time i legitimately thought about ending it all  and not just a passing thought  actually thinking about it and small details pertaining to it  how i would go about it and when  etc  i can barely sleep or eat  i am exhausted and so disappointed in myself  i want to be happy again  but i can t see how i can get there.  i feel like this forced job change has undone years of hard work i ve done for my mental health just like that.  no one in the company is sympathetic or understanding because  they ve been working the whole time too  and don t think i have a reason to be upset. maybe i don t  maybe i m just a whiny piece of shit. maybe i never even had my shit together in the first place,2020-05-26 13:11:19
169431,bear with me this will be long  hello  to start this off im not using a throwaway as i should because a part of me hopes somebody randomly knows my account and helps me. but to begin with  i had a great childhood athough i went to many depressive periods in life and have self harmed due to bullying and household abuse.  as i grew older this depression or i dont know what to call it as my body just feels like theres a limiter placed on me  as the were theres a shadow always peering over me  gotten worse to the point where i never went to school  couldnt shower or take care of myself. i thought my depression got better as i never was sad anymore in my 18 19 years of age but looking back that saddness just turned to anger. i don t understand why i kept feeling this way  my life is great  i got a better relationship with my friends  family  and my girlfriend.   but towards the start of this year a little after my 20th birthday the anger went back to sadness. it was small at first just random sad gloomy feelings then occasionally depressive episodes once a couple of months til a few months ago it got exponentially worse. i started sleeping almost 24 7 and ultimately stopped showering and pretty much never eat now. i felt horrible but i never told anyone.   around that time my friends and i discovered acid or lsd and decided to try it. i unfortunately loved it a lot  i felt happy i felt genuinely happy while high and that s something ive never felt before. i started tripping every week after that constantly increasing my dosage to the point where yesterdays trip i was at 700umg. this drug got me to start taking other stuff. i started smoking wax but only when im high on lsd. i started getting feels about taking molly and percocet and xanax as i saw some guy on snapchat selling them. i ended up buy a lot from him but i havent taken it yet  its been sitting in my dresser drawer but i know if i trip again ill most likely take them just to feel happy. and as for when im not tripping i have been constantly drinking  it didnt help that the concert i went to the other day registered me as 21 even though im 20 so i ended up drink a lot.  flash forward to this week  it has been hell. i barely see anyone anymore. i havent ate for a couple of days and i constantly feels depressed  i cry at work every break and i start to tear up every time someone talks to me. i cant listen to music even though i love music as it makes me sad and increases the saddness. i pray to god on every break i get that i can make it a couple more hours til i can get home so i can sleep. i dont know what to do  im scared of talking to my parents about this as i fear then resenting me. i cant soeak to my roommates or friends in fear theyll think im crazy and although i do have a therapist  he is through my school and i feel as if theres nothing he can do. i cant afford a different therapist either. every week gets worse for me  ive had many times in my life where i contemplated suicide and felt sad but this time is feels different and scary. with every week getting worse i get more and more scared of the suicidal thoughts in my head  ive never been scared of these before until now because it feels real  its feels like one day soon i wont be able to go on. i already act out killing myself when im on lsd. i have a notebook full of letters to people that i randomly made. im scared and i dont know what to do i just want to be happy.,2021-09-27 05:01:17

60768,hey  how s it going   i want to ask really quick if this is normal or not. it s bothering me a lot and i want to get rid of it as fast as i can.  whenever i feel depressed or stressed  i have an urge to cut my wrist to put myself back together. if i didn t try to stop it  my wrist could bleed again. so when that first occured  i put on some music. it triggered a panic attack so hard to control that i have no other choice than hurt myself to calm down. the weird thing is  it helped. the depression was controlled and after a headache it was gone. it did return shortly though  like in a few days.  after that happend  i became addicted to finding music that triggers it. i have gone from stressing a whole day to listening to music in the school s bathroom and cutting myself. noone helped me  so i accepted it. it has been going on for a year.   any idea how to stop it  my wrist can t take it anymore.,2020-08-31 09:22:19

106500,woke up in my coffin   think of my past thoughts   all of it a blurr  as look around my nailed wood overcoten  must have mistaken it for my mattress a while before   laying there in  all darkness   nails start to hammer through   the worry starts kicking  in a panic i start poundering with nails too  with breath in my chest escaping  i cant breath   as i m 6 feet deep   yelling for somebody to let me out my affliction   but these walls are muffling my screams  fighting these wall trying to find a way out  finally i declare death on to me  with all my sadness lay there dreading i might just die here  slowly i start to drown   as the walls cave in   pressure on my chest  feels like my lungs are burning in  knowing i will never come out this box i call home   as they put my name on a tombstone.,2021-01-31 16:43:06
203481,all my life i ve wanted to gain more confidence in myself. when i got to dating age i was rejected left and right for years because people thought i was weird and unattractive because i liked video games and anime. that s fine i guess.. now i m in my 20s and i still feel like a fucking loser. it s funny  as a kid i watched so many tv shows  movies and anime where the dorky weird guy finds he is really good at something like music or art and that brings him happiness  gets the girl and has a huge glow up. obviously that s tv and i didn t expect my life to go like that.. i just feel ugly and like i m terrible at everything i try to do. i feel like my fianc e doesn t find me attractive anymore and i keep trying to find hobbies that make me happy but they always end with me feeling depressed..  that plus financial issues are just really dragging me down and i feel like i m a fucking annoyance to everyone around me because i can t do anything right. i know it s fucking stupid but i m tired of feeling ugly and like i m bad at everything.. it just sucks because i see so many people i went to high school with doing great things and i just wish for once people could see me as cool or handsome or something.. my fianc e never compliments me or pursues me and i just feel depressed..,2022-01-31 15:44:21

102283,i ve had a bad past growing up  more than what a kid should go through.  when i was in year 5 i developed a coping mechanism in which i would force myself to be sad in    happy situations  that way when the next bad thing happened it wouldn t affect me.   at the time it helped  but fast forward to now and i find it an unhealthy coping mechanism.  for the first time i have taken steps and now currently on a dose of anti depressants.    i find it extremely difficult talking about my thoughts to my friends and family.     i can talk about some lighthearted feelings  i m feeling groggy  just a bit sad ect ect.    however i would hate to let them know how much i d quite like to go away.   not that i m unable to find joy  its just that i can t seem to enjoy  joy.    amp  x200b   i m an adult now  get yourself together.   you have responsibilities.   self deprecating cycle.      in my head i m still that kid.    amp  x200b    amp  x200b   thank you for reading     kind regards.,2021-01-18 11:41:08
7066,so i ve known my best friend  m  for the majority of my life  coming up to 15yrs now   and we re usually veryy close to each other. my 16th birthday was 4 5 months ago  i didn t do anything for it because i was finishing my gcses and everything was super hectic because of covid. i mean  i don t usually do much for my birthdays in general tbh  but this year i just kinda let the day go by. when my birthday came  i got a happy birthday message from her which was lovely  and i m not saying that i expect any gifts back  but i usually spend a lot of time and money on m s presents  bdays  christmas e.t.c . i know money can be difficult  especially when you don t have a job  so i honestly don t care about the price   but i didn t even get a card. i ve kinda forgot about it until recently  m s 16th came up a few weeks ago and we went out to dinner which was lovely. she made a big deal about it being her 16th  so clearly she sees it as an important milestone. now  m started talking about what to buy this person from her school  i m at college  and she went to a different school to me before that anyway   which just annoyed me a bit. i ve only heard her speaking about this person for max 2yrs. she posted on her close friends story on instagram   what do i buy  name  ahh    and asked me twice what she should buy for them  never met them before . she bought some stuff for them  and has told me what she got.  like i would have been happy with even just a card  and this might be me being a bit overdramatic honestly  but hearing how much effort she s putting into this person s birthday really makes me feel quite sad,2021-10-11 15:56:29

14800,today the store i work in closed down and we will be laid off without pay  until further notice.  i tried filling out the application for unemployment  but there s so much in it i didn t understand.  i m 30 but probably have the reading comprehension of a middle schooler. no idea why  i m just not very smart.    i hope they approve me anyway because rent is still due on the 1st  no leeway there.   people keep saying   can t your family help you out   my only living parent kicked me out when i was 18 because he didn t want a mentally ill daughter. no  no one can help me.   i don t have a car so i can only walk to the grocery store. i can t  stock up  or buy anything heavy because i can t carry it back to my house. no milk  no juice  no toilet paper...as if i could find any anyway. i don t understand how grocery delivery like instacart works. again  i m not very smart.   i assume laundromats will close. we don t have a washer or dryer in the apartment. guess i ll be scrubbing my dirty clothes in the bathtub with dish soap.   because i m so stressed  i said an insensitive thing to my only local friend  about how i won t care about sick people when i m homeless  and now he won t speak to me. i try to reach out to my online friends so i can have a distraction  but just get left on read. they re probably stressed out too.   i messaged a local charity on social media who s helped me out before. they said they d pray for me.   i don t know where else to turn. if this goes on for a whole year like people are saying  i don t want to survive it.,2020-03-18 20:50:57
6125,i have a very common first name and uncommon last name. this woman keeps thinking i am her husband  whom i share first names with. unfortunately  my last name is the first letter of her husband s middle name and last name combined. so harry edward lix  h.e.lix  is getting mixed up for me  h.elix. she tried to contact me by email  claiming her husband had the email first  i had it since like 98 . she also tried to call and facetime me to get back together with him. i m tired of getting her spam emails she keeps signing up for. what are some things i can do that make it clear that i don t want her emails anymore ,2021-08-13 11:31:32

1609,use a fitted sheet  or large pillowcase  on your dog bed. to wash  instead of having to disassemble the dog bed cover from the stuffing  you can just rotate the sheets.  i have big dogs and big dog beds. i used to struggle to wash the covers and reassemble. my dear departed mr godric developed a problem whereby i needed to wash his dog bed almost every day. inspiration hit  i bought some inexpensive  but soft   fitted sheets  and put them into rotation. much easier ,2021-04-15 11:05:53
5193,if you take a cold shower when it s hot  it causes the blood vessels in the skin to contract   sending all your blood into your core  rather than cooling it down.  instead  start with a hot shower  wash all the sweat off and get nice and clean. then  incrementally turn the water temperature down  only by a few degrees each time. allow the water to wash over you  especially your head and neck  your armpits  your wrists and your groin. these are the areas were your blood is close to the surface  and will help you cool properly. after a minute your body will be used to the temperature  at which point you reduce the water temperature again  and do the same thing. keep this up until you feel cool enough  or  like happens to me  you ve actually turned the hot water off   then  when you get out of the shower  dry yourself very lightly  just getting rid of the drips  and then allow the remaining water to evaporate. this will further increase the cooling effect. i ve used this technique for years  working on oil rigs  and in the middle east where temperatures frequently approach 50 deg c 120 deg f  with high humidity. it s a much better way of keeping  and staying cool ,2021-07-21 11:50:02
131151,sometimes i feel like i m suffocating. like  i go out  put a happy face on  joke around  make people laugh  people like me  whatever. cool. i m the jokester  the funny one. but none of these people really know me or how much pain i m in. not even the person i call my best friend. i m a fraud. the walls around me are sky high and i don t let anyone see my weakness. to them  i m full of life and confident. but it s a lie i tell to world to hide who i am. my mind tells me i m worth nothing. that i am nothing. a nobody and no one cares about me. sometimes i d rather die and end it all  but most of the time i just want to wake up in a different life. i don t want to die. i just want the suffering parts of me to. so i can wake up and be the person i am fronting to the world  instead of faking it.,2021-05-13 17:51:35
1537,so  i rant on my instagram stories talking about my difficulties in my life  i talked about what i ve been through these days  and my friends are replying to my stories and checking me up. i realize that real friends will check you up if you re okay and what they can do for you rather than telling you to tell them what the problem is.,2021-04-09 02:07:28
68632,another night and i m feeling the emptiness of just another day in this hell i call my life. there is no one here not a soul around so i grasp at straws and reach out on reddit but nobody hears my plea for help. the ones who respond usually leave in a few days and i don t blame them because i am just another lost soul and i don t belong here. people have their own problems and don t want some fuckin loser discussing his feelings and listen to him talk about the fact he spends every waking moment wishing he was dead and even though he doesn t believe in god he prays every night for some higher being to let this end. not many people understand what its like to live trapped in your own mind with your demons screaming on repeat.   his mind is a trap yet he continues to fall for it and slowly starts to fade as his life falls apart. the replies of the distant few leave him scattered and confused not knowing what to believe or whats real and wishing he could go back and rewind to a time where he could remember how to feel. when asked he says everything is fine yet hopes for just one person to read between the lines. he s broken beat and down screams for help yet the rest of the world wont make a sound so when he falls asleep he longs for the sweet release he yearns for the peace he prays to end up where the dead dwell but awakens again to this living hell.,2020-10-01 01:29:51
98,i m an engineering student in college right now and i often wake up with a large amount of busy work with little to no motivation to start it. it s daunting for the brain to jump right into the largest task of the day  so something that i ve found helpful is waking up and doing a simple task  tidying up room  putting dishes away  things that need to get done regardless of workload . this simple task completion gives you a sense of accomplishment and fills up that metaphorical tank of motivation just a little  making it easier for you to then get to the meat and potatoes of the day.   hope this helps anyone who feels overwhelmed in the mornings ,2021-02-08 15:20:34

164100,   this probably belongs in  deadbedroom but it wouldn t let me post so i posted in a related thread.   first and foremost  i love my wife and our children. i respect and love her for everything she does and has done even though our marriage is a lot less than ideal  hence this post. i needed another outlet to get my thoughts out and maybe hear input from others as my previous outlet options  i opted to skip out on.  for some background  my wife and i have been together for 6 years  we have a 2 year old and she is currently pregnant with our 2nd but not so far along that she has to be on bed rest.   my wife met me after leaving her last relationship that according to her was both emotionally and physically abusive thanks to her narcissistic ex. not that i was trying to be a  white knight  and save a maiden in distress  but after a few months of getting to know her and dating i decided to drop the world around me and try to pull the trigger on a relationship. our relationship started out typical  our honeymoon phase  lots of physical intimacy  ups and downs  some major fk ups on my end  was hard to transition from a bachelor  i wasn t cheating but quite a few ppl from my past wanted still in or closure  but we made it through. i honestly will say i felt and still feel lucky that she decided to be with me. at the time  life happened and i unfortunately went from a 6 figure job to making a fraction of that and suddenly my life and new relationship took a whole new direction. we had our financial struggles but we made it work. i took on 2 jobs  while she went to school full time. people will say she should have worked but i didn t want to put that stress on her knowing her. all the while  i was also taking classes online to try to get into a different field since my previous role was phased out. fast forward 2 years later  we had moments where things almost ended  but we still made it through. she graduated and i earned another bachelor s degree. since i was raised to try to always have various revenue strains and i ve gotten used to it  i always have a main job and a side gig. well  thanks to covid  making some right moves  and sheer luck  since the beginning of this year i have landed both a main and side gig that both provide a 6 figure income that is work from home. i work a cumulative amount of 60 70 hrs a week which i can say while working is highly stressful  i am able to stack them so while the total is around 60 70  i still don t break 40hrs a week. my wife works 12 16 hrs a week and stays home for the most part to help raise our son with our mothers coming in to help a lot during the week. in all honesty  she doesn t have to work  but i encourage her to do so since she wants to put her degree to use and i don t want her to feel like all she is is a housewife. she pursued her dream career  and didn t succeed. she mostly partied in her 20 s and did jobs she could just to make ends meet. she s been through hardships personally  family  and with significant others that overshadows mine  so i can t say i relate entirely. but i did make it a goal that she wouldn t have to worry about those past stresses ever again while we re together  and for the most part we ve reached that goal.    we both struggle with depression to some degree  i myself don t struggle with depression as bad but i more so get anxiety attacks from time to time. my anxiety kicks into high gear especially when it comes to myself and the people in my life.   so over the years my health has had something in life that has caused me problems physically  i guess it s safe to surmise that our dead bedroom is entirely my fault. to sum it up  a motorcycle accident when i was younger and some underlying health issues involving a benign tumor sometimes makes it hard and takes time to  rise to the occasion.  i ve had a bout of depression because of this a few times and i ve let myself go  going back and forth with my weight  but i m not completely a man blob on two legs. i always joke that i m more maui  from moana  than  jason  momoa. currently with life being a little more stable at the moment  i try to workout fairly religiously and i generally run 2 4 miles 5 6 days a week time permitting. not in the best shape but i m not losing my breath climbing the stairs either. per the request of my wife and my wanting to be the best spouse to her  i ve worked with various doctors and pursued different treatments. while sex isn t as spontaneous and glamorous from our younger days  we can still engage in sex but not to a degree where she feels happy. in the past she s told me that even though her ex was a horrible person  it was probably the best sex of her life. naturally  this just puts my anxiety at a whole different level and to top physiological problems add psychological stress to performance issues. i ve confided with my past  work wife  about this and against my better decision  i showed her what i was working with. while we didn t cross the line of becoming physical  the offer was made by her to help alleviate some of the stress at that moment. i was flattered and declined  but sometimes i wonder if i should have taken her up on it.   i made an attempt to initiate sex last night  ready to go but was denied. in short  she told me again  sex with me makes her feel disgusting. because i m not good enough  not hard enough  not big enough  not this and that  so i laid there quietly. it s not the first time she s said this to me  and it will probably not be the last. a few minutes past and she s sound asleep.   i wasn t angry. i was sad but i had no tears to cry. my anxiety didn t kick in but my depression made my handgun look appealing as i wanted to just go to sleep and never wake up. when i woke up this morning i momentarily took off my wedding ring. while i was taking my medication  i thought to myself  i could take this whole bottle right now  and within a few minutes my heart will slow so much  it would stop entirely. our son tugged at my shorts and i snapped out of it. i teared up a little thinking of what i just thought of as i watched him drink his morning milk.  i try to help take care of our son as much as possible. again  i am lucky my colleagues understand my living conditions and for the most part excuse my abrupt absences or tardiness to meetings because i m helping take care of him.  i guess it s an added bonus they love it when he busts into my zoom meetings from time to time.   my wife came down finally this morning  no words exchanged. i just walked up to my office and started typing this before my first meeting today  and have been intermittently updating as i juggle work and our son at the same time. part of me wants to talk about it  maybe go to counseling  try different things  but it always turns into an argument. according to her i m missing the point. i don t listen to her wants or needs. i m the root of her depression.  i feel like  even after all we ve been through together. all that we ve built together. all that we accomplished together. no matter the strides i make  or how much income i make  or the attempts to be better i make. i ll never be good enough.  i m feeling numb. my mind is steering into dark places. i feel like quitting.,2021-09-07 13:42:48

86417,this is kind of long so i apologize but appreciate it if you read the whole thing  i m lost and in a bit of a crossroads.  to start  recently  about 3 weeks ago to be exact  my grandfather just passed away. i m the oldest of the grandchildren on this side of my family  and the only girl  so i had a really special bond with him. he loved watching me play sports and was a huge part of my life. the week after he passed away i was completely broken  i couldn t even talk or move most days. i got really bad insomnia and wasn t eating at all  i think i went 2 and a half days without eating anything at one point.   a little over 2 weeks later i went back to school again for the first time  which was horrible and so overwhelming  i was so behind and it just stressed me out so much. just when i thought i was starting to get better i started having anxiety attacks from stressing myself out. then a couple days later my city went back into quarantine  so i was completely isolated from my support system.  however  in the last 5 or 6 days  i ve been the happiest i ve ever been in a very long time. even though i can t see and do all the things i desperately want to do with my amazing friends  we ve been group face timing and using other methods to talk to each other and try to have fun everyday. i ve started to become the person i was before again  normally i m very extroverted and talk to tons of people  and i finally have confidence and the happiness to do that again.  but the timing of everything just makes me so guilty. anytime i complain over something small or take too much joy in something my mother always guilts me by saying  how could you be saying feeling that right now  you re grandfather just died you know   it makes me feel like shit. obviously i loved him but he wouldn t want me to be sad  he would want me to be happy but still cherish him. i just feel like my mom won t let me cope and deal with it the way i need to  she doesn t understand. i just wish she could be happy for me right now. is there anything i could say to her to help her understand my point of view without making it worse ,2020-12-03 03:31:37

5023,i m 2018  i had a really awesome roommate in college. at the beginning of our semester in college  we didn t really talk but eventually we became friends. going out to bars  football games  etc..  2019  we both had different roommates. we didn t see each other a lot like we used too. we only spoke to each other every now and then. but spoke to each other every other week.  not all the time   2020  i graduated and almost the entire year  we haven t spoken especially with covid going on and how crazy things were last year.   2021  this year  i haven t heard from him at all since may of 2020. that s 15 months of not talking to or seeing him.  i m thinking maybe our friendship has expired since it s been literally 15 months since we spoke or were we ever friends to begin with    what s your thoughts ,2021-08-15 16:36:44

5078,sometimes i think to myself and i wonder if this is all for attention. that my feelings aren t valid and i m only doing this for attention. but something deep within nags at me and tells me to think about it logically. how can it be for attention when i cry alone when no one can hear  how can it be for attention when nobody knows and i have no desire to tell  but i brush those thoughts aside and i continue onwards because in a way  i need to believe it s for attention. i refuse to address it head on. it s not an issue  it s all made up. i m okay  i m fine. i tell myself these things until i believe them. if i didn t believe them  things would get worse. but now i know it s not true.   i used to think to myself that i wanted to kill myself. but that s not true. i want to die but i don t want to kill myself. i want to be away from the pain and suffering but i don t want to kill myself. i think about all those made up worlds i always immerse myself in and think   the characters lose their entire families  and lives and are thrown into impossible situations but they never feel this way.  it keeps me going. it makes me determined. i m lucky to be alive  no matter how bad things might get. some people don t get to live and experience life. you can only be happy if you know what it s like to be sad. some people die before the age of one. some people die immediately after their life has been sparked  without even a glimpse of the outside world. so i know i m lucky and i appreciate it. but that doesn t stop the feelings.   it doesn t matter  not really. we live  we die  and eventually the last person to remember us dies. we leave no impact on the world. let s say we killed a thousand people. those thousand people die and their families and friends are effected but it doesn t matter. humans will never leave earth anyways.   i m sorry. i don t know where that last part came from. of course everyone matters. of course...,2020-02-16 21:07:55

182386,i m  26m  going through a tough time rn. i m in nursing school  and i found out a girl i had a crush on for 3 years is dating someone. it sucks because i thought i was going to ask her out when she finished school at the end of this year. i m don t have anyone i m open to talking about relationships because i keep myself private. she was the first girl i had the courage to ask out. i feel like everything is so dark and i have never experienced something like this. i try to forget it but i can t. i m distracted from studying and i have been crying for the past couple of days. i don t have a guy friend that i m open to like this or anyone that i talk to about relationships. she has been the only person that i was open to talk about anything to and now i feel like i can t even talk with her about anything because it just feels wrong to me to talk to another man s girl. what do you do when pain like this shocks you  i am crying writing this  but i have to let my feelings out somehow. please talk to me ,2021-11-11 13:43:52
4660,i ve been using insight timer for many years and never had trouble. just got the iphone 13 and suddenly it stops randomly in the meditation and no matter what i do it won t continue the track. i can press play 10 times and nothing. happens with meditations  gt 10 minutes and generally seems to stop around the 15 minute mark. it also has trouble loading the meditations now. particularly if i am trying to listen to a meditation i ve never used before. it just keeps spinning and never plays.   i ve restarted my phone  closed and re opened the app  uninstalled the app  and closed all other apps in the background.  i m thinking this is the new iphone problem  but i m wondering if anyone else has had this issue and could help me troubleshoot it  it is very jarring to be mid meditation and it stops.,2021-10-11 09:25:47
192088,i have had depression on and off since i was 8. i m 25 now. i ve always kinda assumed everyone was depressed because that s what i saw in my mother and other family members.   i ve been at a point now where several years where i am okay with not living anymore. i know this needs to change and i can t continue to see this as something  everyone goes through and deals with     my mental health issues have cost me all my relationships.   i want to feel better. i am going to start seeing a therapist.   i went to the doctor and the first thing he offered me was anti depressants. as someone who has done drugs recreationally  haven t done anything in long while other than weed   i am concerned the drugs will change my state or mind too much. i work in a profession where i am constantly talking to people and must stay mentally sharp.   has anyone had experience with anti depressants and how did it affect your mind  i m worried i will take them and won t be mentally sharp and my work performance will go to shit.,2021-12-16 14:41:15
121986,i think it can be both  but i think modern psychology vastly overestimates the amount of people depressed solely due to brain chemicals. i think a lot of people are depressed due to outside factors  such as a poor social life  disability  health problem  etc.,2021-04-09 17:00:29

5611,my apt doesn t allow window ac units and i ve heard portable acs are annoying to maintain and not very effective.   at the beginning of the summer  opening all my windows at night and closing everything off during the day was enough and my 3rd floor bedroom never got above 75 degrees. fast forward to now and it s sweltering hot. my room was 90 one day. i open everything up at night and wake up to my room already being 75 degrees. idk what to do.   i have three fans  a medium sized one  a desk clip fan  and a box fan  and my room is only 100 sf. i just want some way to bring the temp low and then close everything up so it stays that way.,2021-07-31 01:55:33

8942,i ve been feeling like this for about the past week or so now  and it s been really bothering me. ive been depressed for about a year or so and it s getting worse. i don t want to live  but i don t want to die. i feel like i m stuck in a quasisuicidal state.i keep having the thought of just pressing a button that would just instantly take me out of existence. i fantasize about being asleep forever. i feel like i haven t been myself for years. i feel like i haven t been able to think straight and i m constantly worried about tons of shit  but i don t have enough motivation to do anything. does anyone feel the same way  it would be great to know if other people feel like this.,2020-02-28 02:55:12

1090,hello all  my first visit to this subreddit and i must say the ultimate lpt i could give is probably to never get a bank loan  no matter what the reason may be. no matter where you live  what car you drive  it will never be fun as long as you are living beyond your budget.. no feeling is better than being independent. it is very hard to not compare your self with friends neighbor  but i think this comparaison thing is the biggest evil of our generation. we all know that happiness has nothing to do with material stuff  but somehow we keep ignoring this truth.,2021-03-28 10:38:20

33509,i was gonna go to bed but then had a conversation with my brother. we live under the same roof but we rarely talk to each other.   i came out to my brother today. i should be happy that he  accepted  me. or he made a joke about it but he s a weirdo  like me  and he has a dark humor. i kinda expected that reaction but then i started feeling bad..  a while back my mom told me  she d leave me if i turned out to be a part of the lgtb community.. among other things. she then made it seem like i was the  bad guy  for trying to be honest with her about my thoughts and feelings  for the first time .   back then i thought i was an heterosexual girl but it hurts when they always make me the bad guy for having thoughts  desires  dreams and feelings like everyone else. like seriously  i m a human being just like you. i m not an emotionless robot.. or whatever it is you think i should be.   now i m 100  sure who i am and knowing that these people are never going to accept me.. it stings. especially when the only person who doesn t care about my gender and sexuality will leave me here. soon.   the people around me have made me feel so bad for so many years  yet i keep expecting them to turn around and accept me.   tbh i don t ask for much. i guess that s why it hurts so much to always be unwanted. i ve been rejected by pretty much everyone so far. there s always a reason to dislike me. even if i try to be the best version of myself.   i thought this would change everything.  i love that i can finally be myself  or that s what i thought but now i m starting to feel scared. it s probably just gonna make things worse..,2020-05-24 15:17:38

46571,im so fucking lonely and i m too much of a fuck up to do anything about it. i ve always been a bit of a loner growing up  and i was fine with it. i never really had any friends or a group that accepted me. i was never the  weird kid   i was just there. i m just so tired of it.   i don t really have any friends to be with. i get along ok with the people at work  but that s it. i go home and lay around. that seems to be the only thing i can do anymore. my bedroom is a fucking mess  monster cans from months ago that i just cant seem to get rid of. im not attached to the trash like a hoarder would be  i just don t have any motivation to get rid of it.  sorry for that rant    anyway  i just can t make friends. first  i don t go anywhere or even want to. i cant approach people. i cant hold a conversation. i even tried online  but i have no clue what to even say. i cant read people or the situation around me. at this point  i ve given up on ever having a girlfriend. on top of everything i ve said  im also fat and ugly with literally no personality.   this is starting to kill me. i think i ve benn depressed for a while  but now its even worse. i keep thinking what s the point to life anymore. i m just going to die alone so why not get it over with. i even made a nickname for myself  the unlovable fuckup .  i never tried doing anything  and i doubt i ever will  but these thoughts are terrifying.  i just don t know what to do anymore. i tried calling my doctor  but never got a call back. i tried calling back today  but i just felt like i was going to be a bother so i never did. at this point i just want someone to genuinely care about me  and a heartfelt hug. guess that s too much for me to ask for.,2020-07-08 23:29:47
358,a man riding a bicycle is coming back from work  he leans the bicycle on a tree and he sits under it. he sits before going home  to his wife and child. he closes his eyes and he meditates  monday  tuesday  wednesday  thursday  friday. he meditates every day  maybe he recites a mantra to cheat the mind quicker. as time passes  he becomes happier and happier  and happier. every problem he had  work related  family related  health related  wealth related  existential related  starts to slowly banish as he meditated more  and more. that was his drug  you see  meditation. this kind of meditation  very famous in the west  is utterly meaningless but very comforting.    this story was told by a great speaker. i m not the author. ,2021-02-18 12:35:29
21981,i don t get it. i just don t get it. what possible fucking reason would anyone have for actually caring about me  what on god s green earth could i possibly give back in a relationship  i m annoying  i m clingy  i m attention seeking  i yell and scream at the drop of a hat  what possible benefit could they see in me  sure     maybe    i have some strengths  not even sure about that tbh   but they don t outweigh my flaws  and they aren t exactly useful in a relationship  i don t think anyone wants to be my friend because i can write a decent paper . so what the fuck is it  then  what could they possibly see in me that makes dealing with all my bullshit worth it    it s like i have a bomb strapped to my chest that s about to go off  i keep on telling people to get away or they ll get hurt  but they just refuse to acknowledge the bomb s existence.   i m just so tired of explaining this to people.,2020-04-14 14:02:10
101667,i was doing okay during the isolation from the pandemic. i have an anxiety disorder  ocd  and depression. but suddenly in the last few days i had a panic attack which is not unusual  and i dissociated. i ve had depersonalization before  but this feels like a weird mix. i m plagued with existential thoughts  and the constant reminder that i m alone in my own body and mind. that nobody is with me. i feel the most alone i ve ever felt. it feels like i don t want to be me  that i m scared to be me. i can t find enjoyment in anything  even social interaction seems forced. i don t know what i m supposed to be thinking about anymore  or what is normal. everything is put through the lense of myself  which will die and be pointless anyway. i keep thinking about how people see me as a whole person  but they don t seem real themselves. the constant reminder that reality only exists because of me  and i ll only ever be me  is very upsetting and depressing. is this depression  depersonalization  or can they come hand in hand ,2021-01-16 15:01:15
133,you re more intuitive than you think. more often than not  i ll have constant thoughts about reaching out to someone before forgetting and moving on with the rest of my day   and they ll end up contacting me before before i reach out.   an absence followed by the  i was going to message you  spiel sounds a lot less genuine than reaching out in the first place. you ll maintain a rapport with people much easier when showing a small inkling of thought  regardless of your relationship.,2021-02-10 03:07:58
59741,hello  this is kind of a first to me and i hope i m doing this right.  so some backstory  i m a 21 year old guy who lives a pretty neutral life in europe  nothings specially great in my life  nor do i have the feeling like i should be  whining  on the internet about it  but i just can t deal with this anymore  because i m deeply depressed since i was 16 and dealt with my life by supressing my feelings as a male person  trying to act like a mature man  i self harmed a lot  i am diagnosed to have major nervous depressions and anger attacks. i tried to get help with professionals but they never end well  not to mention the antidepressants that made me feel worse.  to go to the point  i am full of hatred  not only over myself  but also over humanity in general  everything sucks  i know life is blooming and we live at a time and age where we have achieved so much and i m proud  don t get me wrong. but i have such a hatred over humans  that i feel like an anti hero in a batman movie. the mentallity of some people on social media  the brainless comments that jhst make you want to kill yourself bc theres no genuinity  just plain anonymity that gets abused by harassing other people on the internet. not only that  but also some of my friends that are slowly getting on my nerves.. the logic of some friends are just crazy  one keeps using illogical arguments and comparisons like comparing a phone to a car  just makes me angry and stressed out  and my best friend only cares about money and doesnt know much about empathy or sympathy.  so basically i feel very lonely even though i have my friends who could give me company  but i d rather stay alone as i mostly am. i had a car crash a couple weeks ago which drained my money. i dont have a job because the call center job i worked at for nearly a year kind of made it worse.  i ve conventrated a lot on relationships because thats one of the only things i m good at and that gives me hope to continue  taking care of that special someone  being with them is just soothing.. which was more than 1 year ago.  don t get me wrong  she gave me trust issues and abandonment issues  but i got through it  i wanted to conentrate more on myself to heal  untill i met another great person in beginning march  we didnt commit bc we knew what was coming but we had a great time after the confinement  deep talks  emotional moments  trust  everything was there. but she had to leave for uni last week.  we promised to stay true to each other  still friends and talk  but she didnt keep her promise  i am now alone again  dont want to talk to my friends  i decided with her to stop talking for a while because it was breaking me to see her having a great time with new people after she stopped saying  good night  or  good morning  to me. i felt replaced again  i always feel replaced  or not important enough  expendable..  i can t deal with all of this.. i m really trying my best to stay true to myself and my future projects  but i keep giving up in the middle of the way  i hate people so much  i see the bad more often and commonly than the good  if i see the good in someone  i attach to that person untill he she gets cold  like most of them did  and after insults and neglect at my previous job as an apprentice electrician  i wanted to work and yadda yadda to be able to finish my school diploma because i also gave up that in the middle of the way  for the same reason  some of my teachers were shit and i dont know what happened but i gave up.   i started to see a pattern here  i try my best for something  and give up half way  and get mkre and more depressed as i avoid everything and everyone  while at the same time having a hard time saying no so i get out with the same friends with the twisted logic that just angers me  no matter how i think about it.   sigh  long things short i wanted to end my life for years now  i ve had a very long time to think about that decision too. the only thing keeping me from doing it are the people who would be mentally destroyed if i ended up killing myself. but they dont seem to take me and my problems seriously  they know very well about my issues.  one night we partied with alcohol and i drank too much vodka  due to my irresponsible decisions  i fell on my head  stopped breathing and that illogical friend of mine  was very worried  the others already left for home. we arrived at the hospital where i woke up  having a panic attack  started to cry my ass off telling them i didnt want to live anymore  nor do i feel cared of  or listened to  i just wanted to end it all  litterally. and the worst is that i dont even remember saying that at all  that friend told me the day after  with concern in his eyes.  i see how hard it is to take the easiest decision. but i dont see any way out  i dont want to fit the system  i dont want to pay for every single thing my government is asking for me i sound immature i know  but 150  for 1h of therapy and its not even taken care kf by my free health care  i mean how are we depressed and suicidal people supposed to feel any better  or heal in general with that shit     i dont even know if this post makes sense  i never did this before  but i know very well that i m pretty bad at expressing myself  but what i also know is that i m terribally lost  video games lost me a long time ago  no one to play with  very repetitive. smoke weed since i was 17 18 and it doesnt soark joy anymore  i m trying to stop but its too late  i need other routines to be able to stop  but every evening when i feel lonely  i automatically start rolling another one to feel numb again.  please someone give me some good advice  i m really sick of it all and i dont want to take a terrible decision  this post wont make me kill myself if you guys say the  wrong  thing so please be honest  i dont know how to explain what being litterally lost in my own mind feels like  you feel disassociated  logged out  not human.. idk.  thank you for  listening ,2020-08-27 12:16:12
110,this is my opinion and i am not generalizing it to everyone.   i have been paying attention to how people treat the meditation by the content they are posting. not just reddit  but blogs  videos  etc. i found that people are beguiling themselves by consciously thinking that   oh.. i have done meditation for 15 days  or 30 days or 1 year and i now have some magical super brain that is calm and clear.   however  you should actually treat this new brain as normal. it should actually be  oh.. my brain was very distracted by material things and not paying attention to self. this was very unnatural. after doing meditation for this much time  it is coming back to normal. it is becoming calm and clear.   also  some of the titles i read are something like this   i have done meditation for 50 days  look i am super human.  that thought will bring ego about your meditation habit and completely ruins the very purpose of meditation.   so in short  please don t treat your brain as some supernatural brain after meditation  1 month or 50 year . just tell yourself  that clear and calm brain is the natural brain.   p.s. i had the same issue of treating the meditation as something that gives me superpower. but eventually i realized that it actually makes you more natural and self realized person who is not clung to ego  jealousy  resentment etc.   again this is only my perspective.  happy meditation.,2021-02-04 11:23:57

186179,hey guys  so i have a roommate who s been going through a rough patch recently. she was let go from her job and it s made her depression pretty bad. however it s been nearly 6 months and she has yet to start looking for another job. she s living off of her savings but i know she s going to be out of money soon. she also has stopped doing her part in terms of house keeping. most of the time there is food and trash all over our living room and kitchen and a pile of days worth of dishes in the sink. when this first started i just decided to help her out and do the dishes clean up the kitchen etc. but it s come to a point where i m getting resentful and only doing my dishes etc but if i don t do anything about it  our apartment will stay completely trashed.  i work and go to school full time  so knowing that she s home all day and coming home to a disgusting apartment is starting to make me lose it. i guess my question is how do i approach this with her without making her feel worse about herself  i have depression so i understand the struggle  but i can t continue to live in filth or do all of the house work. it s making me extremely stressed and i feel like i can t relax because there s always a mess to be looked at  or smelled. any advice would be nice. i really love her and feel for her but i m at the end of my rope,2021-11-24 18:35:21

67,  what can i claim     staff who are now working from home because of covid 19 may be able to claim tax relief on any household costs which have increased due to home working such as gas and electricity or new broadband connections.   you can either claim tax relief on  6 a week from april 2020  no receipts or evidence of additional costs required  or you can claim tax relief on the actual additional expenses you ve incurred  note  this requires submission of receipts  bills etc . tax relief is based on the tax rate which you normally pay. e.g.if you pay the 20  basic rate of tax and claim tax relief on  6 a week you would get  1.20 per week in tax relief  20  of  6 .     how to claim     you can claim the tax relief easily online through the  govt working from home tax relief service  https   www.gov.uk tax relief for employees working at home . you will need a government gateway user id and password. if you don t have a government gateway id you can create one quickly  note  you will need your ni number and a recent payslip  p60 or your passport . however  if you ordinarily complete a tax self assessment  you cannot use the microservice but you may submit a claim for the tax year from 6 april 2020 up to 5 april 2021 via your 2020 21 tax return  deadline for submission of january 2022 .    how will i get the money     if you claim through the microservice  this will be implemented via your tax code rather than you receiving a cheque or lump sum.this means that the tax code shown on your payslip will be changed and the tax which is deducted from your pay every month for the remainder of the year will be adjusted.      where can i get more information      to check eligibility and access the service via govt gateway visit  government guidance on tax relief for working from home  https   www.gov.uk tax relief for employees working at home   there is also very useful  additional  detailed advice and a full explanation of the ways to claim available from   money saving expert working from home  https   blog.moneysavingexpert.com 2020 04 martin lewis  working from home due to coronavirus  claim p6 wk   ,2021-02-04 02:15:49

86436,unsure if this is the right subreddit but i ve been doing pretty well mentally for half or more of the year surprisingly. having dealt with chronic depression for most of my mid teen to nearly mid 20s  i m 23  i can say without a doubt this year has been the best for my mental health. i just don t feel that overbearing depression anymore though of course a bad day comes here and there.  however  i feel like i m heavily struggling with behaviors that stem from the years of dealing with depression. it s embarrassing but my years of dealing with this i ve routinely had a lack of personal hygiene and my environment hygiene  room  and though i m not depressed i still find it difficult to do these daily tasks. my room still looks as if i m depressed  with trash and so on everywhere.  i ve tried googling and seeing if there s any discussion about dealing with behaviors after years of depression but it s hard to find any relevant results. is it assumed once you re no longer dealing with depression that all of the behaviors go away  if anyone can offer advice or articles  talks etc on this.  i know it s pretty basic but i feel like i struggle with executing these basic things. maybe it s related to being adhd as well since it is an executive disorder but i m not sure where to start looking for applicable methods to my situation.,2020-12-03 04:52:07

162781,ok. i just have to vent. i have a lot of issues in life but being a mother is by far the worst one. i don t want to discredit anyone that truly enjoys motherhood but it s honestly not for me.  i have two sons. one is 3 and one is 2. but the 2 year ols is basically still like a baby because he was born 3 months early. it was very traumatic giving birth to him and i honestly wish i would have terminated the pregnancy when i first found out but i just couldn t. i didn t have it in me to destroy a life that depended on me so i continued with the pregnancy.  their father is not really active in their lives. i have to basically beg him to do anything for me concerning them. i have supported them all on my own with doctors appointments  getting medical diagnosis  insurance  ebt for food  therapy  school  etc etc etc.   small little backstory  i traveled most of my early 20s. i m 26 now. when i got off the road for the 2nd time i started hooking up with a former fwb. got knocked up shortly afterwards. even while not having a relationship with this person  i decided to move forward with the pregnancy. i wanted a baby even if the dad wasn t around. we ended up dating and and having our first son in april 2018. all was well. i was happy  and i had my beautiful amazing baby boy with me who i carried for 9 months. i loved him in every possible way.   fast forward to 9 months later. i find out i m pregnant with baby number 2. i m indecisive about continuing the pregnancy but ultimately decided to keep it.  him  he was due oct. 2019 but i ended up having complications and he was delivered a whooping 3 months early on july 10 2019. i was devastated to have to see my small baby inside an incubator for 3 months and a continued 4th month in the nicu. i traveled an hour and a half away to see him every few days and even pumped and brought my milk because i knew it would help him tremendously. all of that seems so meaningless now because i can t even hardly look at him.  i am aware that i have untreated ppd and have had it since he came home in november of 2019. as soon as he came home  i realized my terrible mistake. i not only have a toddler to look after  i now have a newborn again after my first son finally wasn t a baby anymore. i realized i had fucked up. big time. nothing was ever going to be easy anymore. i had and still have such a hard time bringing them both anywhere. it was easier with just one kid and i was still able to do most things i d just have to bring him with me which was fine. but now there s another human to be accountable for.  every little thing seems to be a chore for me. bathing  meal time  dressing them  loading them up in the car. everything. i am absolutely miserable living this life i ve created for myself. i dissociate most of the time because i m so unhappy. here s another thing  i am very connected with my first son. he means the world to me. my second son  not so much. i can t barely look at him without feeling disgust and almost what feels like pure hatred. i hate his personality. i hate how he cries and whines all day. no he isn t whining because he s lacking basic attention. i feed  change  take care of his basic needs because i know its my duty. but loving on him  no. i can t seem to do it. i don t like touching him  and i don t tell him i love him. because i honestly feel like i don t. yeah yeah call me a bad mom that s fine. i already know i am. maybe part of this has to do with our lack of bonding in his earlier months of life. we basically weren t able to like a normal mother baby would. and that saddens me to the core. but i can t change it.   i have contemplated many times putting him up for adoption or just straight up leaving his brother and never returning. i know that isn t probable and i could potentially be setting him for a much worse life. but damn. i really can t imagine doing this for 15  more years. i am miserable and that s an understatement. i m already a depressed and suicidal person as i ve survived one suicide attempt already. i long for death and sweet release of this hell on earth i ve created for myself. it s not my kids fault. i know this. it s my fault for bringing not one but two kids in this world without any plan on how i was going to raise them. especially without help. the only help i get is from my 80 year old grandmother and you already know i feel fucking terrible for that. it s not her job. it s mine and the piece of shit man i decided to make kids with.   right now my 2nd son has been literally screaming for 30 minutes straight because he isn t getting his way. i don t think i m cut out for this anymore. it was so different when they were babies and it was easier. this is a hellish nightmare that i want out of. please no harsh judgment. i know i suck. i know im a terrible person and i don t deserve them and someone else is out there that would love them. they re bad. they re really bad and both of them basically scream all day. i m sick to my stomach. i want to hide in my room with the door locked and scream into my pillow.   i keep hearing that it gets easier but it doesn t. it hasn t. it s not going to. i have half the mind to give them both up and leave forever. i think they d be better off. if you read this far thank you. i appreciate it.   also just wanted to state that my oldest son has autism and is behavior is out of control. the youngest mirrors his behavior and its fucking exhausting. i hate my life.,2021-09-02 19:05:06
33623,i don t know what s wrong with me. whenever people get close i ruin it. i feel like they re talking shit about me  they don t actually like me  i m bothering them  etc. then i lie and make shit up to sound cool because lord knows there s nothing interesting about me.    especially in relationships. i work myself up and overthink everything. i always think  oh they re cheating on me i better get back at them  and it s so fucked. i hate thinking like that and i hate feeling like i m disposable to everyone i interact with. the people that have shown interest in me i end up slowly ghosting and canceling plans until they stop talking to me.    as of now i have no friends  and the way my life is going  i don t want any. i m not ready for any relationships right now. i hate myself  i m flighty  and i don t have the energy to care anymore. i want to fix myself but it feels like an uphill battle. i m trying to do more things but i m so tired and sad all the time it s hard. if it wasn t for my dog i wouldn t get out of bed most days. life sucks. thanks for reading my rant.,2020-05-24 21:30:14

544,i just had a great experience buying  400 speakers from an american who used ups to send them  to canada.  ups dinged me a  95  brokeage fee ... which i paid online. he heard about it and refunded me their fee out of his own pocket.... amazing   i subsequently found out  from an article  https   www.theartofdoingstuff.com how to avoid broker fees just in time for online xmas shopping   you can tell ups to stick the brokerage fee up their ronson by  self clearing  the items... here s how the article summarized the process     instructions    1. do not agree to ups acting as your broker. not through email or when they re at your door. just say no and do not accept your package. 2. email or call ups and say you are going to self clear your item. ask them to email you the necessary documents. 3. bring those documents to your nearest canada border services agency  must be inland offices  4. pay your actual taxes and get your stamped forms back along with the b 15 form they provide. 5. email the forms back to ups to prove you paid your owing taxes. 6. wait for your package to arrive free of charge.    notes    ups will try to avoid doing this. they ll pretend not to know what you re talking about. they ll avoid emailing or calling you back.  pester them if you have to because they do know what you re talking about and they have to by law give you the information you re asking for.,2021-02-23 11:37:30

84596,anything and everything i do is pathetic. i m turning 18 next year february  yet i do not act like my age. heck  even the person i romantically like is so much mature than me despite being 2 years younger than me.  i have a lot of physical issues. for instance  i have psoriasis  which can t be cured. i live in a place where mosquitoes are very common. my psoriasis only got worse due to my injuries triggering them  to both my entire legs  my arms  my right eyebrows  my entire scalp . because of that  i can t wear jeans or tights and have to resort to extremely baggy clothing. i come from a very conservative family  so i always wanted to wear my favorites  summer  comfortably. i have keratosis pillaris as well in my entire body and face as well. and these are just the surface.  my household is a mess. specially because we have been financially struggling since 2015. even my hair is a mess because of bleaching and dyeing it so many times.  i get to talk with my therapist once a week and because of that i feel bad to even speak my feelings out to anyone now. i m getting the necessary treatment for a thing  right  do i really need to complain to another person and burden them with my problems   the fact that i got myself a therapist after i openly tried to stab myself doesn t make this less worse. and it s for free too since a relative of mine is actually a well renowned psychologist all round.  i m extremely unhappy with my self. i want to talk with someone. i want to hug someone. i want to cry to someone. anyone.  i want to stop constantly crying too. i continuously cry even in my therapy sessions. i feel scared and horrible. i m not a very good person either  as i have ignored so many  discarded many for my selfishness  yet i m wanting someone to help me. comical  isn t it  and i am hilariously unfunny and hilariously annoying.  my family sucks. my body sucks  so does my personality. regardless  i would still continue to hate myself even after removing all those aspects from my life. i used to have suicidal thoughts as a 3rd grader too  i found a dairy from back then where i descriptively wrote about wanting to not live anymore .  i m having such a hard time coping. can i just not feel anything anymore ,2020-11-27 19:56:36
37777,getting through the day is such a slog. nowadays i self harm to break the monotony but it doesn t really work. other distractions don t help anymore either. been watching the same youtube videos day in day out to take my mind off it all but the thoughts are always there. i shouldn t be here. i have no purpose. no one cares. how i wish i had someone to share my thoughts with. anyone. the loneliness never goes away  no amount of youtube  video games or music will ever fill that emptiness in me. i wish i could die.,2020-06-08 14:21:17
1953,when i was a child  i used to dream of all the great things i was going to do. nothing would hold me back. i was going to be an astronaut  an engineer  or even a doctor. i was going to have a life full of happiness and innocence. i played games that gave me such great memories. i gained friends. i felt happy...  it is true that ignorance is bliss. for i came to realize the world is not happy  innocent  or fun. as a teenager  i got diagnosed with major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. middle school and high school helped me realize i was not good enough to do these things. i hated myself. i still do. i attempted suicide a year ago. went to a mental hospital. got  better.  it just came back. i knew deep down it would. the feelings of worthlessness and sadness and overwhelming despair. i had to quit my job due to the lack of motivation.  i miss my childhood. where everything was so wonderful. where death was just a part of life and not so much a way out of it. i am beginning to think it is the only way out of this mess. why couldn t i just be normal  why couldn t i be dumb so i wouldn t see the problems    i didn t choose to be alive.,2020-02-07 01:42:50

194355,it is indeed the day after christmas and i am reminded of a few things. depression kicks ass on sight and holds no bars even for baby jesus  his cuckold dad and his whore of a mom. my birthday is coming up and how it works in my house is that i don t talk about it until christmas is over and even then i feel ignoredwhen talking out loud about my plans. fine  who cares my birthday has never been important it s after the biggest event of the year  i get it.  i have no friends which is also ok so i want to do something solo but i live in the belly button of a country   very insignificant and boring  doubly so with the big v doing what it does. i m off my meds too so that s fun as well so i did try to drink bleach but it hurt like a lot and i was heaving  and all that good stuff  don t do that   . my sister actually hates me  not in the sibling rivalry way anymore and that means when she does anything fun i m not invited and im too anxious to go anywhere by myself. my one online friend is drifting away from me which is fine if they want to do that but im reminded that i have nothing and i am nothing and more than anything i d like to forever  sleep.    amp  x200b   happy new year if you make it.,2021-12-26 11:44:19
4907,hi all  last night i decided i want to learn how to meditate  i put on a 5 minute clip on an app and tried it. i don t even know if you could call it meditating but i felt really calm and peaceful while doing it. it was pretty heavily focused on your breathing and letting thoughts just go by. after it  i opened my eyes and had a euphoric rush. could anyone explain this  was i meditating  thanks for anyone who replies  i ve never done this before.,2021-10-26 08:18:45

20694,why only people who lost part of their life can appreciate life       i have bad eyes with high myopia  it keeps me from doing anything fun in my life  90  of my life is pain and headache  i haven t went outside of my room since the past 3 years except for important things like shopping  before that i only went to work and back home  not a single touch with any human  with zero friends. i made a peace with myself that i can t enjoy some of the beautiful part of this life like traveling the world and enjoying beautiful places having friends  having a partner who i can enjoy the life with  but still my goal is to watch all the beautiful movies and shows  listen to all the good beautiful musics  play all of my favorite video games  but even this looks so impossible for me  with bad vision that prevents me to stair at the screen for a longer time  my vision is getting worse each year  thats why i had to quit my job  which was hard core taking 90  of my time  so i could get back to my life and do what i enjoy while i can.   so yeah there are so many beautiful things in this life  and life is too short to experience all of it  if you have physical issue for your depression then i can understand you  but if its not something physical then i just want to slap you on the face so i wake you up  i wouldn t lie to you if i say i envy you  if hurting yourself would fix the issue then i would ve stabbed myself every morning to get ride of the pain and enjoy the rest of my day. you got something precious but you are not appreciating it  if you want to sleep  you can sleep when you die  for now enjoy the life while you can  life is not a fantasy  there is no perfect friend or a partner or prince princess partner that you should wait for him her  so if you are so depressed that you can t enjoy your life then change it and fix the problem  run to the woods or travel to the next city  get a divorce from your toxic partner if he is the reason for your depression  get married to someone and enjoy your life    find a hobby    stop being friends who makes you feel bad  start making new friends  there are a lot of people like you and your are not alone  do whatever you have to do to change your current life style asap and enjoy the life while you can    life is too short to wast it sleeping  .   life is too short to wast it sleeping  .     if i could stay a wake without getting sick for no sleeping  i would never sleep in this life.,2020-04-09 18:59:40

186386,i m 33f and my online friends are in their early 20s. for some reason  they really value our friendship even though i can t go to them irl because i m just a cash poor  unhealthy  unemployable and undateable autistic person from a third world country that is in a different continent. my friends are wonderful  kind  smart  talented  and very capable  while i m unattractive and totally useless. i don t even know why i m so important to them that if i die  that would trigger them. if we happened to meet in real life instead of online  i m pretty sure they d hate me or at least avoid me because i m toxic on many levels.  they ve gone through a lot of traumatic shit in their short lives  enough for lifetimes  that i can t even imagine so i can t blame them for wanting to die. stuff like getting beat up within inches of death or getting raped more than once and or coming home to abusive families while having no friends they can talk to. hell  i want to die even though i m living a relatively comfortable life. at least nobody s bullying or abusing me outright. but that doesn t change the fact that i don t have a future and my life is meaningless now. i m too depressed and discouraged to do anything. even when i feel motivated somehow  my body falls apart and i can t get anything done.  so what if i have it  easy   is that what life is about  avoiding bad stuff  my family and other friends don t understand  they ask me why i am so unhappy when nobody is hurting me. why am i not okay  they expect me to be happy because i don t have the problems other people have.  count your blessings  and whatnot. well  nobody is hurting me  that s true  but the only people who see any value in me literally live oceans away and could die any second and i can t do anything about that. i don t have the right to tell them not to do that to me.  maybe it s my fault for making things worse  i don t know  but i can t act like everything is okay either. i m trying not to talk to them at all while i just want to quit existing. it is so hard  i want someone that i can talk to about anything  both bad and good  and there aren t any. i m too weird to be regular friends with. all the people i m friends with now have mental issues and i m not supposed to burden them. but if i m feeling fine and i need to talk about my interests  i can t find anyone for that either.  i just cannot catch a break   the only way i could get close to my online friends  one of which i am in love with  is to marry a foreigner who is based there. get with someone i don t love to be with someone i love  see how crazy that idea is  and the age gap is more than ten years  it s shameful for me to want him. i m total garbage  who would even want to be near me in real life   this is total mindfuck and my body hurts every day  i can t stand it anymore. somebody kill me. i m sorry but i can t take it anymore. i ll just come back here eventually  feeling hopeless again. just end it already. i m done with this life. if someone wants me to live  but i can t live for them  what s the point telling me that  i m not allowed to make someone the meaning of my life  so i m still empty.,2021-11-25 14:51:16

71919,i m depressed and have been for a year. i started school again and i was  happy  for a month ish  just the novelty of having friends again  and now i m falling back into my hole.   school is ruining my mental health more than anything. i see an assignment and i just break down. my parents offer to help but i refuse. you d think that if it bothered me enough i d just ask for help  i know i m stupid but i just  hate help. just the thought of trying to do the assignments makes me cry  even with help.   i ve also relapsed after 3 months of being clean so that s great  so yeah sorry for a little rant.,2020-10-13 13:22:41
29159,warning  long story ahead  i am currently 16 years old. my family and i went to canada when i was 13. i live in this small city  where there is nothing much to do. in my first school  gr.8   i can barely speak english. i can understand what they re saying  but i don t know how to respond back. there are no students that have the same race as me  it was really hard to adjust. i wasn t able to make friends as i am always quiet  because i can t communicate   every time there s a group project  nobody wants to group with me and they already have friends. there s also this time where the school went swimming and all of them knows how to swim.  all my classmates went to the deep pool  while i was on the shallow pool. i felt left out. i ask my mom to put me in swimming lesson after that  in my country the majority of those who can swim is rich people and fishermen family . i keep trying to improve myself. i was able to make friends with one of my classmate because he is my neighbor but i have to change houses. i transferred school because it s the start of high school. i went to a k 12 highschool  means most students already know each other. in my grade 9  there is 2 students who have the same race as me. one cannot speak the race language and one who have been at that school for a long time. i also made friends with some of the students  but they already have a group they hangout with and they ve been friends since elementary  it s k 12 school  my mom picked the school  i didn t.  i tried to join volleyball to make friends and it looks fun  but all the players already knows how to play and i m the only one who didn t  the coach kind of looks annoyed at me and some players just laugh  not in a mean way  because i can t do the same way they were doing. i quit because it kind of hurts my self esteem. i don t have any friends to eat lunch with and i tried to sit with some of the friends i met but they also eat with they re friends in other grades and always talk to them about something i don t know about. i felt left out. back to the 2 students with the same race as me  one is a girl and one is a boy. the boy cannot speak the same language as me and the girl can. the girl feels somewhat wary of me that i might take her friends away from her so she doesn t talk much to me. the boy and the girl have been in the school since elementary. i wasn t able to be friends with them. since i want friends  i ask my mom if she can put me in a swim club but it cost  1000 and we can t afford it. i wasn t able to make friends in grade 9 and i was always alone. i was able to make one friend i always hang out with in grade 10  a transferre  but she transferred halfway through the grade. another student transferred to my class and we become friends  i introduce her to some of the friends i have  they already have group they hang out with but we can still be considered friends  and she seems more closer to them. they are all canadians  i m the only one who is different  and they are more comfortable to speak in englishand talk to each other  while i still somewhat struggles to talk super comfortable in english. i am also aware that it is somewhat boring to talk to me  and i can understand that they are more comfortable to each other since they speak the same language since they were born. the were all very nice  but it still makes me feel left out. sometimes they were talking about things that i don t know about and sometimes they only talk to each other. i hang out with them everyday  but i still feel a bit left out. i also tried out for badminton because it also looks fun  but i m the only who doesn t know how to play badminton and i m the only one who didn t make it into the team. in the summer after that happened  i ask my mom to put me in a badminton camp to learn  it cost  150 and we don t have money to spend on that camp. i just forget about it. in the city i live in  it s extremely cold and doesn t have much places that you can go to hang out. the mall is extremely small and doesn t have much stores. i also doesn t go to mall that much since i don t have money to buy the things i want in there. i don t even have money to buy some drinks or snacks to go around the small. my family also doesn t give me money for school  allowance  and all my lunches are from home which my mom cook. when i also bring lunches to school  my friends often comment how my food doesn t look good  my mom only cooks the food we use to eat back home  and sometimes i feel ashamed of the food i have since it s different from what they eat so i won t eat it and just throw it in the toilet after school so my mom wouldn t find out  i know it s bad to waste food but i don t want them commenting about the food i eat . i also feel self conscious about the clothes i wear since i ve been wearing those since gr.5 and all of them are second hand from our churchmates. i only have about 15 clothes my family bought in canada. i also feel a little bit sad at home since i got a new brother. i used to be an only child for 14 years and we have additional member. we have to be more cautious about spending money than so much before. he also have eczema which added much to our finances. my dad is the one who works for our family and he earns enough to pay for the things we really need. i want to take a vacation in the place where i grew up to just take a break from the culture shock in canada but again  we don t have enough money. my family also depends on me a lot on houseworks since we don t have any relatives in canada. at home  i prepare my lunch  sometimes when my mom is too busy to cook i cooks food for us  but it is rare   i m the one in charge of cooking rice  washing the dishes  we can t afford dishwasher   cleaning my room  cleaning the floor of washroom and kitchen. and my parents still feel i m not doing enough houseworks. my mom also sometimes feels depressed because we don t have relatives in here to helps us and she is a little bit not used to taking care of baby since it was 14 years of age gap but she still does her best. i only complain sometimes about housework because i try my best to understand her. when there are emergencies  i ends up taking care of my brother most of the time. my brother cries a lot and it sometimes annoyed me because when i m studying for school he is so loud and it really stress me out. my parents also sometimes get stress to his crying and they sometimes end up pouring their stress to me by making me to do more houseworks. i am always stuck at home after school and i want to join some clubs so i can put my mind at something fun  but we cannot afford so. my parents often complain that i m always on the phone  but we cannot afford anything for me to join clubs. when i tell her there s nothing to do that s why i m on the phone  they will make me do more housework that s why i just stay quiet. i really really want to go out sometimes  but we really can t afford to do anything. i just feel super duper depressed since i went to live in this city but i cannot do anything about it. all the things  i want to do i can t do. i have friends to hang out with but i still feel a bit left out. when my friends and i hangout  they re parents are the one to pick and drop me off since my dad sometimes gets mad that his gasoline goes to waste. i just feel sick of staying at home and my parents take full advantage of it by making me do a lot of housework. i just feel so tired and i don t know what to do anymore. i just feel like my life cannot always go this way but i don t know how to change it. i feel like i try my best to make friends at school but it still makes me feel left out  everything s different about me and i try my best to fit in with their culture and language. i just feel so tired seriously. i really had enough of this life.,2020-05-09 15:27:50

60808,long humiliating vent. the last few months  i ve used my state s crisis text line several times. i ve got a bad week coming up at work and just hoped i would be able to talk to someone about what i m dealing with and how i m feeling.  the person who answered was someone i ve spoken with once before  and she remembered the gist of our previous conversation.  she seemed annoyed with me. she told me   the issue is that we have offered to get you some help  but you are choosing not to do the things that may help you.   which... doesn t seem totally accurate to me. the  help  they offered was directing me to psychologytoday.com and telling me to search for a therapist there  which has been a bust.  i live in a rural area  so options are limited. i ve been looking for almost three months now but haven t been able to find a therapist who accepts my insurance  is taking new patients and works with people like me  nonreligious adults  as opposed to couples  families  kids teens . i m still looking. but it s been frustrating and i feel pretty much hopeless  honestly.  i had just wanted to talk to someone about how i ve been feeling  because i can t share this stuff with anyone in my life. but instead  i got lectured on how i m not doing enough. i swear i m trying. i m doing as much as i can and i m trying to get more help but keep running into obstacles. my efforts are just never good enough. whatever i do  it s wrong.  and then i noticed the  we  in her statement and i realized that the crisis line volunteers are all in a building somewhere. that they must talk to each other. that they ve probably complained about me and how pathetic and difficult i am.  i felt humiliated. i still do.  she told me i was being difficult because i  started our conversation with a list of things you ve tried that aren t helping.  that was in response to her asking if there was anything i could by myself that would distract me or help me get through the week.  i explained that i ve tried everything i can think of to distract myself cope while i look for a therapist and none of it helps  because my ability to focus is shot and i don t enjoy anything. that s a big part of my problem   i can t distract myself from my thoughts  i used to be able to  and there s just no relief.  but i guess that was the wrong answer. she didn t want me to tell her things that i d tried that weren t helping. i don t know what i was supposed to say instead. i was trying to be honest and forestall the  well  have you tried   xyz    follow up. i don t know. it was stupid of me.  i apologized for wasting her time  but she insisted that she was  here for me  if i still wanted to talk. so i told her that i was really worried about work this week  i have a project i don t feel equipped to do and i m covering for a coworker who s on vacation  so it s a lot of pressure  and that was what had me upset.  about 5 minutes after i sent that message  she just said   i m going to let you go. please consider what step you need to take.   god. it s just so embarrassing. even the crisis line volunteers are sick of me. i m an inherently unpleasant person. i m lazy and i don t do enough. honestly i should ve realized that they wouldn t want to talk to me. i won t bother them again.  this will sound stupid and dramatic  but honestly  the  step i need to take  that comes to mind is to quit waiting around  prolonging things  and just kill myself already.  that s what keeps coming into my head. and it scares me  but at the same time  i know it s the right thing to do. i m a bother and an annoyance and an embarrassment to everyone in my life.,2020-08-31 13:11:35
1224,since 2017 this person has gone out of their way to wish me a happy bday.. sounds stupid but it really means a lot..  none of my  friends  even do it and to just have someone acknowledge it makes me happy...  if i have a wish.. this is it..   i wish everyone would just treat everyone how you d want to be treated. i wish we could all put aside our differences and just love each other and listen to each others stories.  i m tired about all the bad that happens in the world...   what about the good     i want to hear about random acts of kindness.   i feel like we tend to forget them with the abundance of fuckery in the world.    so  for my bday  i would love to hear if anyone else had any random person make you feel great. or witness a great deed ,2021-04-06 04:30:50
73315,hi everyone.  i just wanted some feedback on my current situation.  i have been throuuuugh it over the last week.  i think i have had a nervous breakdown following chronic stress coupled with an anxiety disorder.  for background  i have been trying to have a baby for the last two years without success. this has been very hard but i thought i was dealing with it okay  as best as i could. it has been a constant cycle of hope and then heartbreak  month after month. the hardest thing i think was not the not having a baby per say  but more what it did to me as a person. i felt it really broke my spirit and chipped away at me as a person.  in july  i went off lexapro  thinking i was doing okay  in hindsight  clearly not the right time of my life . i had suffered from anxiety since 2013 and had been on lexapro since then  and had not had one panic attack or even really thoughts of anxiety cross my mind in 7 years. i have been a confident  capable person.  in august  after much deliberation and never wanting to have to get to this point  i started ivf and was excited about it only to have the cycle cancelled for low response which was a massive blow  when i was so vulnerable already.   i then started a new job  which isn t stressful  and was doing well  have still been down about my infertility but felt okay on the surface.  which leads to two weeks ago   i was at the hairdressers and had terrible period pain. had somewhat of a panic attack and felt trapped  but not full blown. i got through it  and was okay the rest of the day kind of got over it. but then started ruminating on it that week  and got scared of the anxiety. i started my lexapro again  and then 4 days later i had honestly what i consider a nervous breakdown  even though i know its not a medical term.  i was in bed for a week  crying  terrified  felt like i was losing my mind  i had no idea what was happening  i didn t know if i needed to go to the hospital. my husband had to take the week off work and weather the storm with me. it was the most intense thing i have ever been through.   i m still dealing with the aftershock. i don t know if its the lexapro kicking back in  its been two weeks  but the heightened anxiety has died down and i am feeling depressed. i m also feeling very emotionally disconnected  like i look at the people i love and know i love them but don t feel it. i ve had thoughts like  what if i harm someone  but i know they are just intrusive thoughts.  i guess i m scared i m not going to be the same again. or even unsure what actually happened. was it an acute  long anxiety attack  i really scared myself.  if anyone has any insights that would be so helpful ,2020-10-19 00:14:59
185210,ever since the start of lockdown i am feeling very down. its the first time i felt depressed in my life and its very tough. at first i used to freak out about it. about the self harm thoughts i used to have. now its has all become so casual  so routine. i don t see any meaning to this life. i have made up my mind that i would never have children. its horrible to be born.   last year i started talking to a redditor. it was the first time someone gave me attention like this and i used to tell them everything on my mind. that also stopped like 6 months ago. i still talk to her in my head almost everyday which is weird. i try to stop it but i can t.  ever since i got depressed my escape has been to masturbate whenever i feel down. used to do it 5 6 times a day and waste many hours each day watching porn. started getting into weird fetishes. have controlled it a bit now. also during this time felt unsure about my sexuality. never fancied guys before but now i think if i ever get a gf i won t be able to perform  i know i wont get someone in the first place .  never felt so unsure about myself. i hate myself so much now. i feel angry helpless and hopeless. i don t even want to imagine myself getting happy or better. it is like i punish myself mentally. those who have been like this  do you ever go back being normal ,2021-11-21 12:11:08
157012,i don t really know how to begin talking about my situation  but i basically feel like this pandemic destroyed my entire life and there is no coming back from that. in a sense  i feel like my purpose in life has already been killed off  but yet i remain. so  my existence now seems pointless. this is gonna be a long post  so consider yourself warned.  i was always a bit of a shy boy growing up  so i didn t have many friends during childhood. my first ten years of my life i lived in the united states. then i lived the next 8 years in mexico. when i was 13  i decided that i didn t want to be so lonely anymore  so i decided to do everything i could to make myself more social. but  by doing that i realized that i couldn t actually identify with my mexican peers and i became depressed at the age of 15 when i saw old photos of my time in the us. i realized that living in mexico essentially meant that i would never have a regular teenage life like anyone else would. no friends  no going out  no girlfriend. i became increasingly depressed until i was 16 when i realized i had the chance to come back to the us for college. so  i spent the next two years just getting by  not really living life  waiting until i graduated high school to go to college. i survived my depression during that time purely because of the idea that i could have a great life with tons in friends in college.  well  i get back to the us and find myself still being lonely because my time in mexico completely messed me up socially. looking back  i can t believe how socially inept i was. naturally  having expected to have all these friends  but almost never having the chance to hang out with anyone after school brought back my depression during my second year of community college. this time  i didn t have the same hope that kept me going in mexico. in my desperation  i turn to religion. once i  converted  to christianity  i was happier than i had ever been. in just a matter of months  i made a huge bunch of friends. nevertheless  it wouldn t last long since it was already half way into my second year doing an associates degree.  i then transfer over to a 4 year commuter school thinking i would have the same social success i had previously. and boy was i wrong. i had even less of a social life here than during my first year back in the us. if i didn t have the opportunity to see my friends from community college  i d basically have no social life at all. i really started questioning my life and even questioned my new faith  after only one quarter at that school  i decided to apply to other schools. i got into this one state college known for being a party school. i continued to go to this school since i wasn t 100  sure if i wanted to transfer out  and tuition was 100  covered by financial aid  so i figured why not continue studying while i make my decision.  i decide to transfer over  so i get myself prepared to attend. i make a group snapchat for all the people attend the same orientation as i am. orientation comes and my first day there is awesome. after we do everything for orientation  we gather a few people up from the group chat and have a party at the dorms. we do the same to play poker the very next day. seeing how i could gather all these people together made me very excited to attend this school. so  first week of school comes and i absolutely love it. i meet some other students during welcome week and we have a party at a guy s house on friday. just that night  i end up going to 3 different parties and don t return home until 8am the very next day. so  i finally felt like i would have the social life i always wanted since the age of 13. but  there were still times that i felt lonely. so  the next school year i decide to make my own club and rush a frat. even at this point  approaching the age of 23  my social skills are still a bit iffy  and me technically being a senior despite having 2 more years of college makes it so that i don t get a bid from any fraternity. but  i was able to get into a new fraternity on campus as part of their alpha class.  my fall semester of 2019 was pretty meh since the fraternity was just getting started and i had just started my club. but  things were really starting to ramp up in spring 2020. my school gets selected to host a prominent speaker from my clubs hq  so we were gonna be getting full support from hq to promote this event and for recruiting new people to my club. also  my fraternity grew to 20 members and were going to start having their first social events with sororities. i still have a bit over a year left of school  but i knew that it was going to be the time of my life. i could just imagine how much bigger my fraternity was gonna grow  how big my club was gonna be  and how i would graduate knowing that i could tell my 13 year old self that i finally accomplished having the best social life at the age of 23. almost a decade later. it felt like a dream come true.  but  of course  that very same spring the pandemic hits. i lived in a studio at the time  so i spent the rest of the semester entirely alone in my studio. regardless  i am perfectly fine with the hope that classes would still be in person the next school year. i still thought about my club  my fraternity  and my dream come true. summer goes by  number of cases start going up  my school administration panics and one month before classes start they decide to make everything online. i am in shock since i know that means i won t be able to do club meetings in person  and not be able to do any fraternity events. still  i am hopeful that classes next semester will be in person. also  i started seeing a friend i fancied in july 2020. we were seeing each other 2 or 3 times a week and even cuddling during movies. i had never had a girlfriend at that point  so having a chick between my arms resting her sweet little head on my chest felt like heaven.   we do online recruitment for my fraternity which sucks ass. we only get one new guy since 400 out of 500 guys drop from recruitment  and there are 22 fraternities competing for the remaining 100. once recruitment ended. i text my friend to see if she wants to go out. i had planned to take her out to a farmers market to ask her to officially be my girlfriend. but  when i ask her if she is free that weekend she responds that she can t see me because her parents wanted to meet her new boyfriend. i absolutely cannot believe what she is saying to me. at first i thought she was joking  but she actually had gotten a new boyfriend during the weeks prior. those weeks were the same time that we hadn t been seeing each other due to conflicting schedules. so  with classes being online and the girl i like essentially betraying me  i cry my ass off for the next few weeks. despite this  i still had hope for the future. i am absolutely heart broken for months and then i find out that even spring semester will be online. i was around friends when i find out  so i hold back the tears from the news. our fraternity starts to dwindle as people drop. we started the semester with 15 people  but end it with 10. by the start of spring 2021  i am an absolute wreck. i spend most of my time either in bed or crying on the floor. i m 24 years old and instead of having a dream come true  i am living an absolute nightmare. i m graduating in a couple of months for which i need to look for a job  but i couldn t even sit down for 5 minutes to look for one because of how much of a wreck i was. at that point  my only priority was to survive. i was barely able to graduate since i almost failed one class. some clubs i was with gave me their farewell s and i had to do my darn hardest to contain my tears.  i went to mexico for a month to visit my family. i was completely soulless and not able to enjoy my self at all. i felt completely ashamed because instead of coming back home to enjoy my victory  i was coming home with completely destroyed dreams. i cried every single night when i visited my family. now  i have been back to the us for 2 months. i still cannot believe what has happened in the last year. i feel completely robbed of my dreams. instead of having what i have always wanted  i am back to being completely lonely. i am currently living in the basement of a house  i have no friends  still haven t had my first girlfriend  and i am too depressed to consistently look for jobs. after the disaster the last year has been  i can t really see myself recovering from it. i have been having thoughts of wanting to be dead since january  but it wasn t until recently that i genuinely want to commit suicide. i thought that time would heal my wounds  but my depression and thoughts of suicide are becoming ever more pervasive. because how in the world can a man deal with all their hopes and dreams being robbed from him in an event that only happens once every few hundred years  at this point  i have no more hope left. i am doing everything i can to survive  but it s becoming more clear that maybe suicide is my ultimate fate. i was gonna be a man that had everything he ever hoped for  but now i am a man with nothing.,2021-08-12 20:48:02

9951,i m talking about the ones that start with  new study finds...  one  those articles often don t even link to the study they re referencing. two  just because a study is published doesn t mean it s peer reviewed. often the initial publishing is so other researchers can do their own study after seeing the procedure  and can verify it or debunk it after repeating the study. three  without looking at the study yourself  you can t see the author s potential conflicts of interest. scientific consensus  peer review  is what makes a study s conclusions valid  not an argument from authority because the author seems to be an expert in their field and or works for a prestigious university organization.,2021-11-30 15:10:26

1548,i m not sure how to feel about a friendship i currently have  we re both 26  we became best friends in college and more distant during university but have recently reconnected. he s actually helped me a lot with my mental health and i ve been able to move on from something in my past.  he s quite an awkward person and doesn t converse easily so when we hang out i usually have to start the conversation until he begins to chat more.   the problem i have is that he never seems to ask about my life or be interested in what i ve been doing. i ve kind of stopped messaging him a lot because the conversations don t go anywhere   for example i ll tell him i ve been out or busy with work expecting him to ask questions but he never does  just says something like  nice  which kills the chat. he will talk about his own work for quite a long time which i always ask about. his way of making conversation is to just send me snapchats or memes with no comments and then get annoyed when i don t respond.  he is also quite insecure in our friendship and has openly admitted being jealous of my other friends. if i mention them he quickly puts them down.   the other day i saw my former best friend from school and she was showing such an interest in my life it just showed me what i want from my friendships.   he also has a strange habit of occasionally sending me a series of very intense soppy messages about how much he misses me but then goes quiet for days after.  the whole thing is exhausting and maybe i m overthinking it   a lot of my close friends have moved away so he s one of the few people i have. i just can t help but feel like we ll drift apart if things don t change.  btw i have spoken to him about this and he says he is interested in my life and wants to know  everything  but he doesnt know how to ask about it.   mainly venting but would be interested to hear other people s opinions.,2021-04-22 08:33:48
7060,my friends don t actually respect me in any way possible . they always like to belittle me and are either trying to make fun of me or trying to be know it all. idk if i should leave them or put up with them for 2 more years,2021-10-11 11:48:29

77037,can anyone relate  i was a  gifted  kid and people around me kept blowing smoke up my ass. i learned quickly that if i wasn t my harshest critic  no one would be  and i d end up an airhead with no self awareness who stopped improving at everything because they thought they were hot shit. so yeah  i m not gonna go around congratulating myself for doing a normal thing after 2 months of procrastinating  or for not fucking up my eating for a single day. every time i have ever given myself an inch  i have taken a yard. why do people think they know me so much better than i do ,2020-11-02 22:17:02
89994,i really don t know how to explain it  but i feel like shit everyday. i don t even know how to talk about it with my therapist  my anti depressants don t even work. i just wish i was dead everyday  and even though i got a bad infection last time  which will probably scar for a bit because of that  i still just want to hurt myself  my right arm is just covered in small marks from digging my nails into it to hurt myself  and i don t know what to do anymore. i don t even know how to describe how i m feeling  and then i feel like i m just faking my emotions  that it s not real  and i just wish that i were dead. i hate everything about myself  all i do is burden everyone around me  and i don t understand how anyone can even stand looking at me  everything about my body and face just looks wrong and bad. i can t even vent to my boyfriend without feeling bad about it  they ve said multiple times it s okay for me to vent  but after my last relationship where my s o didn t like venting  i m insecure about that kind of thing. i can t even focus on my own thoughts and put this into words  when my friend and their brother are non stop arguing  and i just want to be alone  but it d be rude to get off call just because of that. i just want to feel better  but i don t know how to. i can t even think straight when there s so much arguing when i m on a call  so i can t even put anything into words. i just want to disappear. i just wish i were dead  but i don t want to burden everyone around me like that  and all i can think about is what would happen to my parents and my two dogs if i were gone  i can t let anything happen to my dogs  i d rather die than have them get hurt. anyways  i just needed to try and put my feelings into words  i m going to just leave this post off here.,2020-12-13 14:39:49
191000,i don t enjoy anything anymore. my wife is a full time student  i work full time  and we have four children. i want to spend time with my wife but i don t know how and the only time we ever have is an hour or 2 at night time before bed so we watch tv  and i hate it. i spend all my free time trying to numb myself until i have to do my next task or can go to sleep. i used to enjoy video games but now they make my wrists hurt more and more. any time i want to go do something i can t because i have to watch our children because my wife is either at school or doing homework. i feel like a prisoner in my own home. i would rather stay in my office and try to block out their noise than deal with trying to take all or some of them somewhere because they act terrible together. i feel trapped  ignored and unappreciated. i know my only real contributions to the family are that i make money and i am another adult in the home. i am literally no better regarded than a roommate  and often treated much worse. i hope my anti depressant dose gets dialed in soon  i can t take much more of this.,2021-12-12 10:38:27
15667,i wake up in the morning  and all i really want  all i can wonder is when will be the next time i get to shut my eyes and finally rest again. i live a life where the meager  and passing if at all  enjoyment i get are from carnal desires  i can slam my dick through my  hand again  choke down some more fucking food  or sleep. at least a 12 hour slumber feels close enough to not being alive.  it s not that it hurts being me  it doesn t hurt  nothing does. numb is loosely synonymous with what i feel  because  quite frankly  i don t. i feel nothing  i smile  when it seems appropriate  but i m not happy. i crack jokes to hear someone laugh  hoping to live vicariously through what they re experiencing. don t get me wrong  i laugh  i can watch a comedian ramble for an hour and a half like anyone else  but the giggles are mere imitation of the crowd. i wouldn t say i m angry  though i m prone to scream  once this balloon filled with minor incidents which i mentally exaggerate the depth of to the fucking stars is inflated to the point of bursting. i breathe because i can t do that to my brother and god  god oh  god why the fuck not  why can t i just have that peace. that clarity  even if momentarily  that freedom  even if imaginary  that sweet release of  this  even if forever.   if you ask me how i m feeling  fine. i m feeling fine. fine doesn t mean what it used to  these days it means you re being financially or mentally charged  and in the end it doesn t fucking mean anything is good  not alright  not even  it means shit. fine means shit. all i really want is to have a reason to exist  not just being shot out someone s cock and now i m here  but a reason to continue existing. i like to make people happy  because maybe i can pretend i m happy with them  but i know better. i can t make anyone feel anything good  can i  i just exist   adjacent to others. why can t i just feel good  why  if i do get a good laugh  a genuine expression of what one might call positive human emotion  it fades like a stain being bleached away off of the floor  suddenly insignificant  as if it never existed. then it s just me sitting there  dead  not literally of course  as unfortunate as that might be. i keep thinking that  maybe if there s another person in my life   i ll feel more complete.   but that s a lie  two halves might be able to make a whole  but when it s one half being clashed against whatever fragment i am  it doesn t add up. my only thought of how to fix this is a selfish attempt to use a human being  a title which i m not even sure i even deserve  then who am i to do so    i need to feel something  i m not sure if it s sex  love   death  or all three in a perhaps satisfying conclusion to this less than satisfactory novella of a story my life makes up. i have friends  but i m lonely  family  but i m loveless  a job and goals in life  but i m truly worthless. so i go to sleep. sometimes  what i can only assume is the masochism in my body  wakes me up after 6 or so hours and i can t go to sleep  and as such i must trudge through at least 6 more hours of living real life than i would wish upon my worst enemy. you heard me  i try to sleep 12 hours  a day  at least. i want to not be awake  awake is when i can think clearly  when things make sense  and when things make sense  all is lost  like me.  how do i feel good again ,2020-03-22 07:27:32
6846,you re cutting into plastic. all those cut marks  zoom in real closely  see the plastic you re cutting away  that s going in your food. slowly but surely the small plastic bits are making their way into your body. maybe on your veggies  maybe on your meats  maybe bring melted down in your stir fry  think about it.,2021-09-02 19:04:30
22272,i ve experienced a breakup like 2 3 days ago and it was really painful since she was really important person in my life and helped me with my depression and self confidence a lot. i feel like  shit again and my heart feels like it s burning constantly  i can t sleep anymore and cry maybe 2 hours out of the 10 that i m awake so i don t know what to do to feel better or even forget her  maybe someone here can help me i would be very thankful.,2020-04-15 19:20:27

22261,99  of the stuff i unload is just shit people  need  to do things at home while they re quarantined...  the other 1  is essential  like some food items  but mostly cleaners and stuff.  i hate my job to begin with  and now i m stuck because so many places are closed out of business not hiring since everyone s mostly home.  i don t know how essential i feel. it feels more essential to the business not tanking than it is to actual moving product for people in neighboring communities.  they also play a corporate video on a loop  and it feels like propaganda. i feel like i m losing my mind even more than i have.   well you re lucky to have a job.  don t go there...that s not what this is about...  it s about how this aspect of my life is feeding my depression even more than anything else right now  and i repeat  i feel like i m losing my mind...,2020-04-15 18:19:45
2677,due to the force of the water pressing on your hubcaps  it can cause the clips on your hubcaps to come off  also  check to make sure the snaps are all the way in. if your hubcaps look crooked  they re unsnapped in part. this is true even for new teslas and older cars too    another little fun fact of roads i learned that is good to know a bit  reason potholes aren t repaired asap is because the weather must be consistently above 60  preferably 70  and dry for the fill to properly adhere ,2021-05-14 16:32:25

474, this is a  mostly  united states lpt  when you place the order at the drive through  there is almost always a turn to make around the corner of the building to the pickup window. now if you follow directly behind the car in front of you after placing your order you often cannot get a car length pulled forward  especially with all of those gas guzzling suvs in the drive through lane. murica  but if you swing out a bit and pull straight forward and not directly behind the car in front of you the next person will be able to pull up and order. then when the car in front moves again steer back over that tad into the lane for the pickup window. now this doesn t do a damn thing about getting your order any faster but if people were aware of the idea and followed through then it could save you time and make your local fast food spot more efficient,2021-02-20 22:39:34
824,hey everyone  i figured since the pandemic hit  the chances of making new friends in person kinda went down  for most states . so  i figured a way to help with that was to make a super group chat  where we can share tiktoks  talk  basically just have a good time and support each other if need be  it s definitely going to be awkward at first but  you know great things come from awkward places  lmao    ages  18   25 lgbtqia  friendly please be kind to one another  if you re homophobic  sexist  racist  etc. you should probably sit this one out.  reminder  my intentions for starting this  was to create a big friend group  should you meet somebody who you want to start dating just be careful and get to know them    you don t have to share anything that you re not comfortable with sharing  but anything you do decide to share please let it be the truth.  also  if you meet people and start your own mini group  that s completely fine  the whole point was for you to find friends and you did that    i was thinking about creating the group on snapchat  since it has games  but if you have alternatives  like instagram or something  i m completely open.   if you re thinking of joining  think of the potential group name     even though my account is old  i m new to reddit  so be patient with me while i figure everything out on here ,2021-03-13 16:33:06
6044,so towards the end of last year i went into a young adults worship group night. they re great and all  but i actually feel more alone with knowing them. i m someone who doesn t have many friends and never has. but when i make new friends or acquaintances i want to hangout here and there. but every time i ask to hangout they say   we ll see   or   i ll let you know ... it makes me feel like they don t want to  which is fine  but i wish they d say that straight to my face if that s how they really feel.  because saying the above makes me feel like i m not accepted or they don t really like me. so i never feel like asking anyone because i always get that response so i wait on the other people to ask me. and once in a great they will  but jeez  i feel more alone knowing more people... anyone else have this problem    alone  thinkingtoomuch,2020-02-19 17:01:34
8314,to clarify  i m talking about items like deodorant  tooth paste  birthday cards  etc. not only will you save yourself money from the purchase price  but you ll save future time and additional resources to replace those items.  as a side note  general hoarding is unhealthy and should be discouraged.,2021-10-15 10:26:57
84445,i m a 20 yr old f. this is going to be a long post so please bear with me. also tw for mentioning an ed   she s actually my cousin  but i personally define it as a sisterhood since i grew up with her in the same household. my mother and father never got married  it was honestly more like a fling and had me. when i was three years old  i was taken in by my father because my mom had her own family   my grandmother insisted that i get legally adopted plus my father side was more financially capable to raise me. basically  i was raised by my grandmother and aunts  my dad works abroad  he would come home every 6 months and stay for 1 month  and finally my two cousins. my older cousin is a m who is two years older than me  and my younger cousin is a f who is 4 years younger than me. so in that order  i m the middle child.  anyway  i m basically an intruder in their home  and i have both vivid and hazy memories of being reminded that i m not an  original  part of the family. i was bullied by my older cousin because i was considered weird and dumb  and i would always come crying to my grandmother who told me to ignore my cousin. the bullying was further aggravated by the younger cousin because  well  they were siblings. and i m the cousin. sometimes i would even get blamed for crying because they thought  i let my cousin bully me.  my aunt was no help either  i could feel that she favored her children over me  and rightfully so. a memory i could never forget even with how hard i tried was during christmas time  in which i sat outside their room with the door open and they were laughing and tickling each other  and i remember the feeling of utter longing for the same thing. i was around 5 to 6  years old that time. the only person i felt safe and comfortable with was my grandmother and father.   there was a time where i grabbed a random family picture and drew horns on my family except for my grandmother and dad. my aunt discovered the photograph and i got punished  even my grandmother was astonished. additionally  my father side were people of mathematics  accounting and engineering. i was the lone artist  and while they didn t take it against me that i pursued arts  they constantly dumb me down.  for example  whenever i get something right even in the smallest of things  they ll act  surprised  sarcastically  shocked because i apparently got something done right .  it wasn t till my aunt s pregnancy of her 3rd child  another cousin who is 12 years younger than me  did my familial relationship get better. due to circumstances  my aunt spent most of her pregnancy around my presence  and i guess that helped in alleviating my ill feelings towards her. now she feels like a mother to me and i feel comfortable in her presence. my older cousin matured and stopped bullying me  we actually get along very fine now. all in all  i became so much happier with my family starting around 6th grade.   now for the younger cousin. i don t hate her  but i d rather not talk to her anymore. see  she was considered a star child  she was and is pretty  slim  and smart.  i m on the chubby side  and i m not exactly conventionally pretty.  people knew she was going to succeed because she is an a straight student  and i m was honestly jealous of her. not in a villainous type of way  but i just wished i was loved the same. i d say i even admired her. i don t know how to put it in words  but i feel like she doesn t think of me the same way i think of her. i care  well cared  about her and i really wanted to be a big sister to her  but she makes me feel so inferior. she doesn t call me with honorifics  which honestly hadn t bothered me until i realized it was maybe because she doesn t respect me . she makes fun of me for liking anime and kpop  criticizes me for what i wear and tells me i wear too much makeup.  says i was trying to impress boys. see when you ve been called ugly all your life and you finally get your hands on things that will enhance you  you d grab it. i don t wear makeup for anyone but me . but whenever she needs help in some of her arts homework  she would turn into an angel. and guess i welcomed that because it was the only time she was kind to me.  her classmates and friends view her as a gentle person  but with me  she s just so mean. i guess she s the type to separate her public and private appearance and that s honestly valid to me  but i wish she wasn t so harsh to me. before  i would try to be the bigger person and just a  ignore her b  bicker back playfully. but ever since i developed an eating disorder   my depression and the fact that we are quarantined together  just me  her and one of my aunts because of circumstances   everything is going to shit.  i opened up to her about my ed  and while i didn t tell her explicitly that i had anorexia  i told her i had difficulty eating and that comments like  eat more  really bugs me. i told her i didn t liked to be called dumb because of our childhood  and that comments about my body will literally send me to a spiral. i was convinced she d understand because she looked like she was genuinely concerned for me.   lo and behold  i told all of her that and she still continues to call me dumb. just two days ago  i jokingly told her to give me her pants because i ve sized down to her siz  and she told me  condescendingly   it won t fit because i had a flat ass. this sounds harsher and meaner in our native language. i specifically told her i detested comments about my very flat bum . a while ago  she joked about me eating more than i usually would.   wow  you re actually gonna eat that    she continues to tell me these comments knowing that it takes so much out of me. whenever she tells me something mean  i would just stare at her and ignore her. i don t know if it s just a subconscious thing for her or its her personality but whatever. i started ignoring her  and i honestly don t have the energy to talk in this house anymore.  i m so done. my depression is so bad these days that i blank out and stare at people when they re trying to talk to me  and it s aggravated by her comments. my aunt made a passing comment that usually wouldn t affect me anymore but i just. blanked. and totally shut out.   i think my family doesn t realize the extent of my mental illness. i feel like they re downplaying it because i m a loud and outgoing person. asian households don t usually take mental matters seriously. my cousins have made fun of my anorexia and suicidal thoughts  i m constantly dumbed down. i just want to disappear. i just want to be loved genuinely.   tdlr  i was raised in a family that made me feel like an outsider. was constantly dumbed down and made fun of. it got better but the pandemic happened and my  cousin continuously downplays my mental illness and makes comments about my ed  my body  and my dumbness.,2020-11-27 07:34:28

8809,that way  if you ever randomly think about your old house apartment  you will have a video of how everything looked when you still lived there. it will be nostalgic to look at every once in a while. also  you will inevitably randomly try to remember exactly what everything looked like years later. when that happens you will have a video of how it actually looked  and you can compare it to what you thought it looked like.,2021-10-27 09:27:02

50714,i am okay with constructive criticism if anyone has anything to say. it isn t going to send me over the edge. but i feel like i have completely lost all control of my life. i try so hard to get back in control  and i just can t. i am depressed  i am lonely  i have trust issues. i have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety. for a while  i thought i had autism because i have sensory issues with my fingers and i feel like i can miss social cues and that i generally come across as weird or creepy to most  but i got tested by a psychiatrist and they do not believe i have it. they do say i fit the perfect mold for a schizotypal  a condition i had never heard of until recently. mainly  i need help figuring out ways i can start to gain control. i am 29 years old  and for a few years i have lost a lot of hope. i don t have nice clothes  hair and i let myself go. i am not huge but i could stand to lose a few. i feel like no matter what i try i am judged or ugly. i deeply dislike myself. i have tried to go to college and i have tried to hold down a job  and i get so depressed and suspicious of others that it always screws me over.  long story short  i got an opportunity to go to france for a shot at education. i have always wanted to go there  but i feel like i am not mentally prepared to do anything. i feel like i could possibly crash due to overwhelming depression. i cannot go to family for help  they suffer worse mental illnesses than even i do  and they switch between using logic to illogic in the blink of an eye. i had what i thought was a close friend recently start talking crazy and i had to just stop being friends with them because they were being pretty unfair to me. i feel like i will never achieve a goal  have close friends  or a family. i feel like i am drowning  like there is an overwhelming sense of doom. i often feel like my life is meaningless. i am not threatening to kill or hurt myself  i just really need to vent. tonight i have been feeling a bit sorry for myself. feel free to post if you want.   amp  x200b   if you got through this  thanks for reading.,2020-07-24 04:27:08

124109,i live in a house with siblings and single parent. last few years i have been studying higher education and use that as an excuse to be somewhat absent in terms of responsibility for the younger sibling. other sibling is older than me and they re somewhat feeling the same from what i can see. but obviously  they deal with it better than me. i just want to curl up in a ball and melt away  i hate having responsibility. i hate being reminded that life is basically effort. i hate that life doesnt revolve around me and me only  which is selfish  but thats the only way i would be able to stay in my moods for days on end and do whatever i want to feel better. i know i get low mood but recently thought i was autistic which would explains social anxiety all my life and wanting to be alone too much and refraining from being an adult unless im doing it to appear as normal as possible. bringing this up to my parent however was just met with confusion and laughter  because even if i were  until this year of covid i ve done a great job of hiding it  if i even have autism .   tldr  just feeling like im making a big deal out of nothing right now and have realised i don t like doing the simplest of things these past few months. its not so much depression as much as i think of it as being overly logical about what the meaning of living really is. i try to bring it up to my parent or siblings and no one takes me seriously  as if its a phase or as if they re going through worse which invalidates my feelings. can anyone relate or do i simply need to get a grip lol ,2021-04-20 17:58:05

196592,i have a good job  a loving gf  friends and family  but i m tired.  i go to sleep every night at late hours because i can t sleep and wake up feeling exhausted. not even physically  emotionally  mentally. i hate that i have no  excuse  for this. i don t think i ve been genuinely  happy  since the last 4 5 years.  so i go to my meetings  hang out with my friends and put on a big smile and a goofy silly attitude and everyone laughs and we re all cool. then i excuse myself to an isolated area  bathroom  usually  and just try to gather some strength to hang in there because i cant  fake it anymore  but i don t wanna ruin the evening for everyone.  i ve tried not going out and it s just worse  since i work from home this house became my world and my tomb at the same time. not seeing people makes me  even more  sad  being with them leaves me exhausted.   my gf is aware of this to an extent because i don t wanna worry her that much. she knows i ve taken medication in the past after being diagnosed  by a professional  of course  and that i m a  gloomy person  when i m alone. i don t think she knows just how much.  i m tired of this facade but also don t wanna be my old self again   that was worse.  and when i look around and count my blessings i just feel so undeserving of them all. and yet here i am.,2022-01-04 01:25:29

92874,my first semester of college ended two weeks ago and i didn t do pretty. i m thinking about dropping out. i graduated high school a few months ago so i m still trying to get used to this transition. this year has really opened my eyes to almost everything. i don t start the spring semester until later in january so i have a little less than a month of break right now. i cried and broke down way too much during this semester. i even beat myself up over my failures  it was close to suicide. if i do drop out  i m thinking about going for an electrical apprenticeship at my local community college. i think receiving a certification and being trained for the job would be nice to have. but i know nothing about trades. i ve never had a job  though i just want to work at this moment. i feel like recent high school graduates shouldn t go to college immediately if you re stuck like me  but also know that there are other options. i don t even know anymore. i m completely broken to the core. i don t even know where to start.  i wanted to go to college so i can become a nurse or a physician. unfortunately  i don t do well with online classes. i get distracted easily  even if i look away for a split second. i completely lost all my motivation during this first semester. i don t have any skills besides being bilingual. i speak english and my local cantonese dialect  also currently learning mandarin. i ve been so depressed that i just want to return to my home country and live in my family s village.,2020-12-21 21:50:58
2380,hii  i m gonna say this first off  since most people don t read all of my post.    do not message me if you won t try to become friends with me  i certainly will. i mean if you casually wanna talk  i m sorry  i m not the one for that.   do not message me if you don t like to voice call.   that being out of the way  if it doesn t apply to you  just ignore it.     i know that at best i ll get 1 or 2 replies  and i will certainly post it everywhere lol  sorry if that bothers you  you have two choices though  you can message me or ignore it. well thing is that i need friends. y all will tell me that i should be looking for them in real life  and i know that ok. but well it s just so hard  people are not easy  despite me making my best effort to be nice to others.     therefore i have been left to interact with people online  but even that isn t working out.  please if you see this message reach out to me  i promise i m friendly.     i m not looking to talk to anyone in particular  i just want someone as friendly as me  and that s able to voice call.     i m an open person  and a fast replier  you ll be surprised  so dm me. i ll be very happy if you do. thank you  and hope to see you there.,2021-05-19 19:45:07
60757,fucking hell  i am just a mess right now. i ll get these brief sparks of motivation and confidence  and spend some time looking for work or writing or whatever  but they fade pretty quickly and i m back to laying awake for hours  not wanting to sleep because i feel so unsatisfied with what i ve done for the day to sleep. i haven t had a drink in weeks  i m trying not to spend what i have  i m expected to move out sometime early next year and still haven t found work. fucking hell i want to get wasted and just pass out forever.,2020-08-31 07:05:22
87991,i can t stop thinking about killing my self and i m so fucking tired of it. i m either in bed all day thinking about how i would kill myself or i m out trying to get drunk or off drugs enough to not think about it and end up being a shitty person.i need to see a therapist but i don t know how i can afford that. i just don t have anyone to talk to besides the people here.,2020-12-08 00:45:19
9006,not only will you have a better understanding of what is being said you will also build your vocabulary in the process.  looking up words by simply highlighting and right click or copy and paste has improved my vocabulary as much as  or more than  any other practice.  best part is it doesn t really take any effort.  plus a better vocabulary enables you to more accurately and precisely express your ideas.    if you think a word is being used incorrectly  it s best to look up the definition. more than once i ve been surprised to learn the word has several definitions and was being used correctly.    even for words that i can understand in context but am unsure of the exact definition  i usually look it up so that i can add it to my repertoire.    if it s s something you ve heard and don t know the spelling you can ask google or siri and most of the time they ll give you the spelling with definition.  i also use this strategy sometimes if i know a word i want to use but don t know how to spell well enough for spellcheck to have a clue what i m saying for example  a word like repertoire.    i feel like a grandpa saying this but i remember when finding a definition required locating your word in fat paper dictionary.  that was too much work  but now that it s so easy i don t see a downside.,2021-11-01 19:36:55
83067,i told my parents i am depressed and they just changed the topic at first. when i refused to talk to them after that  they finally acknowledged it and apologized. however  they think that everything is fixed and now i should be over the said depression after our phone call. they constantly message asking how i am and want to call me. i have mentioned again and again that i need space. i understand that they are worried since we live in different countries  but i am not sure why they can t put aside trying to soothe their anxieties for once and give me the space i need to take care of myself. if i contact them  then they would want to talk about some random topics and i am not sure i can handle that right now. at this point i have resorted to just ignoring the question about when i ll call  and answer their texts here and there to keep them off my back. i have tried explaining but it s clearly not work and i am not sure how to be any clearer when setting my boundaries.,2020-11-23 08:28:23
2078,hello all  looking to make new friends  preferably at least 20yo. i m transmasculine  ftm  and just bringing it up so if that s an issue don t make it one here and at least you can go about the rest of your day in peace.  i have an interest in chatting   at least weekly  hopefully more   and have a wide range of interests. i like psychology  particularly personality disorders and the development of them  and it s a bit more of an intense interest than a hobby. i also like watching netflix  anime  tv shows and films   gaming grinding for achievements on steam though my game choices are limited for now. i m looking for people  male  female  non binary idc  to talk with rather than just do things with  though obv both are up there. deep conversations aren t a must  especially when first getting to know one another  but i think genuine friendships should be built on actually liking someone  not just having enough interests hobbies in common. dm pm me.,2021-05-09 10:49:39
70358,over the past couple of years  my depression has taken me to a really dark place and my family have been urging me to talk to them about it more  but i really don t know how to do that. i ve never been open at all to anyone about it and  when i ve tried to bring the subject up  they always shoot me down with one of those   you have nothing to be depressed about   or   it s because you don t exercise enough   comments.   i want to be more open  but i just don t know how.   any advice     thank you ,2020-10-07 19:58:30
6194, when you don t use logic  judgment in relation to music and arts  other non verbal languages you have easy life being in a meditative state of mind.  on weekends i ve decided to use social networks only with visuals and music as a language.  getting sufficient amounts of sunlight  sorry non verbal communication which is deeper than speaking language is of utmost importance. besides  it s much purer.     for music  i have replicated the following list of  1480  artists with music messages to listen to and stream at soundcloud  https   soundcloud.com yoot digme following  for arts i m picking selections of the following eyes    https   twitter.com literatura  rte   https   twitter.com menschohnemusil   https   twitter.com gregcatarino1   yes  i use some logic though  but this is only my favorite  technology  book of the moment.     when was the last time you have been in a meditative state of mind for the whole day   why are 15 minutes of  meditation  is good for you      what are your non verbal ways to communicate ,2022-01-16 04:38:12
629,years ago  when yikyak was a thing  i met a bunch of people from yikyak and we created a friends group. somehow  the group never became sexual or weird and i got to know them. we ve remained friends  though sometimes the group is not very active. if any of you would like to join the group  let me know. i like making internet friends.,2021-03-03 22:29:38
174637, i think i m depressed. most of the time everything seems very pointless to me and as a result i have little to no ambition to do things to better myself  even though i know it d probably make me feel better. i really don t like the way i live but i can t really bring myself to do anything about it. i m careless enough that i m comfortable in my situation  even though it makes me sad. i m very moody. i m excessively sad a lot of the time to varying degrees. some days i really don t feel like doing anything  and my mood is made worse by any inconveniences. this usually leads to self indulgent behavior like oversleeping and overeating  being unproductive for hours  and substance use  this hasn t been a problem as much this semester compared to the last two and it may be helping me feel a little better but not noticeably closer to normal . i do this instead of doing work i should be doing  hanging out with friends  or hobbies i enjoy when i m motivated. i do this because i feel sad  even if i feel like i don t have much of a reason to be. i get cynical and critical and pessimistic and insecure and uncharacteristically introverted and i feel like i m a pain to be around and tend to be angry at myself because of it. but at its worst  i don t care enough to worry about it. these episodes last for several days and are sometimes set off by something big not going my way or having a rough day  but also seem to come on without provocation as well. i think i feel this way more often than not  particularly during stressful times.   i ve felt this way at points throughout my whole life but it s been consistently bad over the past few years and getting worse as i get more tired of feeling this way so much. it s affecting my ability to perform in school  pursue things i m passionate about  and make and keep friendships.,2021-10-16 03:07:56
5910,do it in real life  it s way easier and much more efficient for your unique situation. if it s a technical issue  you might want to try asking reddit  but mainly focus on your technician.   post sounds ironic because this is an advice  but oh well   ,2021-08-07 15:41:36
8139,life in the pandemic has involved work and school moving onto conference call platforms  but despite nearly two years of this  my colleagues in the teaching profession haven t adapted to the impersonal and indirect nature of online classes and online meetings.  remember that in a face to face interaction  people will use many non verbal cues to decide if and when to speak.  in a conference call  most people are passive participants. more importantly  they will not know when they can speak when they cannot figure out who is speaking next. so either no one speaks  or one person drowns everyone else out. you cannot ask a call with 100  participants a general question.  whoever is hosting   chairing the call needs to bring order to chaos. if it s a small meeting  invite specific people to make a comment   if they have nothing to say  they have the opportunity to say so. in a larger call  have a clear agenda of who is presenting  and if you require input from the general participants  give them an avenue to do so outside of the call.,2021-10-10 07:03:49
68792,so back in school  i started finding it noticeably hard to learn around the age of 13 14  i had a test for dyslexia but i never got the result. im guessing i passed as it was never me tioned again. looking back i feel like i may have add or something. my mum says i was just lazy  but even at university  which i scraped into  i just find concentrating and focusing so hard  i read stuff and have no idea what i just read  like i just cant process information very well both reading and auditory. ultimately this lead to me becoming depressed and anxious when i was 13 14 i think. id get so frustrated and was self harming when i was like 14 15. very few people ever knew this  a few friends  and my sister who accidently saw once. i d play games to escape reality. i was struggling with work  and no matter what tips people gave me i couldnt concentrate on it. and it end with me either playing games burying my head in the sand or getting very frustrated and self harming. i stopped when i was 16 i think  when i was being forced to go to a waterpark   i couldnt hide it so i  accidently  burnt my arm to hide the cuts.  anyway  the issues were still there in uni  i couldnt concentrate  in lectures i was always clueless  and it was never anything that difficult  if a lecturer asked me a question i could never answer it. i couldnt process what they had asked me  and then think of an answer  and come up with the words to say it. i got a 2 1 law degree  basically by listening to very loud airplane white noise  it cant be music because it stimulates emotions   drinking red bull  and post nut clarity lol. how i got a degree  i do not know  its a joke.   so i have a degree  i m 22 now. i want to apply for a few graduate roles and some undergrad apprenticeships in engineering  most of the graduate jobs are in the military  and i can t do these jobs if i have any kind of diagnosis for a mental illness. and i may not be able to do the job without help because of this illness. i don t know what to do. the obvious thing would be to get a diagnosis  but beyond just the military complications  im also afraid of getting a diagnosis  i have no one to talk to and feel trapped in my own home. my dad thinks im just self loathing all the time and a  cup half empty  kind of person. when that isnt the case  i like myself  i have ambitions  but i also know my abilities. and i dont think i can do a graduate job. i made enough mistakes working in a friggin supermarket. i struggled to understand simple instructions. its hard to explain because it sounds so stupid  id always ask people to repeat themselves and then always start questioning whether they said what i think they said or if they meant something else. i just felt and feel dumb af.,2020-10-01 18:47:26
14981,my mom treats me like shit just because she ruined my life so much to the point that i had to make terrible life choices just to be happy for a small little while. now my mom thinks that i m a junkie because i was prescribed a certain medicine. i can t deal with this bs anymore she wants me out of the house,2020-03-19 15:40:58
61705,personally  my mother had me when she was 35 and my dad is 10 years older than her. the fact that they re way older than me and might die soon kills me. even though i m only 15 i always spent time with the adults in my family so i picked up a lot of their thoughts and think differently than others my age   it trying to be cocky  that s just me. also i spent my time with adults because my brother and cousins didn t like spending time with me as i was younger by 5 years than the youngest of them  i think more than normal about the future and i point out all the negative possibilities and just cry for hours. my mom told me that my father acts too fast without giving things the appropriate thinking time. so she tells me to be careful around him and my brother in case she dies and i get my inheritance. my mother is almost 50 so she talks to me as if i m 18 or older because she wants to give me all advice before she s gone. i know she wants what s best for me but it s too much. i m already breaking inside without her knowing and this is too much for me to handle. i can t even get over the fact that she might be gone before i get married. it s scary. i get terrified thinking of the many terrible things that can happen in the future and i can t stop. i m still scared of my exams and what if it all goes south. but my mom gone makes me cry like a baby. the future makes me feel lost. like i can work on a plan and do everything i wanted or one small mistake can destroy everything. sorry for the ramble i just needed to vent. i thought about all of this while trying to sleep some i m writing it to ease things of my mind a bit so i m sorry for any mistakes.,2020-09-03 20:53:21
162557,trigger warning     i m 20 years old and i ve had depression since age 11  that i can remember . as i ve gotten older  the urge to kill myself has gotten stronger and a lot more likely than when i was younger. when i was younger  it was merely a thought and something that i wasn t sure i really wanted. after my brother died of an overdose when i was 13  i felt like i couldn t take my life because my parents had already lost a child and i didn t want them to have to carry the burden of losing two children. my brother and i were adopted so i felt i had even more reason to stay. i m in a wonderful relationship with a great guy but i m miserable and the world is just tainted by a dark lens that won t lift. maybe i don t want it to. there s a comfort in being depressed. no one can hurt you when you already see life for the shithole it is. it can t get much worse when you view the world through the eyes of depression. i m too pussy to end my life though but i know that i think about it everyday. death seems much more possible to me when i m in that funk nowadays and i would even put myself in positions that could potentially endanger me. when will the pain stop or will it just get worse until i m 6ft under ,2021-09-01 20:36:47
3286,when i sit and meditate i start getting all these insights and things i should do which makes me want to actively recall these insights throughout the session so i don t forget them but this behavior inhibits a clear mind. on top of this i m surrounded by people who have high limbic system arousal which sort of rubs off onto me. thoughts suggestions ,2021-07-21 12:35:32
13689,i told my mum how i feel  so that i feel depressed. she kinda made me tho. she told me  it s not depression  it s just hormons. i had the same problem when your age  so don t worry. when you ll go to highschool  you ll get better. don t worry sweetheart  let me take your life for 2 days and i ll make your life shine.  i didn t believe her at the first place  because  hey  you re sad for a month and nothing really happenned that could make you feel that way  it s just hormons  cause you re a teen  don t worry  . seriously  someone would really think that  i know that i am only self diagnosed  but still  i don t really think it s just hormons. you don t cry for half of a day because of hormons  right ,2020-03-14 05:31:24
2350,i m kinda introverted and i don t have to many friends irl. my hobbies include video games drawing and deeply pondering the meaning of life i like to think i m mature for my age .some of my favourite musical artists are imagine dragons  one republic and blues sacerano.i play games on my xbox i usually play for honor   mortal kombat and fortnite  kind of cringe i know . i used to play warzone and apex a bit. the games i play most now are red dead redemption online  gta online and terraria. so if you like deep conversations gaming and music definitely message me,2021-05-18 17:43:15
4195,i set my timer on my phone so i don t get the urge to check to see if 20 min is up. i specifically have to set 20 min aside every day  for now  since i m just starting.   when i sit and do mindfulness mediation i sit on my yoga mat and will start with my eyes closed and slowly stretch my body. as i stretch i try to narrate and notice as much movement as possibly and how my muscles feel in the movement and stretch. then after doing this for a few min and trying to focus on noticing everything i then sit still and focus on how my breath feels every time i inhale. so how air feels in my nose and how it expands in my stomach. while i do this i also notice if there is a breeze on my body from the wind and how good that feels then go back to noticing my breath. then maybe notice the way the breeze feels on my skin.   is it really working if i kinda jump between noticing how things feel on my body and in my body or is mindfulness supposed to only focus on one thing at a time as to improve attention span.   if i get other thoughts about my roommate or work i immediately notice and try to refocus on the breeze or my skin or will move  stretch my body and notice how that physically feels.   is this accurate or ok specifically for mindfulness practice   idk if  jumping between  differnt things regarding how my body feels is really focusing or the opposite of focusing you know what i mean ,2021-09-11 13:43:11
42921,hey everyone. i m 21 and have been working at a grocery store in the deli. my coworkers are great i now have my own place  a motel room in a motel my grandfather owns  and i m back with what s left of my family. but going from hustling dope and ice to being addicted and homeless to now being in a normal setting has ne all fucked up. my coworkers are great and they seem to actually care about me but i cant connect with anyone. the job isnt hard but i feel embarrassed being my age and stuck. i want to go to school for hvac but i feel like i m too stupid to do it. i just want to give up. all my friends are dead or locked up including my mom. my lil brothers are going off to college in a month or so and i ll be here. i hate feeling like a loser. when i was hustling i felt so much happier. theres fucked up parts that i ve seen and shit i had to deal with  deaths raids by police seeing my mom fall out on dope dozens of times etc  but i feel like it s the only thing i m made for.   i have nobody i can really talk to. i have no friends besides my brothers. all i have are plugs and old custies tryna get shit off me. my family says theyll be hurt if i go back to it but it s just so hard trying to adapt. part of me wants to get a gun from the store i work at and just end it before all this snowballs into something worse. part of me wants to make it regardless of who i have behind me or who i really am. what the fuck do i do  what can i do  this shit doesnt get easier. and sitting around and working are keeping me stagnant. i just needed to vent. i hope everyone is doing okay.,2020-06-26 12:02:10
11932,when shopping for a candle  do not look at the names before smelling them. they use buzz words that will change the way you perceive their smell. it is like mentioning how a drink has cherry flavoring and suddenly everyone notices the cherry  even if it isn t actually cherry flavored .   also  whenever anyone smells the candle after it s in your house  the smell is not connected to the name because it is simply scenting the room. once you buy it  the name is basically instantly forgotten. so to get the most accurate smell when looking for a candle  do not look at the name before sniffing it.,2022-01-20 12:11:53

84871,it gets harder every year. it started early. my parents fighting over money every year  but dad always got the gun he wanted. yelling in the kitchen because mom was taking too long to find the bread basket. she spent the day in their bedroom  and all of us kids tried to do the same to stay out of dad s way. i remember crying while i put together my new computer desk. dad never had a good christmas after his mom died when he was a kid. every year  while we screamed in joy at the presents under the tree  he was there to remind us   when i was your age  all i got was a box of shotgun shells to put food on the table.  he was never happy at christmas  so we tried hard not to be too happy  either.  i got married young. too young. the holidays were always strange because i never quite wanted to give up what little time i had with my family to see his. we did most holidays separately. he always made it a competition. who cooked best  who had the best house  who had the most booze. christmas was a big deal for them. i never went one time in eight years. his family was so much better than him  and i hated how great he was at putting on a show for them. we were suffering. he was cheating  and i was drowning myself to keep us afloat. drowning with my own family was easier.,2020-11-28 17:53:57

2580,hey everybody so i m meditating for 2 hours a day now and i feel like sharing with you to get some advice from those who are experiencing the same things.  i enjoy meditation very much. i experience great bliss  enjoyment  and clarity out of it but just relating to the outside world has become a problem and i would like some tips and advice.  1. becoming way more sensitive compassionate and emotional. 2. sleeping 4 hours a night and can t fall back asleep 3. i don t want to talk unless i have to  and even when i do it sometimes hard for me to find words or to find an answer to that which is being said to me. 4. i feel like i don t want to do a lot of things that i liked doing  and that leaves me with a lot of empty time. 5. i eat way less and have become very skinny. 6.  since i started meditating  for some reason people are always trying to understand me and ask me questions and say i m mysterious which i do not enjoy very much as i said earlier since i started meditating i don t feel like talking that much.  those are all weird side effects that make me a totally different person. i m only 24 and to me and other people  it seems as if i m a 100 year old monk or something.   i want to know if anybody went through this   do you have any tips on how to balance out my inner state so i could be more relatable to people around me    as i used to be before meditating   how do you deal with this over sensitivity   please share your thoughts on this. thank you very much.,2021-06-14 12:40:28

170077,i feel awkward telling too much about my self but i am in middle school and my life has not felt so good over the past one or two years. about two or three years i moved from the us to sweden and all of my friends stayed at first i thought it would be ok but then i realised that everything is different and i was older so most people didn t want to hang out with the new kid and just wanted to be popular or whatever so i was kind of alone until i met a friend who  i thought i could trust so i told him all my secrets and whatever but a half a year went by and he seamed to care less and less but i didn t think much of it until it was my birthday. we had planned my birthday for a long time but during the day he just ditched me and never came back. after a while my grades got worse and my parents were shocked because i usually do well in school and i used to have a lot of friends but now it was the opposite. my sleep got worse and i got irritated at everything and my teacher and all the other students seamed to hate me. to make things worse my pet guinea pig died and that was basically the onlyone i could trust. it got harder to focus and everything just felt really bad. time passed fast and i never got time to do what i enjoy drawing and working out  i just found myself in my bed crying checking social media. and i guess i felt i wasted so much time it got worse and it just became a loop  and i never really wanted to tell anyone and i just feel like everyday tasks get so hard and i am so alone. maybe it doesnt sound so bad but i just feel like i needed to let this out,2021-09-29 11:10:58

7174,foreskin is very important. it protects the top of the penis which is very sensitive and keeps it clean. i can t imagine the discomfort of letting it touch my pants every day. all you have to do is rinse it when you have a shower. remember this is genital mutilation and you have no right to do this to your child. let them decide if they want it when they are 18.,2021-09-11 18:45:01
9081,with more people going to work for the first time in a while and leaving pets at home for many hours  you might think of getting a home camera to check on things throughout the day. instead  you can use almost any device with a camera and a video chat software to do the same thing. just set up an all day meeting and join on your devices before you leave the house. then you can join the meeting while away to see whats up throughout the day. make sure your devices are plugged in though ,2021-11-03 14:28:50

51939,i cant help but wonder if they re just being nosy or genuine. i know that people talk about me behind my back. i know they think i m dumb or annoying or whatever.   its happened before. i open up and its just fuel for gossip how i m  crazy . i cant open up anymore but i cant keep acting like things are okay for me.,2020-07-28 18:48:07
4538,as far as i understand  meditation is about training the mind to see thoughts and let them go instead of getting distracted by them. but if we get really good at this  doesn t that mean that we will no longer deal with the problems in life improve those aspects of our life which our affecting our happiness  or even plan for the future   or is meditation more about understanding better what is happening in our mind  so we can better understand which thoughts are useful and act on them and which are not useful and let those thoughts go   for instance  thoughts such as  i haven t been exercising recently  is actually a useful thought  because exercise is healthy and makes us happier and so we should make sure we are doing it regularly. but similarly  the thought  i don t like the way i look  could be an indicator that you haven t been exercising enough also and so therefore could be useful to act on.  on the other hand  a thought about something that happened in the past which we are ashamed or embarrassed of is probably not useful so we should let that go.  but i wonder if people who meditate tend to let go of thoughts much more often when actually there are certain thoughts that can and should be acted on  like the  i don t like the way i look  thought above .  eg. one of my friends recently told me that she has been ignoring the future most of her life  not planning and focusing on the present  and now she s 37 and she s worried that she s getting too old to have kids because she s still single and finding it harder to meet someone  and some of her friends have already frozen their eggs to plan for the future etc which she hasn t done and that makes her really anxious. of course she could just keep ignoring these thoughts too. but if she didn t keep ignoring thoughts about her future then she probably wouldn t be in this situation now.,2021-10-03 08:47:11

109173,while i have had sporadic depression  his has been much more constant. and i just don t know what i can do. how can i support him without losing myself  coming up on 10 years of marriage  i still adore him vehemently. looking at him makes me warm inside to this day. which i feel is a very rare thing. but his depression has been like a thorn  festering and continually worsening. he hates his job  he hates his life  and he just wants to cease to exist. i m trying damned hard to care for him  making sure all his needs are met  so all he has to do is work and come home to however he would like to best spend his time. but i m starting to resent it. because i would like to feel cared for too. i would like someone to notice i have needs that need met. he is resistant to trying meds  therapy and just about every suggestion i have. i m at a loss. i want to help him. i care and love him deeply. but i m so torn because i want to live differently... i m not even sure what i m asking i guess. maybe something i can do to help him  is there lines i should draw  idk.,2021-02-12 18:20:37
697,hi all  i ve been meditating daily for years now  and it only occurred recently to explore deeper into this experience that occurs frequently  the majority of my meditations  involving involuntary movements throughout the body  arms  legs  the neck  facial muscles  etc. moving as if to release or unearth. these are not alarming to me and never were  only seemed natural  however  to an onlooker  i m sure they would seem jarring and alarming.  does anyone have an explanation for these movements ,2021-03-09 19:44:33
149957,it s been 5 or 6 years since i had depression. i take xanax but the symptoms never seem to lighten. i m a south korean student in 12th grade  thus preparing for college. i find it pretty hard to study with my symptoms   maintaining a  average  grade not high enough for my goals but not low enough to give up.   adding up to the self hate i already have  i am becoming increasingly indifferent to lots of things. i used to be interested in quite a lot of subjects  but not anymore. even the hobbies and friends are getting out of my attention. it feels like my brain is fogged  i can t think clearly and keep zoning out.   i don t want to live my future life since it s so   not fun. i don t find a reason to live. is this because of depression or is it because i m just lazy and wasting my life ,2021-07-19 08:49:41
2093, here is an example of an active meditation   1. pick one word from the list below that describes an emotion you would like to feel more of  joy  love  happy  peace  calm  hope. 2. close your eyes and visualize the word in your head. 3. pick a color that goes with the word and visualize the word in that color. 4. fill the background with another color. 5. now  with your eyes closed and writing in your head  write the word one letter at a time. 6. as you are writing the word  say the letters quietly to yourself in your head. 7. write the colored word on the colored background over and over in your head while you say the letters quietly to yourself. 8. set a timer for 10 minutes and keep doing the exercise until the timer goes,2021-05-21 15:29:43

85827,i feel empty and guilty and hopeless  and most importantly  very very sad. my life has made absolutely no progress in the past 5 years  and i m only 24 years old. my symptoms are overwhelming and i spend my entire day distracting myself from my own mind and avoiding all of my responsibilities. i feel immense guilt for everything i put my loved ones through due to my depression. i want to die and i want to hurt myself but i know i won t because i never put anything into action  whether it s showering or cleaning my room or finding a new job or going back to school. so i ll probably keep on living in this intense torture that is my own thought process. i have no intention to change my life. i m just going to keep on suffering. i know exactly what i need to do to put change into action but i know i m going to keep on avoiding my problems and nothing is going to get better. i don t even know why i m posting this. thanks for reading.,2020-12-01 12:45:04

51107,i ve been very unsure about where i m going in life. sometimes i feel like another cog in this machine we call life. just another forgettable piece of junk. i live with my dad  i don t have a car  no job because of corona  and i m just in this loop of depression. i have student loan debts to pay off and i m just worried about my financial situation. i just feel useless to not only my family but to society as well. i try to be better everyday but i still feel like i m just a useless cog in an old machine. i want to make my family and friends proud but i just feel like i m disappointing everyone. i haven t been in a relationship in like 3 4 years. i m in this weird cycle of wanting to be in a relationship but knowing i m probably not ready for one. sometimes i go for days feeling just very  very lonely and wanting a significant other but feel like i m probably not a good partner atm because of what i m going through rn. and i don t to tell my friends this because i don t want to burden them with my constant problems. my dad doesn t really understand what i go through so it s tough to talk to him at all. i just wish i wasn t always like this. i just need to vent all this out in some shape or form before i start losing my mind.,2020-07-25 19:27:44
200420,lately my sister has not been wanting to go to school and i saw while glimpsing over her shoulder someone had taken a picture of her face and out the caption  monkey  over it on snapchat and i didn t ask her about it but i told my parents and they said  what can we do   i was kind of shocked because normally wouldn t you want to report that to school   because hello that s not okay.  i m not on good terms with my sister because she gets spoilt by my mom who didn t teach her any manners or anything but i m genuinely worried for her despite all of this. i have her schools email but i m not sure what to write and i don t want to get in trouble by my parents for  spreading our business with random people . she has also gotten into fights with girls older than her but wasnt questioners about it so my parents don t care.  my sister this morning didn t get out of bed until 20 minutes before she had to be in school. my dad got really angry and started swearing like  whichever fucker doesn t want to go to school don t send them  which made my sister even more upset. man i fucking hate my parents   i think she s depressed and i don t know what to do because she doesn t talk to me. i think school at one point got her into a counselling thing but my mom kept saying to her  you don t need it you re a good girl you re fine  and so she cancelled that with them.,2022-01-19 03:03:13

4435,my oldest friend and i are no longer talking because i called her out on her failure to be there for me like i am for her. i m basically the only friend she has  so she comes to me for everything. i m always there to pick up her calls at 2am  sit on the phone for hours to listen to her vent  give good advice etc but when it s my turn  the energy is barely reciprocated. i made a recent life change and she didn t care to check in or reach out to me until nearly a week later. her text wasn t even to see how i m doing only  she was also reaching out because she needed advice on something. as usual. that s when i got pissed and wrote her a long message basically telling her to do better or fuck off. this has been happening for such a long time but i finally had enough. it s been 7 days and she hasn t had the courtesy to respond to me. now i m 2 times more upset. how to cope  we have mutual friends and so much history that s why i m conflicted   thanks x,2021-07-28 01:52:57

2151,heres how i meditate. i sit down  close my eyes  and focus on my breathing. if my mind begins to wonder i gently redirect my focus back to my breath. ive been doing this everyday for about a week and i actually can tell that its getting less and less difficult to put more of my focus on breathing. does it have to be breath though  isnt it just supposed to be some type of focus point  so hyppthetically lets say i turned on music and made the music ky focus point instead of breathing  would that still be proper meditation  also any advice to hrlp me get deeper into it would be amazing.,2021-05-24 13:10:29
179951,hey everyone. initially nearly 3 years ago  i was put onto 50mg sertraline daily for anxiety. greatly helped my anxiety  but i had more symptoms of depression pop up. mainly feelings of great sadness  worthlessness  hopelessness and guilt for no reason. talked to my doctor a little over a month ago who diagnosed me with depression  and asked if i wanted to up my dose of sertraline  or try bupropion.   i went the route of trying bupropion xl 150mg daily. it hasn t really helped to be completely honest  in fact  some days i feel worse than before. i talked to my doctor yesterday about this  and my options are    go up to 300mg or bupropion daily  switch to a different medication  i like bupropion cause i ve already lost about 10 lbs  gained about 35 on sertraline   but honestly it has not done anything for me. what do you guys think who have been down this route before  i m honestly not sure what to do. if bupropion didn t work at 150mg will it work at 300mg  just looking for any advice.   thank you ,2021-11-03 06:15:07

8887,as someone in their mid twenties  i have a hard time conceptualizing what friendships looked like before texting  social media  etc. growing up with access to my friends 24 7 through the internet has been largely overwhelming  and i think i m having a hard time understanding how we got here and what it does to people on a larger scale.   what were friendships like before modern technology   did people largely lose contact once they left a mutual job schooling situation  how often would people talk if they did keep in touch  do you think overall anxiety about friendships and relationships increased as a result of this constant communication ,2021-11-26 13:10:38
146087,almost a year ago the company i work at shut down the building and moved everyone to working remotely. i was hesitant about it then and at this point i m just completely falling apart. my workspace is just feet from where i sleep at night  and it has to be there . i wake up in the morning next to my sleeping wife  roll out of bed  put on a pair of shorts  and clock in for the day. i don t get to see any of the friends i made at the office. i don t get to talk shit about corporate over a cup of coffee. i don t get to take a slow drive at night before i get home and destress myself before i get home.      i m spiraling into a deep depression  my work stats are falling tremendously  and my attendance is flatlining but i don t feel i have any other options. two  years ago i was a career factory worker  working with high school friends at the local cheese factory  and i loved it. but it ended suddenly when i was in a life changing car accident and shattered half of my spine. i could no longer do any sort of labor standing work and had to move to the city to find a desk job. the company i worked at was the only one who would hire a crippled factory worker with no customer service experience at the age of 20. they provided me with an orthapedic chair  a comfortable job  and secure source of income.      working in the building also gave me the social interaction i needed to make new friends here in a city i d never seen before. but then covid happened. well over half our workforce jumped on the chance to work from home rather than on site but more than a few of us wanted to remain in the office and so we did  until corporate decided for us. they decided it was no longer financially viable to keep the office building open and announced we had a month to vacate and be set up to work from our homes.  so i moved all my stuff onto a cart and shoved it into the back of my volkswagen. i got it home  put it on an old desk i had left in storage  set up some filing cabinets  and put my usual desk toys on it.      at first i was enjoying amenities readily available to me by being in my own house. i knew the bathroom would be empty anytime i needed it  i could brew my own pot of coffee  and i have shelves and a fridge with snacks and meals loaded up in them. if i got to bored i could play with my dogs or turn on the tv behind me and play my old xbox 360 on mute. but i knew it was lacking something major.     no longer could i take off my headset and go storm outside after a shitty customer encounter and vent to a coworker doing the same while sucking down 3 cigarettes in record time. i couldn t take my foam football and play catch with my cubicle neighbors anymore. i couldn t start up a conversation with my boss where we picked apart all the issues we had with  the hobbit  movies. we couldn t leave fun little surprises on each others desks  company christmas was dead forever  and we no longer would share a meal together in the cafeteria on thanksgiving.      i just finally made a single friend outside of work but i can t force myself into his space constantly  he has 2 kids and a wife to take care of first. i can t go to the gym and burn off energy because i ll physically hurt myself  i can t go wander in any direction with a .22 and hunt for small game in a city  and i can t go fishing in any of the commercial use waterways around me.      i feel so alone  i feel like i no longer have a bedroom but instead an office space that i sleep in. my physical health is being affected even  i m getting sick more often  my body hurts more than normal  and i just never feel like i m fully awake anymore.      i don t really know what help to ask for if i m being completely honest. can anyone offer some advice  or emotional support  or even share some experience that can help me through this ,2021-07-05 15:12:15
70395,life really ain t been good. it hasn t been a single bit. i ve dealt with depression for several years and i was starting to handle it  but i got into my first loving relationship. and  surprise  it didn t work. i ve been heartbroken for over 3 months  and my symptoms keep getting worse and worse. i m on anti depressants  anxiety meds  go to therapy weekly  and ive had my fun trip to the mental hospital myself. the lowest grade i ve ever got is a c  and that was one time. this year is my junior year and i have a f  2 ds  2 cs  2 ba  and 1 a. my grades are rapidly declining  and my relationships with friends and family are dying as well. i really just want to end it and don t see why i shouldn t. soon enough my symptoms are gonna get so bad that it might hurt someone else. i just want to be happy again. anyone who wants to talk let me know  anyone and everyone welcome here  lt 3,2020-10-07 22:09:25
9361,  whassup y all  for the past 2 days i have been pissed because a friend of mine made a comment to me  it was more like being interrogated more and a ways of my sexual orientation  it s because i don t have a lot of sexual history. i go to bars  parties  and the internet  but i choose not push myself into sex until the right person comes along. i really want to have a good income  and i m looking for maturity. anyway back to the topic  i was talking to someone and she suddenly ghosts me  but i haven t talked to him in a while. i had been down due to my job  and i have seen how better off they are. we had talked about that  but we talked about why i distanced myself from them  and every time i m around them they talk about how many bitches they fuck  and how much money they make and the extravagant lifestyle they have  and why i m still single  and then i was asked if i was gay and i was pissed and offended by that. that was like a cheap shot  and it s because i never was into sports  and it was my taste in music  movies  television and my choice of being to myself. i have nothing against gays but i never had no luck with females  but i do admit i am a little jealous of their lifestyles and i wish i had some kind of stability in my own life. i decided to stay to myself because of that.  ,2020-02-29 17:18:20
4465,this seems like it should be common sense  but many people assume that just because they have a job and a place to live  they re able to take on a pet. many people forget that the cheap part of pet ownership is the cost to acquire the animal. the real expenses are food  medication  boarding  maintenance  equipment  toys  vet care  and training which far exceed the cost of the animal over time. also  have everything you need set up before you acquire the animal including selecting a vet who can provide care.   these questions should force you to seriously consider whether or not you re truly ready to take on the responsibility of a pet. if your current living situation is stressful  it will most certainly be stressful for the animal. pets can be enjoyable  but they are also a major financial and time consuming responsibility.,2021-07-02 01:45:26
190621,i think to myself my life is just awful. in all my 19 years on earth i have never accomplished nothing that i m proud to say i did that. i played football for all my and never thought i d amount to anything out of it so i gave it up. i have a girlfriend for 2 years now and its sad and clear to me that she doesn t even notice my silence i can honestly say she makes sure to treat everyone except me like the main priority. nothing seems to be helping my pain  she gets all excited to do stuff with her friends but whenever i ask if we can do this or that...there s always like a hesitation. my love language is touch if someone i like even place their hand on me i ll consider that love but i dont even get that. my friends will just laugh at me if i bring it up and my girlfriend will get mad at me and push me away. life is just depressing  their is no real love in my life,2021-12-10 20:59:14

88147,yesterday was my birthday. i did the things i always did. wake up at 8am. staring at the ceiling for an hour. playing a depressing list and finally get up at noon. i dragged myself to the working table. i felt like i have to do something productive or at least get myself out the tarpit i ve been drowning for years. logged on my laptop and browed the same shit i ve done everyday  nothing changed  newsfeed has stayed exactly where it was when i been there last night. disappointed and become more of a bitter person. i went back to my bed laying to hear the neighbors fighting  wished i had someone to fight at the moment  someone would scream at my face to stir me up. i was so lonely that i couldn t remember what is a feeling  what is a person  if i was a person why didn t i have a heart to feel . i went to google and looking up for the definition  oh  what is this thing  i frowned and glue my eyes on a lost equation and bursting to laugh as if i ve been on crack. i ve found it. i got it. i might unable to feel  but i totally understand it. i am half of a person.,2020-12-08 12:00:38
153575,i m in my early 20s and am the eldest child of the family. parents are major alcoholics that have severe co morbidities like pivd and heart issues.  i find myself often having to take care of them and worrying about the future because i have 2 younger siblings. at times   i help pay the bills with the little amount of money i receive as merit scholarship. this often results in me being unable to save up money and my parents do not give me any allowance unless i m away at college. rn due to the pandemic   we re all locked at home w online classes.  this has affected me severely as i have to shoulder responsibilities and worry about the future. i ve also had depression and severe anxiety for the past 4 and 1 2 years. i should also add that my parents are both doctors. i ve spoken to both of them about my mental health. dad did not even flinch  he kept scrolling his facebook and completely ignored. mom said  you re selfish for thinking you re the only one  and mocked me for my suicidal attempts. i do acknowledge they have their own issues and try my best to offer moral support. when confronting my mom  she d say she s done everything to put me and my siblings in the best of schools and a roof above our heads. i agree  without the financial support of my parents  my sisters and i would be nowhere.   i ve battled with anxiety and depression besides an autoimmune disorder and chronic fatigue. most days  even to just brush and wash my face is a huge task but i have no option. all my energy is wasted on house chores and i have no energy left for my academic work. i have assignments that are overdue since 2 months and cannot being myself to work on them.  mom is aware of my autoimmune disorder and provides meds but the side effects wear me out. she knows this but calls me lazy for not being able to get out of bed. have taken the matter with sisters but they re far from empaths and live in their own bubble. whenever i share my feelings  all they do is text on their phones and give little responses. perhaps they re still young to understand me.  due to such factors  i ve almost failed numerous classes. having a friend who is constantly competing w me doesn t help. won t share readings when i m sick  has deliberately chosen a professor i had applied to for my thesis  deleted assignments on my laptop when we were sharing a room and i was away  dk how she even knew my password  has threatened me by taking away my kitchen knife without permission and posting it on social media  etc. boyfriend is extremely ambitious and self centered.  i have a dream of working in publishing and magazines but since i m the eldest  i am crippled with responsibilities and my parents expect me to work a safe job and contribute financially from my first paycheck. while most of my friends are having fun at parties and dining out  i am stuck at home tending to everyone s needs.  everything i used to enjoy and my hobbies i have deserted  finding no energy. every night i cry myself to sleep thinking of myself as the biggest failure.  i understand i still am extremely privileged than a lot of people and i must count my blessings. but i m scared to be stuck in this loop forever.  i m sorry for the scattered post. i had no one to talk to. if there s anyone out there feeling and going thru the same thing   i send you my love and prayer. i do my best to take it one day at a time.   i ve managed to hide away a mere 70 dollars from my scholarship  that i d saved up for the past year. hoping to start a very low budgeted online shop this year. wish me luck.,2021-08-01 08:44:22
30536,my 12yo daughter will be coming home this friday after spending a week in a psych hospital. one of her friends texted her mom a copy of my daughter s suicide note that was very specific about how and when she was going to do it. from what i can tell she has reacted really well to the therapy she s received in the hospital.   i ve put myself into therapy again to handle the crushing guilt and sense of failure that i ve been feeling since this all started. i have a lot of experience with depression and suicide ideation. i ve never been hospitalized though.   what kind of advice can you offer me  things to say not say  things to do not do  all that stuff. i m in unchartered territory here and need some help. or is this request for advice too vague or ridiculous ,2020-05-14 09:42:47
61725,just started my first year of uni and i feel so out of place. i ve always struggled with social anxiety  but it got so much worse the moment i came here. i can barely hold conversations with anyone bc of it  so everyone probably thinks i m stuck up. i get anxiety attacks every time i go to class bc i keep worrying about how other ppl are judging me. never in my life have i ever felt this isolated before. no one has ever approached me to try to talk to me. i could kill myself anytime now and no one would probably care.,2020-09-03 22:22:34

174216,for the longest of time i have actually thought of something happening to me.  as in  if i got hurt or got sick  well i would have an actual reason to take a day off  or work a bit less  be a bit self centered. i admit i would also like to get people s care and affection towards me  or more accurately i would like to have an excuse to allow myself to accept it.  for the longest of time i thought about it.  what changed  i ve been making plans.  which is a step down.   i know this is absolutely awful. that s manipulative. that s dangerous. and it s absolutely unhealthy. i know it s horrible. and i would hate it. i would even probably hide it or feel shameful about it. plus even when i get hurt or sick  i just work through the pain unless am really incapable of moving.... this way i have worked through migraines and no one would notice until i almost pass out.  the thing is i have a plan. it involves cooking. and i have trouble getting it out of my brain.  how do i get it out  how do i do so that i don t act on this desire.,2021-10-14 10:56:50

8505,sitting here admiring my classic i believe its called the jasper   north face back pack that i bought when i was in 5th grade after seeing how long my brother s lasted him. currently  i m a freshman in college. this bag has been soaked tens of times  used for everything you could possibly imagine  and it has no signs of slowing down 8 years later. my brother s is still going strong something like 15 years later.  btw  same goes for their jackets. there s a much higher chance you lose it before it deteriorates in any way lol.  yes  it may be a little pricey but you get what you pay for. lifetime warranty ,2021-10-20 10:35:06
3953,hey  guys  i just need to vent. my dad has had a couple of heart attacks before  but he s still relatively young  47 . he has heart disease and coronary artery disease  high blood pressure  and a plethora of other health problems. anyways  last night i get a text from my stepmom saying he has been rushed to the hospital via ambulance  come to find out later he s had another heart attack. i live on the other side of the country  california  while he s in georgia. i cannot afford going to see him  i can hardly afford anything right now. if i did i d fly out to there today. i feel like a failure because i can t visit my own dad. my stepmom is leaving him by himself at the hospital now because she had a plan to go visit someone today and she decided to not cancel it. i know what it s like to be in a hospital alone and i m so so sad that he s alone. and i m also afraid because i won t know anything about what s going on with him. he doesn t have much family there  but the few that he does don t really care for him. if i was in his shoes i d want my child to come visit me. it s just got me down guys. i love my dad and i m so worried and i can t do anything being this far away. have a great day guys. cherish your parents and go tell them you love them.,2020-02-13 09:13:32
10990,i ve realized this thing when some of my family members were getting me clothing from an unorganized market  for which i was grateful  but they were selling me the idea of  look  it says lux on it  it s a luxury product . luxury products are firstly expensive  so branding  5 pair of pants with lux luxe deluxe does not make it a luxury pair of pants. it s just a regular pair of pants.  disclaimer  i didn t make this post to bash the cheap products  i don t have lots of money to afford expensive stuff  but mostly i was trying to eliminate this confusion  for when i was in school  i would come to my colleagues after christmas showing my  lux  pants and i would get ridiculed for this discrepancy  of which i didn t know when i was young,2021-12-28 07:05:13
8947,lemme explain.   in my entire life i always said thanks to strangers  people that i barely know and anyone else that i don t have a stable relationship or friendship.  to all my true friends  my parents or everyone that i care i never say thanks  cause it s implied that i appreciate what they do for me  and they don t need to ear that  cause they know. they don t even thanks to me  cause i don t need to ear that.  that s what are for me healthy relations  the one where we all trust eachother and don t need to tell ear thanks anytime we do something good to eachother  cause we are always going to support eachother. i say thanks only to people that i know who need to ear that  like strangers and everyone that is not part of my life  and that s ok cause it s manners to thanks who helped you.   thanks for your attention.,2021-10-31 05:57:32
3396,i love to go out and travel but i only have one friend to do that with currently and he has mental issues and drugs issues  however  otherwise he is more than healthy enough to do long walks etc and i can drive. however  i feel like if i could throw in an incentive then my mate would be around a whole lot more. for example  i have a travel site and would love to involve him some how  but how  where i could give him a small amount of sponsor money. i d be more than happy to do that if i can increase the sponsors i get and if i could avoid him wasting it on drugs. it would also mean i could pick and choose when we went  i would think      how could that work  any ideas .,2021-06-26 15:12:53
45872,i went onto a dating site where someone was trying to play me for money when i thought they really liked me. fortunately  i didn t send her any money in the end but now i just feel bad and i don t know why. people get scammed like this all the time from what i ve read but for me  it just stung me especially when i never had a relationship before at age 23.  i m an introvert and a homebody and i don t really have many friends around. i have people to talk to  don t get me wrong but i just feel bad about myself now.,2020-07-06 16:33:48
7608,based on simple logic  and  likely  your own experience and the experiences of others that you know   this is untrue   you are much more likely to injure yourself with a sharper knife. this is not to say that you shouldn t use a sharp knife.  obviously  any knife used correctly and perfectly will not cut you. but any accidental contact with a sharp knife is more likely to harm you than a dull knife.  yes  a dull knife might require more force or may slip in circumstances where a sharp knife wouldn t. but this doesn t make them more dangerous   in general  the sharper the knife  the more likely you are to injure yourself.,2021-09-24 07:28:51

2717,i just started getting in to this world  but it s hard to figure out where to start. i m very interested in the aspect of improving focus  having adhd. among other things.   question  for you people that don t meditate very long each day  how many different exercises do you rotate between  do you do different ones each day of the week    lastly   any recommendations for good guided meditations i can try doing ,2021-06-21 19:48:03
1098,short question             i have heard that there is a way to cut out sound and noises without using headphones  but rather by meditating. how is this achieved   long question            my mother is a former primary school teacher and a very religious person at that. she taught english in japan in the early 90s and had to go through studying methods to calm students down by making them meditate. as a christian  she does not have a high opinion of meditation and believes that it is a form of evil  however  one time she decided to try out a meditation tactic that was assigned to her. the meditation was supposed to eliminate sound from her surroundings by focusing on them intently  that s all the details i have . she tried this out in a crowded and noisy environment on a japanese train on the way to work  and to her amazement  it worked. she eliminated all sound from her surroundings and was left in complete peace. at this moment  she heard a deep male voice saying  it s quiet here isn t it   this both shocked her and creeped her out at the same time  and she decided never to do it again due to its close connection to the devil.  this is the story that she told me  she wasn t the type of person to lie to her children so i m guessing she actually heard the voice. it s been year s since she told me this  and she refused to tell me anything more about it  she thought she sensed that i was interested or something i guess .  has anyone heard of this meditation style  does anyone know the steps you take to get to this state ,2021-04-05 07:58:46
7941,i m a pos. i m currently also physically sick and at home with my parents. my parents really want me to work during my break from uni. i want to but at the same time i really don t. i m too scared to even make phone calls. my social anxiety has gotten no much worse since i stopped therapy. i can do some more things but for other things my anxiety is worse. i hate applying for jobs and the rejection everytime makes me feel so fucking shitty. if i could at least work from home it would make things easier. i don t have any skills to qualify for anything. i m still a uni student. i ve been struggling with depression. i have thoughts about killing myself daily and i don t know how to ask for help. i have no friends because i distanced myself from everyone. all of this is all my fault. i m stuck in a major i hate and i can t find a job. i m so useless. i m the biggest disappointment. i can t stand looking at myself in a mirror. i try to stay distracted but nothing is fun. i m just wasting my life away doing nothing all day. i don t deserve a life. i hate uni. i hate my life. if i just killed myself it would all be over. i m scared about what will happen if i don t succeed. i don t want my parents to get angry at me or blame themselves. i wanna have a good life but i don t think i m even able to at this point. i can t stop being like this. i hate myself so much. i just want everything to stop.,2020-02-25 07:14:08
135105,hi  first time posting here.  so i m mostly here to vent and also to seek some kind of help.  i ve been working as a call center agent for over a year now  mostly because i got fired from my job  which i loved  because of covid.  the customers aren t that bad  most of the people i help are pretty kind  of course there are some exceptions because there s always gonna be someone who s mean or exhausting.  i have always been a pretty anxious and depressed person and working talking to strangers for 9 hours every day mentally exhaust me  but mostly what makes me feel worse is how much pressure i m being put on.  since i started to work there  they ve given us more duties and things to give support of  mostly tech support  so you won t always finish a call in 5 minutes  i have been on the phone with one person for 3 hours straight just to solve their problem but i almost always get positive reviews from customers.  since i take too long with some calls  they have been giving me a plan to do better in that aspect  but it s been giving me so much stress and anxiety i just cannot do it anymore  i lowkey feel like they want me to be a machine.  i struggle to get out of bed and enjoy things i like to do  i ve been taking pain meds and anti depressants. in the last 4 months i ve been to the hospital like 8 times for panic attacks and an episode of zoster that i got from all this pressure.  i can t ask for time off because of the plan i am on but i swear i just cannot take it anymore  i cry almost everyday because of this. my boss knows it s been making me sick  i swear i haven t been this sick in years.  i truly don t know what to do  i m looking for other jobs on my field but it s been pretty hard  i just want to do something i like or at least not so mentally and physically exhausting.  thanks to my partner and my family i haven t done anything bad to myself  sadly i have considered because i feel like i m trapped here.  thanks for reading my vent  if anyone has any advice i ll be glad to hear it,2021-05-27 11:34:42
4947,airports recalibrate their scales once a month  with thousands of people checking bags everyday it would not take long for those scales to become inaccurate.   i just flew and one airport weighed my bag at 48lbs and another at 54lbs. i didn t change the contents.,2021-07-14 22:23:40

4312,there has not been one action of yours that hasn t been conditioned by your environment or previous thought processes that were also conditioned by your external environment.  nothing is yours to own because there was no singular owner to begin with. every moment  as well as life as a whole  is fleeting and set on an eternal continuum.  it may be scary at first to bask in the emptiness but it is the most liberating thing you will ever get your mind to focus on throughout the course of your life.,2021-09-18 22:21:49
90147,first off  this is a throwaway account to hide. i feel so lost in the world. it s honestly weird  because at one point i felt so successful and things were going so well. i started smoking weed when i was about 16. that turned into an 8 year habit that ends today. it was always there to help  whether it was family members passing away  pets passing  ect. i can name so many things weed helped me get through along the way  but i don t want to get into dark memories. these days  i realize that weed was is my  copium.   lol  when i was 18  i met the woman i expected to spend my life with. things changed. i might sound like a pussy with this  but women can be mentally abusive in relationships and ruin someone mentally  just like men usually do. playing the victim and making me feel like the terrible person for simply hanging out with my other male friends  who were good people  its not like they were shady people who caused trouble. they were probably better people than myself.  her parents were extremely religious and sheltered her throughout her life. so  being the actual fucking moron that i am  i dropped out of college and quit baseball and got a full time job and eventually moved up to management so that we could get our own place and she could move in with me. between working 40 60 hours weekly  and trying to keep a controlling person happy  i quickly lost all my friends from high school. there is so much more i could get into  but its incredibly depressing and manipulative and i m just not willing to type all of that out and relive it. about a year ago  she cheated on me with someone she didn t even know. if you ve ever given your entire life towards making someone happy and they throw it away  you know how worthless i felt.... if you know you know. with all of that said  i feel like that catapulted my depression to unreal levels. i ve been sad on and off throughout my life  but i always had help. whether it was my parents  friends  my exs  someone was always there that i could talk to. now  i have no one. and i m lost. a few days after my relationship fell apart  i quit my job. i couldn t properly manage a team while being in the mental shape i was in. my uppers begged me to stay and take a leave of absence and even offered a paid vacation to clear my mind. i refused  and walked out. haven t been back. haven t talked to anyone from that job since. i fell into a cycle where i was smoking constantly and staying in my apartment in the dark every day. eventually  after paying rent monthly with no job  and paying my other bills  i eventually exhausted my checking and all savings accounts. my parents knew nothing. they thought i was still employed and thriving. they didn t know i quit or even lost my girlfriend. it was almost like it was embarrassing to tell people i got cheated on. my parents know now  but i still don t tell people the truth when asked. now  i live with my parents at 24 years old in my hometown  with a dead end job and no college degree. i would love to go to school  as i have a university about 20 minutes from my house  but it s almost like i m embarrassed to do that at 24 years old. i feel like a failure. i can t smile  and i talk extremely monotoned now and cannot change that. i m starting to gain weight  when all my life i was active and fit. i haven t had a haircut or shaved my face in over 6 months  which isn t a problem since i wear a neck gaiter at work  but it just shows how much of a mess my life is. i was always so social as well  and now i go to work  get fast food  and come home. if i am off  i never leave the house and usually don t even get out of bed. i feel shattered. is this how my life will be  because it sure feels like i will never accomplish anything or even genuinely have fun or be excited for anything again. my mom loves me and knows something is wrong  but doesn t press me about it. i wish she would because i m so lonely........ it s such a debilitating feeling hating yourself. i would never ever harm myself  because i have my cats that i love and they need me  they were my exs  but after her saying  i never loved you or these cats but i guess i ll take them   they are mine. i love them more than anything  however  i do wish sometimes i was dead. life feels not worth it. this is terrible  but if i had a life threatening illness  i would probably have to be forced to actually receive treatment. i m just lost. please guide me.,2020-12-13 22:24:25

9805,my life has been utter crap. all sorts of shit that is so difficult to explain to anyone has happened to me. i literally cannot picture my life being any better than it is  all i see is me become more and more ill and dead inside. the final straw was my diabetes diagnosis  i genuinely don t think i can live with a chronic illness  i am just too suicidal.   i just want to hug someone and love someone and be good at  something  but no matter how hard i try it always results in failure. i feel like i have a curse placed on me  to make me suffer and make my brain battle against itself. i am mentally and physically done  i just want out of this hell.,2020-03-01 23:07:42
170544,my interest and fascination with depression  and related psychiatric illnesses  and pharmacology is pretty intense. i spend a huge amount of my free time reading studies and other research papers. i ll listen to podcasts and videos about pharmacology while i work. i m so interested to hear about the medications someone is on when i find out they take something.  i ve practically become my sos psychiatrist and am proud that his depression is the best it s ever been because of the medication combination i suggested to him. i love discussing medication with others on reddit and am genuinely happy when i hear about a stranger s depression improving.   if i wasn t depressed when i was at university  maybe i would have had the strength to undertake such a career path. then again  without the depression  i probably wouldn t feel so strongly about the pharmacology of psych medication.   any treatment resistant people who relate to this  i know it s crazy for depression to become your passion but hopefully someone gets it.,2021-09-30 22:13:59
5351,i ve found  on several occasions  that a product that has thousands of reviews averaging 4.5 stars has drastically different reviews if you sort them chronologically.   not sure if they change the production for a higher profit margin to maximize the return on tons of positive reviews or what  but i ve noticed this quite often. especially items on buzzfeed listicles.,2021-07-25 19:59:57
119102,so i m a 24 year old female and i ve been going through a depressive episode for the last 6months. i haven t showered in two weeks  my diet consists of noodles and sweets  i ve wrecked my teeth to a point where i can t even smile anymore because it s so embarrassing but i have pretty much accepted this is just an episode which is something i ve had many times before however this time i m getting these intrusive thoughts.. i ve pictured myself hanging in every location in my home  if i m outside i look up at the trees and  wonder if the branches could hold my weight  every single time this thought comes into my brain i almost feel calmer  it s becoming a happy thought and idk what to do about.. i m a full time career and i can t take any time for myself rn so how do i snap out of this  please ,2021-03-31 17:32:12
1622,i often feel like there s a paradox in the way mindfulness is presented. as i see it  mindfulness is presented as a tool intended to either reduce stress anxiety or understand the mind better. when you intend to do one of these things  you make a judgement   that being more calm having more understanding is better than the alternative.   i don t think it s possible for us to never judge anything. we are creatures who always have some value system. paying attention cannot be done without making a judgement.  so what exactly do we do when we go into these non judgemental states  do we relax this value assigning machine as much as we can  is something else going on ,2021-05-01 00:35:10
1766,he used to text me a lot. all day everyday. he always liked my memes or roasted them when they were bad.  a few days ago i noticed his texts were becoming dry and then he stopped texting me. he still replies on messanger if i send him something but it feels like just out of kindness     and for the second day he doesn t react to the memes i send him on instagram.  does it mean he wants to let me know we re no longer friends  i feel like it would be needy to ask him what s up since a week shouldn t matter even if there were radio silence.  i have friends that i talk with every months or so. but what bugs me is the sudden change. from 100 to 0 really quick.  i can still see him engage with others on facebook and reacting to memes so its not like he s too busy...,2021-04-28 06:54:18
155483,i can see myself doing the same things over and over again.  so i can see the cycle but i can t really find the interest or motivation to change anything.     i ve been on a variety of anti depressants   currently taking duloxetine and a small dose of lithium  .     i feel like i was doing better earlier in the year when i began taking lithium.  i was hoping that the lithium was what my body was needing so i stopped the antidepressant   was taking them for a year without seeing much difference   and just continued with the lithium for a month or so.     i started taking duloxetine again over a month ago but not really positive effects.,2021-08-07 18:48:41

98179,hello friends. 27f here.   this is just a brain dump at nearly 2am because i m high and reflecting. sorry in advance.   i think my depression is getting bad again. it s been more subtle. it s not the typical  god i hate myself and everyone hates me and i suck and i wanna die  kind of episode it s been in the past.   i m just...numb.  i don t feel anything.  i m not excited about anything.  i m just existing. in autopilot. days just blur together at this point. i work and then i sit on the couch. i don t feel like talking to folks. i don t feel like doing anything. i just feel like a useless blob.   i m in therapy with a new therapist. i like her. only met her 3 or 4 times  but i like her...so far. she mentioned if i wanted to try meds again. i used to be in wellbutrin and it helped. but...i m not sure about going on meds again. i said i didn t want to anymore but i dunno. maybe i should give it another try. maybe give that another shot and try prozac like my therapist recommended if the wellbutrin fails.   i think i might. i just wanna feel things again.  wish me luck.,2021-01-06 01:45:18

6166,hello guys  and girls   i ve just started meditating for about a week now  i do it in the morning after i wake up for about 5 10 minutes and am planning to raise that to 10 20 minutes  i started off meditating by lying down and i felt immersed through the process and once i had finished my  session  i felt at peace i guess and very calm  then i saw a video showing the  optimal  position or the  right  position to meditate where you had loosely crossed legs and your hands cupped in your lap sitting down. i tried it the next few days and my meditating wasn t as blissful i couldn t sit still i kept wondering if my back was straight enough if my face was upright and adjusting accordingly. is it still beneficial for me to meditate lying down  or should i try to adjust and meet the  recommended  way.,2022-01-14 06:15:17
92833,this past week a friend got me to interact with my former friends in a place where other people i don t know can join too. sounds weird   its online voice server so some of you might not understand. anyways it also has some people that i don t really like as well.  because of the above  my anxiety has been insane. i barely eat  i m a shakey mess  i don t sleep well  i ve thrown up  and i feel like crying all the time as well as scared. as well as this i ve been extremely irritable  which has now made me feel like i can t interact with those people. i can also feel my depression now creeping back as i hate myself for how pathetic i am being  and just don t want this. i have some bad habits too which i haven t done in months but i can feel that addiction clawing back at me to do it again.  i feel in some ways i should give up and leave the group for good. but then i feel like maybe pushing myself and just making myself spend as much time as possible there will help me... i don t know what to do and i feel my friend who got me into this doesn t know what to do either. i also know that if i leave it ll upset him and i ll feel like a failure     i m terrified of losing this friend. he means everything to me because of how long i ve known him and how he s always helped sometimes when i need.  i just want a group of friends to hang with. my friend can t always play with me ofc  and it gets incredibly lonely. i just can t seem to find a group and its killing me. i feel like giving up totally atm... i can t get a job  i can t make friends  i m lonely  i can t make my friend happy  i m ruled by my anxiety  i m a shitty ass person  and best of all i get so frustrated and jealous seeing my friend and other people all talking playing together. just feels like school again... like i m invisible to everyone. i m just not good enough for anyone. i can t tell my friend all this either   i ve already frustrated the hell out of him with my anxiety. maybe its just better to be alone and accept it from now on    thanks for listening to my depresso ted talks rant. i got told writing things down helps but honestly i prefer talking things through with people. ironic when you don t have anyone to do that with because you ve already pushed everyone away.,2020-12-21 19:35:45

39209,   i ve gotten to such a low place that i don t see much of any point to continue going. my job is about to open back up  so ill have to go back to a place i hate and continue like i am totally fine. i m constantly aware that the things people post on facebook are about me and how much they dislike me or wish id leave them alone. i really don t understand why i think i m a very nice person i try to help people with any of their problems whenever i can i routinely drop what i am doing so i can assist people with their issues. i have people always vent to me about their very personal issues that include my managers  coworkers  family  friends  and others i ve had complete strangers message me that they ve seen me in the hall at school and within thirty minutes tell me their problems at home. i always listen to them and give them my attention but it doesn t seem like anyone wants to let me talk about my issues. i went to the hospital on january 21 due to wanting to end my own life i didn t because my parents and grandparents would have been devastated.  i m at a place again where i just don t want to be alive at all id love to just pick up my things and leave i m not sure where but just somewhere. i ve always been sad i don t really remember a time when i was happy there is one person who makes me so happy every time i see them but they don t feel nearly the same way it seems and that s ok its not their responsibility to reciprocate those feelings and the last thing i want is them to be held back by trying to make me feel better. it s strange feeling like you love someone even though you have never been intimate with them in a romantic way and knowing they don t view you even close to the same way. my hobbies don t bring me the enjoyment they used to now i continue with them mostly so i can et brief moments of excitement. i don t jog anymore because i don t like people seeing me run. its a terrible thing to say but if i was alone i would be happier as i wouldn t have anything to stop me from doing it and i wouldn t feel guilty about it. i just don t have any drive anymore and it seems like i m perpetually unhappy. i don t want to be alive anymore the only reason i get out of bed is that i can t sleep the whole day away every day.  i don t want to stay alive like i can promise that i don t enjoy being here day to day so i try to be as helpful to people as i can and i think that improves other people s moods. i just can t continue to be used as a venting place for people but id hate for them to feel rejected if i stopped listening that s just cruel to do i realize that if so many people do it they must feel comfortable confiding in me. i just don t understand why people feel so comfortable telling me their problems but they don t ask me mine they don t check in on me. i m just not making any meaningful connections anymore and i just don t really care anymore. my brother moved in due to a divorce and i ve more than once thought about the guns he brought into the household and how easy that would be and that s selfish and stupid but its the truth. thank you for letting me have this place to dump my thoughts and reflect i guess.,2020-06-14 03:31:50

3100, making the smallest changes can sometimes have the effect of snapping us out of autopilot and really appreciating the present moment. this is the   fourth   in a series of posts about mindfulness exercises that you can incorporate into your day.   a few times a day  especially when you feel like you need to change your state of mind  do a silly walk. for example  walking backwards  skipping or hopping on one foot. observe your mood and how it changes after you do this.  in my experience  even if i m in the middle of a very serious task  just going ahead and skipping for a few seconds or so will bring a slight smile to my face  and lighten the mood. it s almost involuntary. walking like this changes our perspective momentarily  and allows us to take things a bit more lightly.   source  how to train a wild elephant  amp  other adventures in mindfulness    https   www.wisdomblog.co silly walking   https   www.wisdomblog.co silly walking  ,2021-07-12 11:01:39

8403,assuming you use plastic bags for lining your kitchen trash can  put a couple layers of paper towel in the bottom before you put the bag in.  it will soak up any leaked liquid  and make it easier to clean up  instead of reaching your hand all the way in to the bottom to scrub and wipe out the goo. when it does get wet  just toss it  and put down a new layer.,2021-10-17 15:17:01

1877,a reminder that tissue and organ donation is not only for life saving procedures... cartilage  skin and bone grafts can improve someone s recovery and quality of life immensely.  yesterday my child received an allograft for a knee injury they recently sustained  and this will help to shorten their recovery time and greatly improve their of quality of movement after recovery. they already are dealing with jia  juvenile idiopathic arthritis   so without this she could ve been dealing with the implications of this injury for a lifetime.  we also have the opportunity to write an  optional  anonymous  letter to the donor s family  letting them know how sorry we are for their loss  but also how incredibly grateful we are for their generosity  and how much it has impacted our lives.,2021-04-22 17:34:27

4999,i feel like reality is a game. we are all pawns in the circle of life and there s no escaping it until you learn that it is indeed a trick of the mind  or better yet  a self machined chess game. we have no control over anything that happens  not even ourselves. we ve all been conditioned by others around us to feel  normal.   normal  job   normal  relationships   normal  ways of being  are the furthest thing from normal.   does anyone else feel this way or is it just me going crazy ,2021-10-31 22:47:46

4807,life pro tip   do not make major life decisions when you are feeling a strong emotion  independent of what it is . important decisions need thought and care to arrive at what you believe is the best course. you may put lots of thought  energy and care into reviewing options and coming to a reasonably good conclusion. but when the time comes to act you may be overcome with a specific emotion that makes you choose differently than you previously decided. do all that is possible to recognize these temporary defeating emotions which can misguide you and allow you to forget the reasons you came to an alternative decision. trust in your previous self s ability to analyze and make a good choice even if the emotion at hand makes you think differently.,2021-07-11 13:58:42
35324,hi    i would be grateful if anyone could give some advice or opinions on my current situation  i feel so lost. i m sure others have been in a similar situation but i don t know how to handle it or move forward.   i ve posted about this in other subreddits  but haven t received many replies and i have no friends to go to about this either. long story short  i feel absolutely miserable each and everyday and it s only getting worse.   it became too much to handle last year when i took a promotion at my last job  which i couldn t handle and ended up quitting without another job lined up. i soon got an offer for a call center a few weeks after leaving my other job and feeling pressure to not be unemployed  i took it. the thought of working at a call centre made me cringe  but the job only started in about a months time so in my head i just thought  worry about it later  it s a month away and you need a job.   i ve been there almost 5 months and i don t know how i ve lasted this long. i m a very shy  quiet  non confrontational person and i have to deal with angry people yelling at me everyday about things out of my control. even though i have no  power  or  impact  in my job  the amount of times i have to say sorry in a day makes me feel like i m a terrible person who is hurting others  not helping. we ve been very busy the past couple months  call after call for 8 hours a day. i cry all the time  even at work. when i m on a calls i hold back tears because i feel so miserable.   i would leave now and never come back but i m scared i won t be employed anywhere because i will have gaps in employment or be seen as job hopping. there s nothing i want more then to take a break and go to school to study for a career but i have no idea what i want to study and idk if i can afford it. i know i m lucky to have a job  especially now  and i know being unemployed is stressful  but this can t be normal. i m starting to fantasise about something tragic happening to me to that i can get out of work  even for a day.   how do you guys handle day to day life with depression  has it impacted your work in a significant way  how do you manage everything  i have no idea how to move forward and i feel like i have a big cloud over me.   thanks for reading,2020-05-30 17:34:23

25819,so i just thought i would put this out for you guys. i feel it is  necessary part of my recovery. i have struggled with depression and anxiety most of my life. i dropped out of 2 colleges then joined the military  i was discharged early for being mentally unwell  i was suicidal and also self harming. in the next 10 years i bummed around  place to place  country to country. i have had like 40 jobs  i became an alcoholic and abused drugs a lot in my 20s. i told lies that almost kiled me and at 27 i was hospitalised a few times  in wards with varying levels of  security.  i have had my neck in a rope more times than i can count.  by 27  i was washing dishes in a pub  an alcolholic and living at home on parents sofa. i had completely lost hope. i can t explain how deeply i had lost hope. i was literally counting down the days until i would be old enough to die.  now i am 30  and i am happy  stable and starting to move forward again  if i can recover then so can you. that is all i want to say   amp  x200b   here is the blog  it s kinda new  but i would love some feedback   https   www.notjustyet.co.uk   https   www.notjustyet.co.uk  ,2020-04-28 16:22:04

8451,you can say this in your head privately or to others   it doesn t matter. and  of course  you can take all the time you want to think of which song it would be  before you hit shuffle. ideally  i think you should get a  feel  for your next shuffle  if that makes any sense at all lol . or maybe just use it as hopeful thinking  think of the name of the next song you  want  to hear and be dazzled on that rare time when your thoughts translate directly to your device s screen. it s just a cool thing that i do that gives me fun  and maybe other people do this as well and i m not the only one lol   i posted this to life pro tips because this is a thing you have to actively work on  for it to have a chance to happen  but it s also a thing that brings you a great boon   the whimsical confidence    magic  feeling . it felt  appropriate  but if it s better suited to other subs i apologize.,2021-10-18 21:43:20

192968,i honestly don t know where to start. i am conflicted with myself if whether or not i really want to do this. in regards to sharing what i am about to share. i haven t talked to anyone about it so i guess i am hoping for an answer or just wanting it to get off my chest  perhaps both  doesn t matter  i guess i just want to gain something. i went through serious depression when i was 15 years old. i mean it was fucking bad. i have severe anxiety and i overthink everything. it was to the point where i wanted to kill myself every single day. i was tired. there would be times where i would cry in the middle of the night because i felt so alone in terms of what i was going through. there would be times where i would just get on my knees and beg god to stop all the pain that i was enduring. i just couldn t anymore with myself. i hated myself. i cursed myself for being so weak and vulnerable and not having my shit together. that s just some perspective that i could give to you. i honestly don t know how i made it through that point in my life. i am currently 16 and some of those feelings still linger. i am certainly convinced that they will never go away. i still feel worthless  weak  and a bit tired. i don t know what i want to do with my life. everybody has been asking me what i want to do. it feels suffocating. i feel immense anxiety. i recently quit my part time job because i just got tired of working. i have no motivation to do anything. i want to change myself so bad because i know what i can possibly accomplish in my life but... i just can t because i don t have the willpower to push myself. i hate myself for not having a strong mindset even though i know it s possible for myself to build one. i hate that i can t stick to things and end up just quitting because they get difficult. i long to find my purpose in life because maybe that will help me stop being so worthless. i am tired. i don t want to go back to where i was at that horrible point of time in my life. i want to be in a relationship but i don t have any self confidence and i am extremely introverted. i want to be great in life truly but i am just rotting endlessly from the inside. it s truly depressing knowing what great things that you could possibly accomplish in your life yet not having the power in order to do just that. i actually do have questions. how do you change for the better and start living the life that you want to live  how can i start being more positive  what should i do if i want to find what i want to do with my life in terms of finding a career  how can i develop self confidence  how can i be more outgoing  how can i build a strong mindset  i am desperate.   thank you if you re reading this. i just needed to vent and let it all out. i hope that this could bring some comfort to you if you re going through something similar. sorry if there were spelling errors.,2021-12-20 00:29:05
17958,hi  i know this post may be dumb or silly so i m sorry. i ve been struggling with depression anxiety and a myriad of other things for most of my life. recently i ve been feeling a lot better  this year i started exercising and ive been feeling a lot more motivated and have been working on changing my language with myself  thanks to my therapist  and i do feel really proud of myself. i used to constantly be suicidal and now if i am i ll only feel it for a day at most. i m very active and i think thats helped a lot  i was pretty much bed ridden for 6 years . if you go to my post history you can see how i stopped posting as much and it s really because i do feel better and i think i m trying my hardest to work on my mental health and physical health. i really want a nintendo switch and animal crossing new horizons. i have horrible anxiety about spending money and am trying to overcome that  i am responsible with money  ive thought about this purchase and it really is something that i want  and i do have the money to get it  but whats really stopping me is this overwhelming feeling of guilt. i feel like i don t deserve it. i feel like it s not a productive use of my time even though i want it so badly and i just feel like i don t deserve it. i struggle with low self esteem and seeing myself as valuable so essentially gifting myself something that is purely for fun recreational use seems insane to me. i do really really want it and i don t know how to get rid of this feeling. half of me is sad because i really want it and the other half of me is just saying i dont deserve it that it s not useful that it s stupid. i know it is stupid but i feel very worked up and guilty over this. i feel guilty that my mind reacts in such harsh ways over something like a video game but i can t stop beating myself up. i m posting because i could really use some words of encouragement. i really am proud of myself lately and if you knew me in person and saw the difference between me this year vs last year i think you would be too. idk i know that there s a lot of incredibly serious horrible stuff going on in the world but i do want some kind words right now. i m sorry for being self absorbed and selfish when so many things are going on i just don t really know where to turn to right now over such a minuscule thing.,2020-03-30 18:12:30
6664,try your pitch  then jump into the  catch up  part of the conversation. or even warn them that you d are going to try to pitch to them... this is so you hopefully end the conversation on a positive note. otherwise  it looks like you re attempting to monetize an old friendship  and that looks shady af. i repeat  it looks shady af.  also... even if your product  business idea  or  opportunity  is legit  be aware that you may be losing this particular friend as a consequence of trying to  sell  them. that being said  be willing to graciously accept your fate.,2021-08-29 00:38:19
117428,i m not angry but i m not calm either. there is this feeling of unease that encompasses my head and goosebumps that travel under my skin through my slim body. i want to cry but i know i can hold in long enough before i fall asleep and wake up as if nothing ever happened. then the same cycle will repeat itself. i don t try to hurt anyone but for some reason that is all i do. i can stop talking but i can t stand when nobody talks to me. i feel unwanted  unloved  not needed and just like a hovering soul waiting to be gone from this world for good. i don t see any reason to live nor any reason good enough to die. not sure how i can erase this heaviness in my head and my heart altogether. i am dependent  nothing is actually mine  not the roof over my head  not the food on the table i eat  nor the clothes on my body nor the tears in my eyes. nothing is mine. i m lost i m sad. wish i could just sleep and wake up in a different world where i can start over from the beginning. maybe even make something of myself and be happy in my own happiness. i feel like a burden on those around me and honestly many times i purposely become a burden just because i can. i m sensitive  hurt easily and  completely and utterly broken. i have a life that isn t even my own and i don t know what to do to fix it. i wish i could just communicate my feelings to someone without even speaking a word. i want someone to understand me without my having to endlessly keep trying to express myself in words that won t do any justice to explain what it is that i m going through. i have a home  i don t need to work  i have a family  i have the means to live a happy life yet i can t. i feel like there is something missing. i have everything yet nothing both at the same time. i cry so so much that my stomach starts to hurt and i feel like vomiting. i want to sleep but i just can t without thinking a trillion and a half things that make me the most insignificant thing on this planet. i don t want pity or anything else i just feel like venting.,2021-03-16 03:48:27
35009,i ve thought about ending it many times over the years  and for once i m glad that i didn t  and i understand the part of me that wouldn t allow it. finally. i ve wasted my 20 s  but that s okay. i think i ve regained a small fragment of my soul lately  however cliche that sounds. really and honestly bonding with my daughter instead of just going through the motions. she s so much like me  feels like it should ve been easy  but depression fucks with us all in unique ways.  i want you all to know that i fucking love all of you  regardless of your circumstances. we re all human beings and we all deserve to be happy. this community has helped me a lot. i m sorry i haven t reached out to anyone  this is my first post here  but i ve heard many of you. no matter how alone you feel  someone cares  even if they don t make it known. thank you all  ,2020-05-29 13:36:50

4818,so i have a close friend who claims to be my best friend that i have not seen in a few years. we talk nearly every day through text and sometimes facetime. she really likes disney world. she talks about coming to florida occasionally but i notice how every time she does it focuses on disney world and not about seeing me. i only live about an hour and a half from the orlando area.   when i bring up hanging out with her  she just says i can come to disney  if i want to  this makes me feel very unimportant to her. i would think someone who claims to be my best friend would say something more along the lines of  we gotta make a plan so we can hangout and go disney world too because i really want us to hangout     are my feelings justified  would this make you feel unimportant to someone ,2021-08-08 19:14:36

56845,depressive thoughts    on monday 6th july 2020  i returned to instagram  and since that day  i have been trying to upload as much pieces as i can  in the hopes of gaining some kind of following  but unfortunately i have not been successful with this goal  and it has brought a great toll on my mental well being.   how has it had an impact on my mental well being    how being on instagram has impacted my mental well being is that it has convinced me that in the grand scheme of everything  that my life is meaningless  i am nothing more than a voice that has entered a vast  deep  dark void.     i am like a hound that howls into the night skies  whose cries are heard by their masters  but is eventually ignored.   primarily what i am trying to illustrate with this post is that i am noone  a nobody  and no person cares what i think or have to say.   this is evedent in the amount of followers i have  and likes that my posts receives.   what can i do with the information that nothing i do matters  and everything is meaningless    nothing other than wallowing in sadness till the end of my days.   what else can i say other than that everything is meaningless  nothing matters  no one cares for what i have to say   thank you for listening to my stream of consciousness  although i doubt anyone cared enough to listen.,2020-08-16 12:09:12

139702,i suffer from adhd and ocd  medicated  and i feel like life is very good even though it has its small setbacks now and then.i have something else lurking in the shadows of my mind  which i need help to identify. because my knowledge is somewhat specific and narrow and very hard to put your finger on  so googling or asking my primary doctor is a lost cause.  the problem i have that every other year or so i get constant panic attacks  every waking minute of the day  with some kind of psychotic  psychotic in this context i mean paranoia about stuff like family members not loving me or doctors trying to hurt me even though i know it s not the case   they still overwhelm my rational thinking  episode it s like hell on earth. i can t get out of my head and everything i think of is making me scared and extremely anxious.i feel like everything i like  love or even hate is no longer of any importance. i have had these episodes 5 6 times in my lifespan and they always appear in my life in the fall or winter. i fear them more than christians fear the devil. these episodes have lasted anywhere from 1 week to 3 months.   any idea what i might be suffering from   thanks in advance ,2021-06-12 11:46:15

142195,hi i don t know how this works or anything so i ll just put a little summary out there. so i ve been wanting to die since i was 5  18 now . i m not sure if i m even depressed anymore at this rate cuz it s basically almost a permanent part of me. when i think i ve reached rock bottom  life seems to add another level to downstairs and it seems like  i m stuck in a constant cycle. if i die now i don t think anyone would really mind and my family would be better off since they can save money. people in my life also would be better off since i won t be annoying them or hurting them. i tried ending it all a couple times but i seem to not be able to do even that properly. wouldn t it be alright if just one random dude disappeared from the world  leaving everyone in their lives a little happier ,2021-06-21 15:58:52

3414,i was wondering if the infamous tm meditation is true meditation. it all doesn t make sense to me. study s have shown that meditators reduce their dnm   default mode network  which is all about grinding the monkey mind to a halt and achieving a flow state  certain nodes in the dnm also fall back into addiction   source   https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov pmc articles pmc4529365    but it seems that when someone is doing tm meditation instead of there dnm stopping it actually increases  being counterintuitive to foundation meditation practices. my question is would tm still be considered meditation because of the increase of the dnm and it being drastically different than other practices.    ,2021-07-27 09:35:37

180578,i decided i want to lose some weight and take better care of myself but i feel even worse when i try. eating actual healthy meals instead of random garbage makes me feel gross. exercising makes me feel gross. going outside makes me feel gross. interacting with people makes me feel gross. managing basic hygiene makes me feel gross. so basically everything that isnt rotting in bed all day makes me feel terrible even though it should be the opposite  i just dont really know what to do. i want it to be better but everytime i do something that should make me feel better i just end up feeling like shit and then isolating myself even more. im so fucking tired,2021-11-05 08:10:35
91531,hi  idk how to talk about this because i am absolutrly horrible at talking about my issues. but im at my breaking point. i am in 4th semester in uni and have done very good so far  only two exams from previous semesters left. although this i am doing incredibly bad now  for whatever reason. no matter how well i study i always fail by one point from pass score  but my professors are to strict to give me a pass. in total  out of the five exams i have done i have only passed 2  and i have 3 more to go and know i will fail. i have a resit exam the same date   and time  as another resit exam that i will take. there is so much more  issue is i can t give up. i dont want to quit but i also know how shitty i feel because of me failing. my life is this and nothing else  i am extremely dedicated to this and it hurts so much to fail. i  have no hobbies  no friends and no job to lean on. i had an extreme meltdown yesterday in front of my family  i am so thankful for having a supportive family but i know how sad they feel deep inside. i am tired of crying and have done that 3 days straights   is there anyone with similar situation ,2020-12-17 19:14:16

177313,i will do my best to be brief here but i would like to talk about something that has been going on for years now and i am reaching a point where i accept that something is wrong and that it is affecting my life in adverse ways.   first  some context   my life now is and has been for about 6 years now  better than it has ever been in every measurable way. i am married and have two young children and they are the absolute light of my universe. in a lot of ways it seems like my life started after marrying my spouse and us having our first kid. as a child and as a younger adult  i suffered from depression and other issues  even being hospitalized and placed in residential care for roughly a year as a teenager. since then  i have always known that there were issues with my mental health and that i had to be careful and conscientious about that because my mental state could be the driver of some pretty awful decision making. i often attempted to self medicate with alcohol and other substances  leading only to substance abuse problems in addition to the other mental health issues i was attempting to treat.   suicidal thoughts and ideations are common and recurring problems in my life. i think the first time i considered suicide as an viable option i was roughly 7 or 8 years old. in my late teens and early twenties i did seek help on my own by talking with therapists  spiritual healers  life coaches and others who claim to help with such things. none of what they said connected with my life. therapy did help though because at least i had someone who would listen to me and not judge. at least i could articulate how i felt and there was some value in that.  fast forward to today and here is what s happening   i am happier than i have ever been with my spouse and children. our little family makes me want to embrace every day and to cherish every moment of precious time with them. my heart hurts each time i leave the house for work in the morning  even though i love my job. it feels as though i am leaving them for good and i cry a lot. i especially cry a lot when thinking about my oldest child  who is 6. i reminisce about the preceding years when i was in school full time and the child and i were together pretty much all the time. my bond with this child grew incredibly strong and in many ways  the child did what drugs  therapy  and even hospitalization could not  healed me. at least it seems that way on the one hand. i must admit that i consider suicide an option much less today because i picture my spouse having to sit the children down and explain to them why they will never see me again and that i made the choice to do that to them. even so  i feel like my depression didn t go away but simply flowed into a new vessel  my family. now it is my family that is used to torment me  or more accurately  how i torment myself.every day i cry because i am obsessed with my own death and since i am agnostic  i don t believe that when i die i will get to live on. i feel like all of this love that i am feeling all of this beautiful bonding and connection between myself  my partner and our children is essentially meaningless once the first of us dies. then will begin the absolute end of it all. how i wish i could know that we would be reunited in death  i cry every day  especially at work thinking about this. i pore over the most mundane memories of the children and my partner. i cry for those moments as if they were loved ones i lost and i am grieving them. i grieve for my loved ones as if they are gone when all i did was step out for work  this obviously causes distress and over time  i believe has serious consequences for my mental health.   when you sum total it all  my life  childhood traumas and mental health issues included  you still get a very positive picture thanks to the healing that came from starting my own family. that being said  there is no denying the negative impact on my overall life and probably on my family of my having these daily tearful sessions.   does anyone else here struggle with a similar set of issues  one way that i know depression is real and not a figment of the imagination or a product of circumstances is the fact that my life is basically perfect and yet i think about killing myself almost every day. i would be interested to know what disorders might be associated with these feelings so that i can delve into some literature and try to discover more.,2021-10-25 14:40:41

53182,people say that i m a funny person  i always positive and cheerful all day but when i got to my dorm i felt all alone and empty despite my roommates were there. i crawl onto my bed  wait til the light turn off and cry myself to sleep every night  just to wake up to another tiresome day  go to school and stuff. i m not even afraid of death  i just afraid that my parent can t get over my death. i have a few close friend  but i don t want to bother them. i did join a club  but i feel like they don t care and don t want to talk to me on free time  it might be not  but the thought keep invading my head. perhaps when my parent are gone  i will follow them as well. i can t live grieving like this. i usually take a long walk on the empty street at night  because i don t give a sh t if anything happen to me.,2020-08-02 12:35:31

203270,background  26 year old male  diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and currently seeing both a couples therapist and an individual personal therapist.  i am constantly having mood swings.  i can be totally fine  and then the next minute fly off the handle on something completely irrational and ridiculous.  i am easily irritated  dumb shit sets me off and i spiral out of control.  i feel like i have literally no grip on my anger or negative emotions.  i think 4 7 days this week  i had some sort of upset or i flipped out on my girlfriend for something entirely irrational.    on the other hand  some days and parts of days i feel pretty content.  i m just cruising along  enjoying myself.  friday  for example  i had a decent day at work  went home  went rock climbing at the gym  hung out with friends and had a great day.  saturday and today  i was high strung  irritable  and felt angry at my girlfriend for almost no reason.  i treated her like shit and argued with her  was saying passive aggressive comments  and overall felt like i was going to boil over any second  and finally did.  last month  both my personal therapist and the couples therapist suggest i go on an anti depressant.  but i don t feel  depressed  as i would think of it.  i am not sad  hopeless  suicidal.  i have some good days.  i just am constantly like  fucking irate or on such a short fuse even the smallest thing could send me overboard into a spiral of anger and toxicity.  also  i am nervous on starting medicine.  i really don t want to be on an anti depressant because of the side effects some folks report.  my girlfriend has expressed that she is so unhappy with the relationship  and i don t blame her.  i am miserable some days.  miserable and miserable to be around.  any other people have similar experiences ,2022-01-30 17:30:12

88629,sometimes it feels impossible to form a coherent thought. i have a million things going through my mind at any given second but as soon as i try to focus on one thing it slips away. sometimes i just feel so spacey like i m not even there. like i m a zombie on autopilot. i just feel so out of it. i ll be in the middle of a conversation  about to reach a point  and it just slips my mind. this is nearly constant and it s so frustrating. it just feels like i m stumbling over my words trying to make a sentence that makes sense and sometimes i get there  but don t even remember wtf i was talking about or thinking. i get yelled at for forgetting to do things but i just genuinely can t think straight. i feel bad for people who try to hold a conversation with me when i m in this state  because halfway through i realize how emotionless i am. i speak monotone and flat and it s like i m so withdrawn that i have to actively make myself sound happier when i realize i m doing this. i don t want people to think they re boring me or anything. i just cant help it. it s like by the time i realize somethings happened or i ve said something  it s already in the past and it s a memory. it takes me forever to process stuff and it s incredibly aggravating. sometimes i have to just shake it off and make myself focus and snap out of it when i feel this way. is this a normal thing for depression ,2020-12-09 15:56:59

63639,well  they kind of do but they don t. you will be depressed the same amount of time but you won t get as depressed during those periods.   the underlying mental causes for the depression are still there. antidepressants just reduce the how bad it is. but they also prevent you from being really happy. just like how they curb your depression they curb pretty much every other emotion. that s why i you feel numb while on them.  and this numb feeling is fucking shit.  while on the antidepressants  if you re able to grapple and understand the causes of the depression  you can eventually work your way off of them. there s often thoughts behind your emotions. if you can understand and rationalise them out makes things easier.   i m currently reducing my dosage atm after almost killing myself just over 2 years ago. it s taken hard work and it s still a challenge day to day but  i believe you have the strength to make slow and steady progression.   tldr   antidepressants aren t a cure for depression but a tool for stability and then working on getting better,2020-09-11 07:31:34
78403,hi everyone  this is my first post here.   i m having a really bad problem  and i was wondering if anyone on here could relate. i m 21  and i m having really awful memory issues and what i would call severe  brain fog.   so  a bit of backstory first. throughout school  i was a straight a honors student. i was always very quick with learning. there were a few things i struggled with  but overall i was very good at reading  writing  math  and science.  not trying to brag  there were definitely students who were better than me  i m just trying to show the whole picture . although i never felt like a genius or anything  i usually felt fairly competent in my thinking abilities. in middle school and going into high school  i started to have issues with anxiety and depression  even being very suicidal for over a year  but most of the time i still did very well in school  excluding times that i simply didn t do the work .  thanks to my good grades and decent sat score  i got into a good university. unfortunately  i got severely depressed while there and decided to return home and take classes at my local community college until my mental health improved. however  things only got worse from there. i started to show signs of ocd  which was very debilitating for a few years. since then and since being out of high school  i ve been noticing what feels like a decline in my mental abilities.  i continue to get as in my college courses somehow  but i can t remember anything i ve learned after i ve done it. i can t seem to focus for the life of me  and i keep getting confused over really simple things. it s been getting especially bad these past couple of weeks  when  coincidentally or not  i ve also been feeling depressed and suicidal for the first time in a while. while i used to consider myself a really good writer  not the best or anything  but definitely good   i now struggle with simple grammar  forget the meanings of words or lose the word i m trying to think of  and i can t follow my train of thought at   all.   i m not even completely sure i m making sense right now  although i am trying to. these are things i definitely didn t struggle with in the past  and it s extremely difficult for me to deal with this because writing is the one thing that i felt like i was really good at. i ve also been struggling with following conversations  movies  and jokes  all of which make me feel extremely stupid.  now  i m not really sure what s going on here. part of me thinks that i ve maybe always been really dumb  since i can think back to times in my life when i didn t get jokes or i struggled with puzzles or things that i felt like i should ve understood. however  i distinctly feel that something is   wrong   in my head. ever since i started getting depressed  i have had some amount of brain fog and memory issues  but i really feel like it s getting worse. it has destroyed my self esteem  especially since i always felt like i was reasonably smart  and i ve always wanted to pursue higher education  and i really don t think i can in this state. i don t really have any skills other than doing well in school  so i have no idea what i would do if i stop being able to perform well in academics.  i don t know if any of this makes any sense  or if anyone can relate to this at all. i probably sound extremely dumb right now  because i can t concentrate for more than a few seconds  and i am feeling especially  foggy  in my head. i m just   really   looking for advice. i ve been too ashamed to admit any of this to my parents  who i live with right now   because i m really afraid they re going to realize how stupid i am.   i really don t know if any of this makes sense  but if it does  i could really use some advice. sorry this is so long  and thank you if you took the time to read it.,2020-11-09 19:30:17
13524,i ve struggled with my depression since i was 12  i m 19 now  but recently it s been really weighing on me to the point where i was barely taking care of myself. i made it to 2 of my 10 classes last week  and i didn t want to be alone with my thoughts so i was high all the time from thursday to saturday. for the month  longer  my memory is shitty lol  prior to that i was smoking weed at least twice a day. i didn t want to be skipping class and getting high all the time  i actually love my classes  but it felt like i couldn t do anything else. over the weekend  i had a bit of a mental breakdown which resulted in me crying nonstop for multiple days  i usually never cry  and i ended up calling my parents for support. i felt really bad about making my dad fly out to my university  but his support has really been helping me. my friends and girlfriend have also been incredibly supportive. i ve signed up with my university s counseling and disability services  so if i have another episode i will have a bit of a safety net. i only missed 4 classes this week  and 2 were on monday when i was still having my mental breakdown. i m working on getting a therapist. today i managed to get out of bed without someone telling me to  i am terrified of disappointing people so i leverage that to get myself to do things lol  and i walked to my morning class  i was able to pay attention to the songbirds because i left early enough that i didn t need to rush. it feels really good. hopefully i can keep this momentum going and be ready to return and work hard next semester ,2020-03-13 13:51:20

94744,my life doesn t provide any joy as it is  and it is only going to get worse from here. the future for me is just working a job i hate. work  come home and distract yourself from the awful reality  sleep  repeat. the only thing i want is for all of this to stop. i don t have hobbies and i m not mentally fit nor interested in having relationships with people anymore. the few interests i do have just serve as ways to keep my brain occupied  they re not things i m actually interested in. if i kill myself now the only thing i d be missing out on is working  getting old  and then dying as a senile man in diapers. suicide seems like the logical thing to do  i ll give it a few months though just in case. i m posting mainly to try reducing pain by venting and because maybe someone can offer me an argument against my train of thought.,2020-12-27 17:21:36
10460,good morning it looks like it s gonna rain all day in socal. the good thing about rain is it covers up all your tears. i hope you are able to stay dry and warm. but if you feel like crying go outside and no one will notice.  the last time it rained i noticed i had a rain leak in the roof of my car. the leak was causing water to drip from the front passenger grab handle. i knew i wanted to fix this before the next time it rained. i ended up waiting to the very very last minute because procrastination don t judge me.  so last night at 7 30pm i bought a can of flex seal clear at an auto parts store. the stuff says it is liquid rubber in a can but don t use it on your private parts. trust me it doesn t work i tried and now my wife is giving birth to twins. on the can it says it s excellent for roof leaks and that s exactly why i need it.  the weather forecast said it was going to rain at 9pm last night so i didn t have much time. i wiped clean the spot on my roof i thought was the cause of the leak and i sprayed flex seal clear over the area.   fast forward to today. i m sitting in my car writing this while drinking a large venti green tea chai tea latte latte from starbucks bucks. it is pouring rain outside and the rain leak in my car is completely gone. i m so happy i want to cry tears of joy but i haven t cried in years cause i m completely dead inside. thanks pandemic  have a great day ,2021-12-14 13:35:17

3727,step 1  take small index cards  3x5 inch or so  and cut them in half   step 2  write a concept term etc. on one side  and write the solution definition etc. on the reverse  try to make them reversible  so that even if you flip the cards over  you can guess the term or concept based on the definition or solution    step 3  take all of your cards and shuffle them so you have some that are definition side up and others concept side up   step 4  go through your entire stack of cards and quiz yourself. the most important part here is to separate your cards into piles depending on how easily you answered them. for example  if the card was easy and you immediately knew the answer  that goes in the green pile. if you weren t immediately sure or were sort of correct  that would go in the middle or yellow pile. if you didn t know or got the answer entirely wrong  that card goes in the red pile.   step 5  you can probably eliminate the cards in the green pile  because you know them well enough. so take the cards from the yellow and red pile and reshuffle them  and continue quizzing yourself  using the same procedure as before  green   i know this  yellow   i kinda know this  red   i don t know or got it wrong    step 6  continue repeating until you ve got no more  yellow  or  red  cards. you can even take your cards and reshuffle them  back to front  etc  to vary continue practicing your cards in the opposite direction.     the point is to start off by making your cards useful enough to actually help you memorize the important concepts. once you ve done that  the separation into green  yellow  and red piles  and continuously discarding cards in your  green  pile  helps you focus on things you don t actually know  rather than wasting time going over stuff you are familiar with.,2021-06-10 12:47:21
33643,everyday i m feeling pressure to be continuously happy  but how can i feel this way when all you do is sit there laughing. i overthink these situations  like how to talk and how to act right  cause when i show you my true colors you just judge and then we start to fight. now i think that you re just bitter cause of what you think i put you through  so even though the truth will kill me i ll lay down my crown and sign my tomb.,2020-05-24 22:39:56
98825,i feel really tired of pretending that everything is fine with me. every time they ask me how i m feeling  i obviously say that i m fine  but i wish i could say no and people cared about it. everyday feels like one more step in the going down stairs of a dark enviroment. and every time somehow i reach hapiness something terrible and horrible that makes me suffer happens. sometimes i feel like something just doesn t want me to be happy. and i am a science man  i am fully aware that i am nothing more than a complex grouping of cells each made up of trillions of elementary particles and quantum fields  that my thoughts are only electrons that travel across neurons and axons. but i still feel like shit. i don t even know why i m writing this  nobody cares and i know that very well. i ll go back to crying against a pillow.,2021-01-07 22:43:41

1386,trying to identify a thought during meditation is a thought within itself. the more i try to think of identifying thoughts  i realize i am no longer meditating but thinking of thinking. there comes moments of bliss through out my meditation which i now realize occur when no thought or act of thinking is taking place. it s truly paradoxical when you think about it...,2021-04-21 00:54:00

3272,before i started learning about meditation i would hear about it and think  i could never be one of those people. how do they just  clear their heads  like that  my mind never shuts up   i ve heard the same thing from lots of other people.  i understand now that it s really not about clearing your head at all  in fact it s kind of the opposite    but i find it interesting that so many people think that. i don t remember anyone specifically telling me that  it just seems to be the colloquial understanding of what meditation is. does anyone have theories on why that is ,2021-07-20 17:38:37

169146,hello  im kind of nervous about posting here but i just want to get this off my chest.  ive kind of grew tired of waking up everyday just to feel like i have to act my  personality  whenever im around people. people know me for being bubbly and as a happy person but if they only knew what was going on in my head im sure that they would be surprised. i think about not existing in an almost everyday basis. the funny thing is that i don t even want to die  im actually scared of dying which is really ironic. it s just like i just want to disappear  no traces left  people forgetting about me  etc. growing up in an asian household  mental health doesn t exist  ive tried talking to my parents about getting therapy but they always just shut me down and always tells me that i shouldn t be depressed because i have a house  food to eat  and a family that isn t broken.   im just tired of just feeling like i m not enough and that i m not doing enough. the things i want to do isn t  right   i don t even know what i want to do in my life. the constant anxiety of not being enough  not doing enough  not being smart enough  not being this cookie cutter perfect of a person is eating me alive. im constantly compared to people   why can t you be your sister when she was your age she always studied hard.  if it s not my sister it s another person s child. i try my best on everything i just can t help that i m not an a and b student but rather a c and d student. college isn t helping me either  college is so difficult for me it feels like i can t do anything right  ive given up on it. im currently on academic probation for having such a shit gpa  my father doesn t even know that im on academic probation and im scared that if he finds out im going to be called a useless dumb child.   im not skinniest person either  im rather on the chubbier side and everyday im constantly reminded that im fat. my mother supports my shit eating habits  whenever i tell her that i skipped eating that day she always tells me that its a good thing so i could shed a few pounds. i developed a habit of eating just one meal a day or sometimes i skip eating for two or three days  only drinking water. at the same time i also sometimes binge eat because it became my comfort thing to do whenever i feel like shit. everytime i go on social media sites i sometimes just stare at the post of a person and thinking  what is it like to have a body like that  i know that i could work on myself but it s difficult for me. i have difficulties shedding weight and i always lose motivation fairly quickly.   i also don t have a set direction in life  i don t know what to do  whenever i earn money i spend it on things that i don t need. i also started smoking weed just to make myself feel like i m not here and to numb everything that happened on that day. i also started cutting again  it s the only thing that grounds me whenever i have a depressive episode. manic episodes and depressive episodes are taking a toll on me.   i m just tired... i don t know anymore... if you re reading this i thank you  thank you for taking the time to read this.,2021-09-26 04:25:33
2595,   i  was reading  the mind illuminated  and have found a para that helped me  be more in the present and reduce the background chatter atleast by  half. i m more present now. i have been reducing the background chatter  since days now and it feels so relieving.  the  summary is   change your relationship with mindwandering background  chatter   if you find yourself not in the present  you are  wandering daydreaming mindvoice  do not curse yourself for not being  mindful. make that your  aha  moment. you found your mind wandering or  creating chatter  you found it  you pat yourself on the back  bring your  attention back. that s it. do not be hard on yourself for being  away   because that s very very natural and occurs to every one. if you are  disappointed that you aren t  present   the results would be detrimental  as you would feel sad and unmotivated to even try the next time .  this changed the way i deal with the  things  in my mind and it began helping me in ways.   hope this helps you too.,2021-06-15 03:19:50

9288,this came from watching gladwell. weed out classes have the same fail rate generally regardless of school. 2 3 people fail regardless if it is some tiny school in the middle of nowhere to mit. the thing is that the student body at all of those schools aren t the same. the dumbest kid in mit could have still be near the top of his high school class and could be the top student in a less prestigious school. yet  mit has the same drop out rate from stem as some random school no one has heard of. those students who failed in stem at mit could have easily succeeded in a lower ranked school.,2021-11-09 11:51:01

50300,i work in commission based industry. no base income. commission only. covid has wreaked havoc on my business. i wish that was the only reason my business suffers. year 1. pregnant. great year. year 2 severe post partum depression. i thought my baby would die in his sleep every single night for the first 5 months. i thought his gifts were poisoned. it was hell on earth for me. year 3 covid. fuck. i keep telling myself how worthless i am and the only thing good i have done is my beautiful child. i cannot kick this feeling of being worthless  being stupid  not worthy of love. then i feel the smallest glimpse of hope. i hate myself for feeling any sense of pity for my life. i need to treat myself better because i think i may deserve it but suffering is my baseline. i want my dark cloud to carry on and let me be.   this post feels insanely selfish. i haven t even hit post and i already regret it.  resources welcome. i know i m thinking like a sick person on a rational level. but the self hate is very strong.,2020-07-22 14:02:56
817,i started meditating consistently about 5 months ago as a way of dealing with depression and anxiety and it has worked very well for me. i by no means am an expert but the practice has helped. though as i continue to feel better day by day i find meditation becomes harder an harder. i have less motivation to practice and i feel more unfocused during my sessions. it also seems to take longer sessions to really feel the effects afterwords. i ve tried varying the type of meditation i practice but nothing seems to stick. it feels like the happier i am the worse i get at meditating.,2021-03-14 11:29:56
153501,roughly a year ago i started taking a more  proper  dosage to help deal with my depression  and for a while it did work well in a way of limiting emotions and stuff. hell i think i was on an upswing up until yesterday where it all came crashing down again. for the first time ever really i just got black out drunk  with a group of people and honestly i made excuses for the people i loved when in reality i just can t deal with finding a fault in them. as someone who s recently come to understand that sexuality and all that fun stuff isn t black and white and is more of a grey ish area ive fallen in love with quite a few people. all of whom either hurt me  left me or just never felt the same. two of the last people i love just started dating and both made it clear they don t feel the same about me as i do them  i m happy for them but at the same time i feel incredibly hurt. all i ve wanted is to feel that someone who i love truly loves me back the same way and just knowing that no one i love does hurts a lot. yet i keep going out with them and hanging out with them which only hurts me more. not gonna hurt myself been there done that  and i feel like my only option is to get over it or cut them off. i really don t feel like doing either. so random people on the internet who know very little of the entire context what do you think i should do. and to the like three people  if that   that respond thanks,2021-08-01 00:47:17

105630,hello ladys and gents of reddit  its time for another teenager to share there story. i m gonna say right now my life isn t that hard  i m a 16m with a possible future in manufacturing who grew up in a well supported middle class house hold.   ever since early 2017 i ve just haven t been the same and i ve been fighting that battle for years at this point. my best friend died in march of said year so that s what i belive to have kicked this off. then late 2018 i was almost hit with a sexual assault charge or something of the type. that caused me to be the most hated in what seems like a 15 town radius. that caused all of my friends to leave which i understand which lead me down deeper. i started to juul  once i couldn t get a head high anymore i started to steal cigarettes from my parents so i could be relieved of anything.   i became addicted and fast. i always chased that fucking head high and relief. it got so bad that i had to tell my parents because it started to fuck up my ability to play baseball which was the only think keeping me from losing sanity. point of that little tangent is dont smoke  it blows. anyways i lost practically all friends and then high school rolled around  i left my towns school to go to a tech school which i thought would change things but boy oh boy was i wrong.  i actually started to make friends  live a normal life and actually enjoy high school  hell i made varsity as a freshman  everything was going great until early sophomore year. someone had found out the aforementioned sexual assault thing and that causes almost the same effect as it did in my middle school. now its junior year and i am still as empty as i have felt before. i have a small friend group of like 4 guys and im the punching bag of the group but it feels good to be actually talked to.  i ve tried everything from therapy to antidepressants but nothing seems to work. i just dont know what to do anymore.   i know my story isn t as bad as others on here but if you made it to here i would like to thank you for taking the time out of your day to read a stranger s post on reddit. leave something in the comments if you like  umm have a great day,2021-01-29 00:17:20

146298,i m diagnosed with depression  2016   i m in therapy for it  and currently struggle with a couple symptoms of depression that freak me out because i don t feel depressed and or sad. i have anxiety as well. my symptoms are fatigue and dizziness basically constantly. my blood is fine tho. i was wondering if it s normal to experience symptoms when you don t actively feel depressed  stressed or sad. it s been like this for me for a couple months to a year now.,2021-07-06 04:35:53
11137,my mom had a talk with me about how if it wasnt for me she would give up. now suicide is off the table  but what the fuck is on the table then  living through this hell  where i cant concentrate because i have intrusive thoughts so bad  i need something to take my mind off of the thoughts. and my parents tell me im not allowed to tell a doctor  because the intrusive thoughts could endanger my planned out medical career. life has become too much to bear and i cant take it. ive become so stressed my eye has started to twitch almost every time i blink. i cant escape  and not even suicide is an answer anymore. it doesnt help that it feels like everyone god damn hates me. any mistake i make  i always have a thought like  wow  that person probably hates me now  and i cant live with my own thoughts. when ever i dont have a distraction  my mind starts saying violent stuff i dint agree with  but it says it in my voice  making me think im fucking crazy. maybe i am fucking crazy. id prefer no one knew me  so no one would miss me once im gone. please  someone help.,2020-03-05 22:08:22

103509,i wish i didn t hate myself so much. it s easy to say  just set goals    forgive yourself  and  think positive  but none of that means anything because none of that changes what has happened. i m stupid and low value because i failed in everything  school  work  relationships  health  experiences  general life situation   did horrible things  never stood up for myself in the face of abuse and public humiliation  and my essence is rotten. i m a dumb person born to a dumb family with dumb beliefs and an immature outlook.  i have countless and unbearable memories of awful things i ve done  things that happened to me  and things i didn t put an end to. multiple times throughout the day i physically convulse at the recollection of these events.  i m one person in billions and i don t matter. my life doesn t matter. i will suffer alone and in silence for years until i die and my life won t mean anything. i m a negative depressive with nothing to offer  nothing desirable to contribute to society or any social romantic situation.  i can t change because the foundation of my life and self is rotten. i was not raised right  i did not develop right  and i have nothing to build on. i have lost the most valuable years of my life and more importantly i lost what little will to live i had. i don t care how young anyone thinks i am. i have missed my window to make my life worthwhile. i have absolutely and undeniably zero desire to live  confidence in myself  and self worth. there is little to no chance of anything developing into a life i deem worthwhile.  i will always be alone because of my unworthiness and the low quality of the family i was born to. i will always be paid poorly because i am too stupid to do well in academics and i have a very poor relationship with school.  it doesn t matter what  goals  i set. i dream of ending my life and finally being relieved of this suffering enough to enter into absolute nothingness. there is nothing in this life for me. i don t enjoy nature  i don t enjoy music  i don t enjoy being in public or around people  i don t believe i am worthy of travel or romance.  i wish there were a way to erase all memory of me and jump off a tall bridge into the abyss.,2021-01-21 19:25:32

192955,my sister is depressed. she doesn t feel she has any reason to live anymore. she nearly drove to the er the other night because she felt her suicidal thoughts were spiraling out of control.  i want her here with me. she thinks that i  alone  am enough to live for but she s still living with a lot of pain.  she told me how i can help her  she wants me to support her on removing our mother from her life . that s something i can help with.  but i m still scared she ll harm herself. the only qualified person i know  that s actually met her and understands her history  is her former therapist.    would i be stepping out of my bounds if i emailed the therapist and told her what s going on    i need some guidance with how to deal with my sister.    how can i support my sister       what should i say       what should i      not      say       what kind of professional can i speak with and get guidance from about dealing with my sister   ,2021-12-19 23:43:37
8862,i live in a forest  not near a forest  in a forest  and i have learned over the years that most trees will just drip as much water as they stop after the first five or ten minutes  but a thick pine or fir tree can stay bone dry around the trunk for a solid hour. just push your way through the lower branches  which are wonderfully bendy  and hunker as close to the trunk as you can and you d swear you re inside. as a bonus  you ll be left smelling christmassy.,2021-10-28 12:48:07
41033,on two accounts i ve been told that i made people i personally uncomfortable due me talking to them about sexual stuff. i was at a really low point and them saying i harassed them really hurt my feelings. i made sure i apologized profoundly and told them that they never would have to see and hear from me again. i do now know better but i broke my 1 rule of treating others the way i want to be treated. i feel like my horniness gets the best of me and i m just absolutely disgusted beyond disbelief. the people who told me that i shouldn t kill myself and that i should get help. even when i m getting help  i still am haunted by how i talked to those people  even though i asked if it was ok and said i was really sorry. this place is the only place that i can talk to about this situation. i m a good person i swear but i just can t do it anymore i m at my breaking point i can t take it anymore i just can t. i m on the verge of crying i know it was a mistake to talk to girls like that and i didn t mean to make them uncomfortable i swear on my life i don t deserve to live i swear i just complimenting her most of the time i m so sorry i don t deserve to live. i highly doubt they think i m a good person.,2020-06-19 22:29:01
1598,lpt  if your stomach is not agreeing with something and you could vomit  vomit. your stomach is probably right. this is true with food and or alcohol. your body is giving you a sign that what you just ingested is not gonna be good. it s not a sign of weakness to vomit.   i m not saying that vomiting is good for you  and i m not saying to become bulimic.,2021-04-14 23:10:15
8166,use a small needle and     carefully     clean out your speakers and charging port. you d be amazed at what gets stuck in there and how quickly it builds up.   so many times  my family and friends have spoken about getting a new phone because the speakers aren t as loud as they used to be or their phone just isn t charging properly at all. have you ever heard  i have to put the cable in a certain way otherwise it doesn t work    all i do is grab a needle and clean the ports out for them and the phones are back to normal and my friends are always shocked at how much of a difference it made   saving them a few hundred quid in the process.  most phones can easily get blocked up when gathering the dust from your pocket and natural oils from your hands so always bear this in mind.,2021-10-11 09:47:20
75140,i dont want to feel this way anymore. i m sick of the overwhelming dread and anxiety and the anger. why can t i just feel okay  i m fucked up everyday and i feel stuck. i m so fucking tired and fatigue  i have no appetite and i can t fucking focus  why should i not kill myself already  ,2020-10-26 21:27:36

158689,i m sorry if anyone reads this so don t mind me please. i don t want to bother anyone i know with this so i guess i m just writing it here. i m about to be 21 and i ve never been worse in my life really. i know i was happy once when i was a kid  but i really just can t even comprehend what it s like to be happy anymore. i ve always been alone. i m working through very difficult classes to major in something i don t even know if i want to major in. i can t really sleep that well at night and haven t for a long time. all i think about is what a failure i am and how i wish i never made it this far and died already. all i really want is just someone to be with but i know that won t happen because i don t deserve it. i m tired of people stabbing me in the back. it s just been an endless cycle of bad things happening to me for years on end now with barely anything making it worth it. frankly i m just tired of living. it feels more like i m just surviving than living. if things keep going how they are for another couple years  i know with 100  certainty i ll end it. i ve managed to put off ending it by either cutting or burning myself every so often  since for whatever fucked up reason in my head  it seems to help. i know life isn t fair but it s certainly hell bent to fuck me over regularly. anyways i guess that s enough complaining from me. i m sorry,2021-08-18 23:27:17

4150,it reminds me of all the mistakes i ve done in previous  relationships . i ruined everything with my ex after a year with the most retarded way  i got played by an fwb so after she found a boyfriend she got rid of me  and now i had this girl that had a  crush  on me  as she said  we did a lot of  stuff  together  and she had a boyfriend  an abusive one at that. she chose him over me  and after a fiasco of a conversation where she started crying and apologizing to me for not  picking the ideal one  she decided that it s best to stop talking  to go on a  break . we have been in the said break for more than a month  i think. the sheer thought that she s with him in this day is killing me inside  and all i can do about it is sit here on this pc and do nothing but bitch to the 1 2 friends that i have left.      fuck valentine s day.,2020-02-13 22:30:50

7602,hello everyone  how s it going      today i have a challenge  to write a technical report as part of an assignment. writing reports is probably my least favourite thing to do as part of my course  but apparently  we have to do it.  as much as i want to delay it and not do it  i kinda can t as it s due this week    while i am writing this awful thing  i would love to have some people to chat with  to help keep me sane and on track  . i feel like i am fighting to keep hold of all of my last few brain cells  a fight that may not be going my way  . but  i shall persist and by the end of it  my brain shall be mush.  if you are interested in preserving my brain cells  we can talk about anything you like  i can even bore you to tears with fun concepts like http and html  . i like meeting all kinds of people. so everyone is welcome to come and say hello. i don t judge people  just be nice to me and i ll be nice to you.  if you wanna chat  send me some info about yourself and a conversation starter.    quick facts about me.    i am 26  almost 27      i live in australia  brisbane  but i was born in the uk      been here 10 years now  as of july       i am a dual citizen of australia and also the uk.  yay  more passports     i am currently in the last few weeks of study for a diploma of software development  hence the annoying reports       the goal is to become a programmer and developer. i am currently learning c   java and sql.   my hobbies include       pc gaming  reading  watching youtube twitch and all those fun things      currently  a little bit addicted to new world  oops .      but  i am also looking forward to farming simulator 2022  don t judge me alright      big lover of sci fi  star trek  star wars and i am currently watching doctor who again.   i have a super cute doggo   she is 4 and a german shepherd  have a great day all   ,2021-10-24 21:28:52
77145,throwaway account  i have a few friends subbed to my main account and i don t want them to see this post as mine. i read a post on here that was like  staying alive to not make others sad seems pointless  or something. and it felt so accurate that i kinda smiled.     anyway  so a bit about myself. i study a subject i love  have a future ahead of me and i have many friends that care deeply about me and vice versa. i feel like shit because i m sad about things that i feel like i shouldn t be sad about. i feel like shit because i have the feeling that i m not as depressed as i sometimes think i pretend to be. i feel like shit because i have everything in my life that i need to be happy  but i am just not. i consider myself to be the most pathetic person i know  and i feel like deserve nothing i got. i don t think i deserve to call myself depressed  because there s people that objectively have it an infinite amount of times worse than me. and sometimes i feel like the only thing that s stopping me from going the last step  is that me and my mother have been there for each other since my parents got divorced and my autistic sister got put into daycare because she and my mother might legitimately have killed each other if someone hadn t intervened. and now  after everything my mom did for me  and also my sister  don t get me wrong  she loves her dearly  i feel obligated to at least outlive my mother. and even during the times where i feel better  there s always this lingering thought in my head  ever since the first time i considered  that i might just be alive for my mother and i am afraid for what s going to happen if she s gone.      another thing that s been on my mind recently  is something that someone once told me.  if you didn t attempt to commit suicide at least once  you don t deserve to call yourself depressed.  the person who said this is a diagnosed sociopath who s been under medical observation for most of his adult life  and i am deeply disgusted by this sentence. but i am also thinking   maybe then i could finally feel bad about myself          don t pay to much attention to this  i m not even sure i ll check in on this post ever again  but i felt like i had to get my thoughts out somewhere  because i don t want to bother my friends. i ll try and go do something productive now. i have a test tomorrow and the manner and place articulation of english consonants don t study themselves.,2020-11-03 12:19:59
7337,i sat here for over an hour typing up a post about my depression and how things are just going downhill. i was all set to hit that post button  but had to read it over. after doing so i some how convinced myself that in a bigger perspective i m doing ok. there are far more out there worse off than me. i m going to keep moving forward. little victories a day.,2020-02-23 14:17:33
172293,right now i m looking to my little garden. mid day  sun  typical warm in this period of year  fall. a gentle breeze in the air. the bees getting nectar from my flowered rosemary  the butterflies flying around  and the birds singing in the background. so peaceful. sometimes i wish i could be a part of that  not only seeing  being. right now i m watching a little bird that wants food from my garden but it s a little suspicious of me. everything so serene  makes me want to be here forever. i feel so relaxed.  have to go to work. i like my job  but being thrown like that to society and life again everyday  makes me so sad and depressed. i wish i could choose.,2021-10-07 09:43:25
82695,sorry if this is wrong sub for this  but long story short  im a minor so i still live with my parents. i ve been dealing with quite a lot of shitty things this past month and my life is basically falling apart. i fell into a very deep depressive episode so i can t help but sleep 16 hours a day  barely eat and barely have the energy to talk to anyone etc etc because it just feels so draining. i wish i can do something about this but i cannot because i no longer have access to therapy. thus  my mom complains about me sleeping all the time aka what she calls it  being lazy . i physically and mentally cannot for the life of me get out of bed every morning. shes been calling me names for being in my room all day such as  autistic  which is extremely fucked up. i can t tell her i m just going through personal stuff because she isn t very educated on mental illness and will just tell me to  suck it up .  i m not very close with her so she doesn t know much about my personal  amp  social life . this is causing a lot of problems  i m 17 and she took my phone because of this. it sucks so bad because i just need a damn break and shes just making everything worse  yelling at me everyday and calling me names. she thinks shes being a good mom by forcing me to stay out of my room when in fact she really isn t close to being one.,2020-11-22 09:26:26
195135,sorry in advance for the long passage. below are my life problems that i am trying to navigate through. i feel stuck and would appreciate some advice.  i am a 30 year old female icu nurse in australia who grew up in a low socio economic background. i have wanted to become a doctor since i was 14 years old. my parents were poor. i didn t ask for the 1000s of dollars of prep courses to try and get into medicine. my early 20s were full of low paid jobs whilst completing my bachelors and honours degrees. then i took up nursing as a way to sustain myself. i have been working as a nurse for 4 years. next year  i could do a low cost  one year  post grad course in critical care nursing which wouldn t increase my pay because i already have a masters degree. but it would ensure job security in case i don t get in medicine. alternatively  i could finally quit working full time and study for the medical admissions test here and try to get into med school. over the last few years  i have saved enough money to fund a medical degree and its associated living costs.   background  my family doesn t live with me but lives in nz. my parents are old  my dad is retired and my mother will retire in a year s time. they have recently bought an apartment for themselves. my brother is unemployed at the moment and has depression. my sister is employed  in her late 30s and alone. at this rate it seems like none of us will marry and have kids. i don t know what to do to help them. i worry about them and have thought about splitting the money i saved to help them buy a house. i encourage them to move from nz because the cost of living is low here. they are interested in doing so but have yet to apply for jobs here.   i need help figuring out what to do next year. should i quit and work with an agency next year essentially reducing my hours so that i can study for gamsat  or should i complete this post grad  and then quit ,2021-12-29 12:48:29

4779,just for context  i got eye floaters.  i was like 10 15 minutes deep into my session and out of no where my vision became clearer. and i didn t know where my arms were at  but it felt extremely peaceful even though it only lasted about 5 or so seconds. it was nice and i m grateful that i was able to experience such a feeling while i was meditating ,2021-10-18 10:11:46
6197,  i found this sub and i just needed an outlet. i ve been struggling with depression for 10 years or so. always tried to solve the puzzle as to why i ended up getting it  but maybe it s just genetics. lately i feel like i m in a type of depression limbo. i don t feel happy  sad  empty  or numb. that seems kinda weird since i haven t had this happen before. has anyone had this happen to them  like you re just there in the moment but everything else feels but memories feel as if your dreamt it and the future doesn t worry you ,2020-02-20 00:38:47
31787,i understand the reason people day those words. i understand that if i dont love myself  i ll become codependent and place my own self value in someone else but i dont give a f . i will never love myself. ever. i have hated myself for too long. i have 0 self esteem  self confidence  or self love.   for this reason i know that i dont have to love myself because i know i love her. but she doesn t love me. and she never will. no one ever will. because along with depression i have a disease called being ugly af.   while we are on that topic  let s talk about another bullsh t thing people say.  looks dont matter  if they didn t matter  then we wouldn t have science that proves it. sure. maybe there are a few people who learn to look past looks but its literally proven that people are more physically and sexually attracted to symmetrical people.... but i digress. i doubt anyone even made it this far in my whiny b tch fest. 244 more days til i end it.,2020-05-18 17:31:32
77923,no matter what i try  i m constantly fighting a losing battle against imbalance. i m sick of these fruitless efforts. i ve spent so many years  so much money and so much energy only to get what feels like nowhere. i wish i could crawl in a hole and all of my feelings would stop  but that s not possible. the only way to end the suffering would be to end myself but i refuse to attempt that ever again. i m impatiently waiting for science to advance enough to discover some cure for this  but i know it s ridiculous to expect scientists to uncover the remainder of human mysteries when they themselves are humans struggling in their own ways. i know we are responsible for these revolutionary discoveries ourselves as the human race. it just sucks that because we are humans that we hinder the progress.,2020-11-08 13:54:56
185036,i have major depressive disorder   gad and have been taking lexapro for quite some time to treat it. the medication worked like a charm in terms of quiting the thoughts in my head and essentially making me just not give a shit about anything  which definitely felt great but did not help with maintaining friendships . the only problem is the medication made me incredibly tired and i lost all motivation to work out or get anything done that wasn t sitting on the couch being content doing nothing at all.   i m wondering if there are any medications that i might be able to talk with my physician about that would help but maintain or improve my energy levels at the same time   cheers ,2021-11-20 19:19:09
121457,i ve always had depressive states and episodes over the last ten years of my life  but i never thought moving in with the person i wanted to spend my life with would make it worse.  i ve waited 4 years to move in with my boyfriend and i always thought when the day finally came that living alone  and with someone i love  will help my depression get better and i will finally be happy.  instead  here i am now  severely depressed  crying all the time  irritated with everything and wanting to disappear and never feel anything again. i go from feeling absolutely empty and exhausted emotionally to crying and wanting to rip my heart out to make the pain stop. i don t know what to do  i don t know how to make it stop  how to make it better  how to not hurt.   i keep wondering where it went wrong  what did i do  how could have i avoided this  i m torn between wanting to go back to the time we were happy and wanted to spend every minute with each other to accepting that it wouldn t have worked even if we kept trying because i want too much  need too much  expect too much  ask for too much.   what do you do when you feel like you re broken beyond repair and everything happening in your life just keeps making it worse  how do i become happy again when my whole life is falling apart around me and i don t want to be here to feel any of it anymore    getting over a breakup is so hard  but it s so much harder when you feel like your life will stop once that person walks out of it. i m just looking for some support and advice on how others got through similar situations. i can t do this alone anymore.,2021-04-07 23:03:06

166710,i m 18f  it s my first few weeks in college. i ve recently been slipping into old habits like ed and panic attacks and feeling suerslidal     i ve had issues with sh in the past in various ways  but i thought i got out of it the past year but things have gotten a lot heavier recently and i cut my wrist. i ve cut before but it was never really my thing  and i did it tonight and i m not even sure why. since i got here i ve been really stressed and taken to scratching my forearms open just with my nails  but tonight i actually used a razor. i wasn t crying or freaking out  i was just numb. completely numb except in between every 5 cuts or so i d stop and think about how disappointed everyone would be if they knew  and then i would remember i m all alone here and i d just go back to doing it. i have a therapist that i see once every 2 weeks  but he told me  depression isn t real  people just get sad sometimes  ik he s shit  but i m trying to get my cat here as an esa and he s known me for awhile so once he signs for my cat and i get the cat in my dorm i ll find a new therapist. i just don t know what i m doing anymore. i m so lost and empty and alone here. i m so disappointed in myself every day and now it s just more so  i wish i was someone else and i wish that person was happy. also my boyfriend of almost 2yrs is coming in a week  do i tell him ,2021-09-16 21:20:28
108064,it feels like i can t break the cycle of mental and emotional torment day in and day out. i wake up everyday knowing that it s gonna be a day filled with hurt for no reason. i watch as people i know get to success but it feels like nothing i do is of value to my life or to anyone around me. i always feel alone. i always feel abandoned. i have faced so much rejection in the past 5 years that i wonder if it s even worth leaving the house at this point. as a kid i was the one who always wondered  i wonder what it s like to have depression like those people  now at the age of 23 i wonder  i wonder what it s like to be happy  or even mildly content with life .   anytime i try to open up to anyone about my problems i m always met with  i m sorry i can t relate  or  man that sucks  and then they forget we even had the conversation in the first place weeks later. i just want to know why everything hurts. why i can t be happy  even slightly content... or why i m always just sad and angry at everything.   it s like everyone just passes me by and doesn t know the torment i m in every day i wake up. every terrible memory of my life just haunts me day in and day out reminding me i m worthless and alone and no one cares. no one wants to hear me  and when i do speak  it just echoes off the walls and everyone forgets that i said anything in the first place.   i believe in god  but i m convinced he s up there laughing at misery. im his favorite punchline. wondering every day when he s gonna end my misery. i don t think i m exactly suicidal  but if someone came up to me and killed me  or if some event happened that killed me... i wouldn t even care.   i just want to know what it s like to feel happy  or feel cared about  or even acknowledged that i exist. video games  playing music  etc... nothing numbs or distracts me anymore. it s like the pain is to much for my mind to go any other place now.,2021-02-08 23:17:49

97771, so my birthday is coming up next month  on day x  and i ve always had to celebrate it with my aunt whose is right before mine. i ended up growing to hate it or at least not care for it as much as i should have because i grew up in an mentally and physically abusive household and birthdays were also highly stressful. . after my dad left i didn t have to worry as much until college.  now  i have a friend  h for reddit s purposes  whose birthday is two days after. ever since i ve known him our two other friends  we re a pretty tight knit group of 4  have put our birthdays together. h is dating friend 1 and shes big on birthdays. the first year friend 2 s ex joined in on the bday bash because theirs is after mine but before h.   eventually i ended up dating friend 2 and it got a little messy. we re still  friends  but now all i think about when my birthday comes up is how friend 2 s ex s birthday is on x  what happened there  and how every single year i can t get my own birthday without it being merged with someone else s. i don t even want to do anything because i m so tired all the time. i always tell everyone i dont want anything  to do anything  etc. but no one ever listens.   i ve been doing a good job disassociating lately but today i had a customer at work  older might i mention  hit on me and it made me very uncomfortable i went home highly paranoid and when trying to tell a friend was ignored because my friends are wanting to merge h s  mines  and another friends birthday together next month and the group chat was blowing up. also found out it s going to be so expensive  at least to me  and i cant tell if it s my depression telling me it s too much but i just couldn t stop crying when i got home from work. they re wanting to add an extra possible 4 people to this  trip  but with certain cases rising i m worried about air bnbs and just how safe they are. i almost literally cannot afford to have to miss work because of a certain panorama. friend 2 made a comment about how annoying it was they were grouping everyone together in couples  they grouped us together  and it made everything worse. i agree  but the comment broke the glass. i don t want to go. i don t want to do anything for my birthday. but now i feel like i d be a ah for backing out. i ended up drinking a but to try and get back to the dissociative state or maybe even giggly to cheer myself up but what i had left was not enough.   side note i have reread this several times and now feel like a whiny baby for even posting this. i ve read the rules of the sub and am hoping i m not violating anything.,2021-01-05 00:18:36
1792,whenever you air up your tires  or have them rotated changed  always get your spare inspected.  the tire can still slowly leak over time  or may be missing altogether. it s usually assumed to fine from last time the driver saw it  or forgotten about altogether.  doing this will save you a major potential headache. it will also guarantee you won t be stuck because of a flat and flat spare.,2021-04-20 03:54:56
9436,hey y all  i ll start off by saying that i already made a post here  but i deleted it because i got busy.  i love meeting new people online  there s something charming about online people  isn t there   and they re even better when you click with someone from the get go  leading to a long term friendship  just so you know  i like to think i m a  good  conversationalist and my messages are usually well thought so i m mostly interested in people who know how to hold a conversation. i won t reply to a barebone  hi    hey  and so on. you get my point     here s a bit about me     bioengineering student  i m supposed to design cyborgs  ais  mind controlling stuff and more. no worries  i won t trick you into making use of any weird chips. maybe      i love space. it s my favorite thing. it s empty  and if my charisma could be put inside a bottle i guess you could say space is as empty as said bottle but it s still beautiful  isn t it    i m a car guy and obviously i m team manual. i won t discriminate you if you drive an automatic  though. no one is perfect  right      with that said  i loooove cars. car culture is neat    being a car guy i m into f1 as well. cheering for lewis. max has been acting like a baby lately  d   i play games  and i used to be into competitive shooters  esports   won some prizes too  but it s not as cool as it sounds and i m glad i left. too much toxicity so i play games casually now.    my favorite show is the expanse  which surprisingly  not  is set in space  the current bad guy has my same name  bonus points if you know      i m italian but i dislike spaghetti. they re boring. at the same time  i don t mind pineapple pizza. it s colorful  what s not to love    i think that s more than enough for now. if you think there s a chance of us clicking  feel free to hit me up  i ll try to get back to you as soon as i can     cheers  d,2021-12-11 12:26:42

85391,i ve  21f  never been so unmotivated to do work for class. for the past month or even longer i ve been sleeping or playing games to avoid doing schoolwork. i would turn in occasional assignments  but skip a lot too. i don t usually do this. i ve missed assignment before but not this much.   i m at the point where if i think about what i have to do i will just start crying and go lie in bed. i feel like i already gave up on school but if i do  i ll postpone my graduation by a whole year. but i see no way for me to somehow do everything in the last 2 weeks of the semester. my logic tells me that i need to do certain things to pass class and be a good student but i can t get myself to feel any urgency.   in general  i don t have the best grades  but i m not a complete slacker either  not until now. the only time i don t feel upset is when i either accept that i gave up  or ignore school. but  i love the major i m in  and what i could be doing post graduation. i have an internship lined up in the summer. i would hate myself if i ruined my life because of this.   some things i ve done already to try to help  but it hasn t  yet anyway .  talked to a counselor at my university   get a small part time job to make me go outside since classes are online  confide in my boyfriend a ton  what am i supposed to do to feel the urgency to do work again   fyi  i am back home  finishing the semester off online. i thought a change of scenery would help but it didn t. i really just want an excuse to tell people why i m slacking.  like an accident or something. i get anxious thinking that people will look down on me. and i m mad that i m not meeting my own expectations too.   i m just hoping for something big to just smack me out of this before i fail all my classes this semester.,2020-11-30 02:45:50
1983,pull your fridge out and vacuum under  around  and behind your fridge. vacuum the air intake vent and if there is a panel that can easily be removed in front of the air intake vent  remove that and carefully vacuum inside  unplug your fridge first .  refrigerators are largely dependent on air flow. the more air flow  the better it will run.  do not push your fridge all the way back against the wall  leave 2 3  of space. you should also have 1 8th or more on the sides.  check your refrigerator manual for the right amount of space behind and on the sides for your particular model ,2021-04-25 17:33:50
200198,it s 6 30am when i m writing this  i m laying on the couch  my bed  my stupid brain doing that thing is does and i came to a realization  i may have not ended my life  but i damn well lost the battle against my depression.   allow me to explain  about  four years ago  give or take. no  six. i had first run in with depression  and i mean  severe  depression. i was in college  and i spent the vast majority of my time inside of my room  hating my very existence. i lost the battle when i was kicked out of college for missing too many classes.   ever since then  i haven t been able to hold down a job longer than a month  i spend money on stupid shit just so i can have something to look forward to. i made the decision two years ago to stop working and focus on my mental health. my best friend  nah  my damn sister  has been helping me financially. i just feel like garbage for putting her in this position to begin with.   man  my life has literally amounted to nothing. i m a college drop out with 45 cents to my name. i don t speak to my family because i was horrifically abused by them for so many years. it messed with my mind on a damn cellular level meaning  my very personality was altered. i have c ptsd  anxiety  depression  borderline traits  impulse control issues  and paranoia. it s a damn zoo in my head.   i like to think i m regaining my foothold on life  that i ve made leaps and bounds mentally. but  truthfully  i m no further along than i was six years ago  huddled in that college dorm room. only difference now is that i m older  and i ve moved since then. but other than that  i have nothing left to live for. i will never end my life  i could never do that to the few people i have left in my pathetic existence  but  i m a husk.   i m just a walking corpse who barely functions anymore. i can t even cry correctly. my therapist a man who did so much for me passed away from cancer  and i couldn t even cry. i felt sad  of course  but  i just wasn t physically capable of crying. according to my research  i ve spent so long suppressing my emotions  it s just hardwired into my brain to go numb instead of cry.   can you believe i actually miss crying  man  what i d do to have one of this snot faced  can hardly breathe  curled up in a ball  crying sessions. it would feel so damn good. but i can t even do that right. my damn abuser  hell  even myself  has done a number me. i ve lost my fight with depression  and i don t know if i ll ever recover.   i don t think i will. this will just be my existence from now on. my sad  meaningless  existence.,2022-01-18 09:43:17
163936,i m struggling really bad. i ve been avoiding myself from people outside of my immediate family due to my disorders  bpd   avpd .  i just feel so alone yet i avoid people. it s absolutely disgusting and i cannot ask for help because i already know the solution to my problems. then again if i become friends with someone i panic and worry if i go into a spiral due to me being super excited about them if that ll just seem super strange. if i sense the slightest tension between me and someone i become so withdrawn and i go into panic mode. i can t eat. i can t focus. i avoid people. then it doesn t matter anymore. then it does. it truly does. then i reach out to make peace. then it becomes a vicious cycle until i completely remove myself due to fear of abandonment or  and not wanting to be burden to anyone.  i lie and say i m fine and that i ve been fine all this time but deep down i do wish i had friends. it kinda feels weird admitting that.  i immerse myself in creating stuff because truly if i didn t all i could think about is k     g myself  which is why i don t go to bed until i m dead tired. i just feel terrible. i always put everything on the back burner because i know even as soon as i have a meltdown i can just shift and it s like it never happened and i m literally fine. it s scary and i hate myself. my family always use to comment on my shifts and i just started avoiding them more as well. i also lost my therapist i use to have and i have to wait a while before i can get a new health card because i moved.  sometimes i think it doesn t matter. how i feel and think doesn t matter. because i spiral so much it s like i m living several realities. i just want it all to end.i m writing my feelings out because i m so tired of not even knowing who i am for sure. how could i ever be friends with anyone  exactly.,2021-09-06 23:10:52

2229,i finally made the effort to seek out medical attention regarding what i ve been experiencing lately with depression and anxiety. i ve been trying to wait it out to see if i felt better over time  and the opposite has happened.  it was suggested i try a combination of antidepressants and therapy  but i m just so afraid of the side affects of meds and if it would even be worth it long term. however  i m also at the point where i m willing to try because i m so tired of feeling this way. i just want to feel like myself again.,2020-02-08 00:20:01

24798,i m interested in a general sense  but i m also looking for specific advice.   my boyfriend has had depression for a long time and when we moved in together  he warned me that it wouldn t go away and i said i could handle it. i could handle it... mostly. we ve lived together for over a year and a half now and it s been ok. except now that we are quarantining  i realize just how much i depended on seeing others to lift me up. i am now realizing just how miserable my boyfriend is all the time and how much it s effecting me. i feel like i might have slowly been slipping into my own depression for a long time and not been realizing it... my old life has kinda faded away.  now i m starting to wish we never moved in together because it has put me in a place i m not sure i can escape from.   it wasn t until recently that i realized he wasn t getting better  i was getting worse. but he always tells me he s bad for me and he s worthless  etc. typical negative depression talk. i have been telling him that that s not true and reassuring him.    i m terrified of bringing up the issue because know he it will just affirm what he knew all along  that he s hopeless. how can i communicate with him without destroying him ,2020-04-24 23:13:59

3687,if there is a number on the check do not call that number. look up the institution s number on their website.   this can also happen if you recently won the lottery or even ordered a service online.  one type of fraud  sometimes the person who sent it will tell you to deposit the funds  then they ll tell you they  accidentally  sent you more than what was due and for you to send them the difference back. if you do  that money is legit  but their fraudulent check will bounce in a few days and you will be on the hook for it with your bank.  another   secret shopper scam  https   www.consumer.ftc.gov articles mystery shopping scams  where they might send you funds to buy something  but then the check bounces and you end up owing the bank.  there is so much check fraud now. be careful and protect yourselves ,2021-06-09 13:35:38

112029,it is the same story repeated over and over again. i become depressed over how i ve ruined my life  i decide to try and make a change  i start making the change  i try to normalize the change  something bad happens  things eventually go back to the way they were before i made the change  the cycle starts again.   an example of this is how i would try to deal with my daydreaming habit by drawing. i figured that drawing would help me daydream a little less  so i decide to start drawing. i eventually start to get into a flow to the point of where i m drawing nearly every day. then i get stuck on a drawing because of how difficult it is to deal with a specific part. eventually  i stop drawing and revert to day dreaming and the cycle eventually restarts again. i can say the same thing about job hunting  exercising  sleeping  reading  anything that is supposed to be good for me in general.     i m tired of having this happen to me. i ve tried everything i could to prevent this cycle from continuing  alarms  to do lists  reminders  getting started on the task earlier  etc  but none of it was enough. at this point i have come to the conclusion that i will never be able to change on my own with the  normal  methods.  i think it will take some type of powerful  torture techniques for me to stick to the change. i don t want to be like this anymore. i just don t want to be me anymore.,2021-02-21 22:18:34

2036,the only thing overwhelming about a state that comes back for you is the fact that you are in some way allowing it by giving it importance and continuous attention. it s almost like an addiction or obsession with bad states  to not desire something that is present is still a desire. that s why they keep coming back. you are pushing it away with resistance.  you think there is something that needs to be looked at there but you end up in a cycle all over again. in psychology  we are taught to look into our minds but in meditation  we learn to leave it. it s another trick of the mind. you grew up with your mind  so it knows exactly where your fears and triggers are...because you mentally created it whether you intended to or not.   it wants your attention  it wants your identification with it  it wants you to keep thinking itself  it s a mechanism and that is just how it functions.   this is not to say emotions and states won t come  but we don t need to give it so much meaning and attention....it s like feeding a beast. focus on your breath  your spirit  and your awareness. empty it all out. there is a vaster space that when seen and placed attention there  becomes a true and clear seeing.,2021-05-19 01:09:02

5769,hello everyone   i am trying to learn the method of meditation and reaching the jhanas taught by ajan lee dhammadano and thanissaro bhikku. ajan lee having wrote  keeping the breath in mind   thanissaro used and explained the same method in his book  with each and every breath  .  both talk about spreading and connecting in every part of the body breath  sensations  or  energies . problem is  i don t know what they are talking about. i can t feel them really. i can t visualise them either. when ajan lee tell to pass the breath sensations through the skull  down the spine  through the toes into the air  i cannot feel or imagine any of it. actually  i m wondering if the point is to imagine it or am i suppose to actually feel it   can someone explain me what they meant  how can i see them or visualise them ,2021-12-21 20:43:41
196115,really i know myself i am not.  but last week till now i question myself what happened in my life that led to this result.  i experienced low self esteem for when i was young and became obvious more and more i grew up but i was like that s fine no problem....could i blame my parents for not taking action on me knowing that low self esteem have bad consequences or did they trust me to grow up confident with age idk.  i thought life was great for me but really i was too naive to know my deadly flaws that have put me where i am now.....feeling hated by society always needs others approval .....but most case scenario that made like this is because i didn t find myself in anything i saw people were better in alot of stuff i was in shock .....i always say dumb dumb stuff and make careless mistakes....did i not learn from life am i that dumb or what is my problem i can t grasp really the essence of all of this also being low on knowledge and street smart.  feels like being lost and 24 years of age well wasted.  maybe i have add but idk if this is an excuse cuz i see people on reddit have it but they don t have what i have....they just struggle with chores and forgetting stuff but i don t think it goes as much as my low self esteem.  i am not bad  maybe i woke up on life too late and i just need time to identify the cause of this all.  i sleep all day in severe depression and anxiety and i can t get it out of my head what i ve done with my life  social anxiety is killing me and the only thing i found myself on is have smart eq which not a main topic for any of the jobs out there.,2022-01-02 09:05:11

4915,to explain this  we re going to use a dice analogy.what if  the person you re comparing yourself to in any aspect of life  rolled a 6 first go  sure the odds for everything are different  but hopefully you get the idea.they were looking for a life partner  amp   rolls dice   6  found them straight away. they started a business   amp   rolls dice  6  it was a huge success. this is going to happen to 1 in 6 people. it s just the way the odds work.but it s meant to take 6 rolls of the dice  before you find that person. before that business works. sometimes it takes 12 rolls. sometimes  if you re unlucky enough  it ll take 20.keep improving  keep at it  amp  keep rolling the dice. forget when other people get their 6.,2021-07-14 04:56:47

62079,i ve spent ten years in a haze  telling myself tomorrow is the day i ll try. tomorrow is the day i ll start to work on my goals and dreams and i am just so tired of lying to myself. i spend most days with my head in my hands or buried in coping mechanisms  but i want out. i want something better.   i ve wanted to draw for years. i still have my tablet sitting right in front of me but whenever i think about trying it feels like someone is zapping my brain with every bit of negativity i have. fear of failure  of committing to something but still coming up short or just giving up when it gets hard... whatever the reason i freeze up until i just move on and don t try. i bury myself in the most base  simple distraction because it s the most easy  low effort reward.  but i want to try damnit. i m sick of this  i m sick of suicidal thoughts and fear shutting down any hope or ambition i have  it s causing me so much frustration lately. i just want to grab my head and start screaming for it to work for five fucking seconds.  i am sure there s no actual real fix and i m screaming into the void  but how do you form a habit or hobby or even push yourself to try when your head is screaming that you ll fail ,2020-09-05 12:16:03
103778,i have been in this hole for days now. i m not even sure how many days at this point. i reside in my room and only leave when i have to because isolation seems to be the most effective way of coping thus far. locking myself away has been a habit for several years and it s mainly due to just how self abusive i can really be. no physical wounds but when you are constantly being yelled at and scolded by your own mind  things seem a lot more intense. i m glad i can t see my mirror in fear that i ll break it in a fit. this cycle is seemingly never ending and the hole i m in is the hole i ve been trying to fill for too long. i attempted suicide back in 2016 and i m having difficulty keeping such thoughts quiet.,2021-01-22 15:29:24

11294,so my depression is  very  treatment resistant. i ve lost track of how many different meds and med combos i ve tried. recently it was suggested that i try tms  transcranial magnetic stimulation   which has been proven to be effective for depression like mine. my psychiatrist referred me to the doctor who does it  but i ve been putting off actually making the appointment because i m scared.  you know how sometimes people don t like taking meds because they make them feel like they re not themselves anymore  like they make them feel numb or empty  it s sort of like that  except in reverse. i ve had my depression for well over a decade  more than half my life  and i literally can t imagine what it d be like if it actually got better. would i still feel like me  i know that things would improve  obviously  but change is scary  and in a bizarre way  my depression is comfortable. it s been a constant for most of my life and i don t know who i d be without it.  tl dr  i m scared to try something that could work because i don t know who i d be without my depression.,2020-03-06 12:09:00

177727,i don t really like the whole thing about  mental health matters   i feel that it is important to be happy but it really annoys me for some reason. i think it s mostly my parents that have caused me to think this  there s really no space to talk about your feelings here and it s all pushed aside.   lately i ve been feeling kind of down you could say  very unmotivated and no energy at all. i have tried so hard over the last few months to pick up something new that i think will make me feel better again and it might excite me for a day but then the next  it s the same thing all over again. i can t seem to enjoy anything anymore even if i try  even if it s something i liked before. it takes so much effort for me to do anything  i feel so heavy and i have the constant need to drag my feet as i walk because i just don t have the energy for it. my grades in school are really bad right now  i can t do work. i have 4 f s and my teachers have somewhat noticed asking if i need someone to talk to because i usually seem upset or i won t do work. i feel bad because i don t want to seem like i m unapproachable by other people  not to mention i barely talk to anyone in the first place. so all of that def makes it even better. my homelife is stressful at times  i mean i have really strict parents but they only care if i show up at school  so i can t go out anywhere and the worst part is they don t take me seriously or care about my grades at all. they don t expect anything from me and i constantly get criticized by them about everything. always getting in trouble for things i haven t even done  i don t know this is more of a vent now. i m just overly sad and i don t know what to do about it i want to kill myself because i can t care much about anything anymore. i basically already feel dead and i don t want real help involved i just want things to get better but i dont know how i am so tired of everything,2021-10-26 21:48:36

31481,the title says it all   i have a crush for almost an year now and every small interaction like a like on a post or something makes me more sad because i dont have the courage to start talking to her   and even if i had   i know i would not have a chance . the rest of my life still a mess   i feel like jo one cares about me and i could die and no one notice   and the biggest thing that infuriates me is that i cant cry   im 17 and i cant remember last time i cried but it was once when i was 6 and someone bullied me   but my parents told me to be a man and to man up and not cry anymore   so now even if i have dust lr smth iritates me   i barely drop a tear and my instant move is to turn around and wipe it out even if no one is there . all i want is to release all the anger and frustation   and now i feel again at a very low moment in my life but i cant still cry . do u know any way i can force it  ,2020-05-17 18:13:28

9278,title.   i ve found that most conversations about politics usually degrade into a slander fest of just hating on the supposed  other  party or entity and got pretty tired of it. so i started asking the question  what is your political party doing for you  as a way to either get the topic to something that s meaningful or end the conversation.   and the responses have been pretty great.   i ve gotten things like     blank stare into the abyss as they realize they actually have no idea what their party is doing   full on admitting that they support racial discrimination and want their party to enforce it   surprisingly  sometimes actually had good policy discussions   conversation immediately ending   at the end of the day  if you re stuck in a conversation you don t any to be in simply walking away  if possible  is advisable but if you re willing to throw some coals in the fire i recommend trying it ,2021-11-09 07:25:18

45079,i mean i guess that s like the point and like the most obvious and common thing to say whole depressed but fuck. i m lucky enough to have people who support me  but maybe it s the anxiety in me i just think there doing cause if they don t i ll just kill myself. i have tried just not talking to them but then i get that bottled up feeling and can t stand it  but then when i do talk to them about how if i feel like i m manipulating them into even giving a shit. like none of them really like me they just talk to me every now and again so i don t die. the fucked thing is i can see the flaws in that and they have reassured me hundreds of times that i m not hurting them and they care and love me. i just can t feel it form them  and it puts me in a position in which i have no fucking idea what to do. there is no winning.,2020-07-04 00:16:32
55156,i was already down before covid but the pandemic made everything worse. as someone who can honestly now claim that my friends have either ignored or used me  i m fed up. if that s not enough  i hate being at home. i hate being put down and criticized for the smallest things. i m at a point where i realize that if i ruined my only chance to be able to move out of my parents house on time  i m offing myself. life s not worth it anymore.,2020-08-09 23:27:41
88953,i m having a hard time typing so i will keep it a bit short.  recently i was supposed to go outside of the city with my mother  whom i do not like to begin with. all of a sudden now she s like we can t go for whatever the reason. i messed up a meeting recently and made a complete fool out of myself  so now imagine showing up to my senior with  oh well now i couldn t go sorry . for anything  you let know early on that you can t do something.   basically my ego is completely humiliated. i started to have a panic attack because of this and also the fact that i passed on a part of my work to somebody else by lying that i wilk go out a day earlier. if he decided to do it a bit later  then eventually i will have to do it. the main reason why i lied was because i gained a lot of weight. i tried to do the work  basically a video  but i couldn t film it while my double chin was popping out. i even binged today.  i work with an ngo  and if i continue to stress out like this then i don t think i m suited to work for any firm in general. i broke my keyboard out of anger and my therapist isn t available today. i tried calling her.  please help.,2020-12-10 12:51:45
118779,everyone may tell me there s nothing wrong with me  that i should just calm down and stop being dramatic or whatever but this is honestly the truth.  at this point i m done with my life  i m just existing not leaving. i m exhausted of being ignored  unable to do shit by myself  being left out  feeling the worst daily  hating my appearance... the list could go on and on but what s the point   my friends  gone  they just talk to me when they need something and ignore what i say but when someone says the same they are all paying attention and preaching it. family  they really are better without me  i can t believe that after years and years i can t feel safe and fully happy with them for more than a couple hours.   i don t know why i m still typing  i guess posting here helps me kinda express myself but the pain is still inside me. i just want to go a day without crying  i want to matter and to live not only exist but i have no more hope. i m sure there are many people in worst conditions than me and i m sorry about that i wish i could help them but i can t even help myself.   i wish i could stop with the pain i feel and my thought as well but i can t even do that  why am i scared  i really have no more hope in life anymore so why can t i just do it... i m sorry if someone actually read this i m just all over the place.,2021-03-30 16:04:11

105527,hello    im 22  in uni and tbh  i just wanted to let my feelings out. my relationship ended on new years eve  funny because i met her back on new years eve 2018. we had a great life together but almost 3 years down the road to what i though would be forever  she decided she didn t want to be in a relationship anymore  anyways im the type of guy who would always put someone he loves before himself  i did just that and now im here.. idk what to do.   ive read through a few posts on here and honestly i feel bad about complaining  everyones going through their own pain and well i just feel like i still had way more than a lot of people  thanks to god   but still in one way or another i feel empty.. i really loved her and im quite sure that for some time i felt that love from her too  anyways i don t understand how someone would just leave you 3 years down the road when you ve built a whole fucking life together. i miss her  were still in touch and we have a cat  shes stays with her in the house we used to live in together  and i go visit now and then.   ive had issues before but i always grew out of them like they were some phase in my life.. but im just alone and broken rn and i don t think i have the courage to trust anyone anymore. i guess what im sad about the most is that even though i accepted  with a completely broken heart  that she doesn t love me anymore  im sad that i won t be able to share my life with her till then end anymore.   i still love her and im not ashamed to be honest about that with myself  but sometimes i just wish i didn t exist. so that this pain that seems to never fucking end would finally fuck off.   lastly  if you read through this id like to thank you for taking the time to. and i hope that you get through whatever pain and difficulty that you re going through too.,2021-01-28 18:00:15

152498,man  when i thought these months were going good  nope it was preparing me for this  2 weeks before i felt on top of the world  nothing could stop me. i was getting over my health anxiety and was ready. i was also about to score a new job and leave this cruddy one. it was all going good  until the next week. i found out that the job i was taking was a total scam. fine  time to just wait it out and try some online freelancing  fyi first time . oh look a job opportunity  nope two more scams that further irritated me  fun . fine  i guess i ll try to hang out with some fiends. i call a few people and text  no response for days . now i m starting to feel the partial feeling of depression. next thing i know  my school work began to pile up and was now behind  awesome   but the funny thing is  the week ended okay for me that is until sunday. without any explanation whatsoever  my ex who hated my guts after i broke up with her but i was cool with  dmed me months after our last talk. ok  i m not upset or angry at her  she changed alot and is happy with her new bf  something i was hoping she would get  but this was the match to light the fuel. after taking to her  i began to see how much good stuff she s gone through the years and i  shouldn t have done this  mistakenly started comparing her life to mine. that s where i took a total fall. i immediately blocked her because i was jeleous of her new life mind you i wished for her happiness  because i was so insecure at the time. luckily she dmed me in a unblocked account and that s how i found out i wasn t inheritly mad at her. now i m just at the bottom of my life. i feel burnt out and just lost a good deal of hope. i m so tired of having straight up bad luck i want good things to happen  i also feel karma may have something to do with this   i m just done.,2021-07-28 08:22:00

188474,once again i got into a huge argument with my parents over me talking about how my father had treated me  and my brother  since childhood. i brought up the physical abuse  the emotional abuse  manipulation  bullying  never apologizing  refusing to acknowledge his behaviour and never changing  ignoring us when we talked about how we felt when he would abuse us  he always has to disagree with me  always has to go against me even in front of others  always comments on weight and looks negatively  never happy with us  puts immense pressure on us for school and careers  mocks mental illness  putting us down constantly  mocking us  comparing us to others  not being there for us emotionally etc. my father  as always  tried to change the subject and tried to say that i started an argument from nothing. he then got upset and went to his room where he slammed the door multiple times and screamed he would never talk to me again.   this was something that went on a lot when i was a kid. anytime i would bring up being hurt by something he said or did to me  my father would shut me down by calling me crazy  saying i was overreacting  calling me an actor and telling me to move on. he made all my family think i was crazy and a brat because i was reacting to his abuse which he obviously hid to others.   my mother of course took his side as she always has. i ve been saying pretty much the same stuff since i was 13 about my dad and his treatment of us. she always finds a way to minimize what he did. she always has a reason for his actions as if abuse should have a valid reason. she finds a way to victimize him and to make it seem like i in some ways deserved the abuse. abuse  especially physical  was apparently happening in every home according to my parents. when i say that both me and my brother have been negatively impacted as adults in our 20s now  my mother refuses to believe our experiences have anything to do with how we turned out.,2021-12-02 20:18:23

1703,regarding the car thing  my grandma got too old to drive  but her car was still in excellent condition and sellable except for one thing   she had smoked in it for years and holy crap it stank  it was disgusting. we put 2 bowls of white vinegar in it  one in front seat  one in back  and put fresh vinegar in every 24 hours  and within a week the stench was gone.   i ve used the bowl of white vinegar trick for every stench imaginable and 99 percent of the time it works like a charm  even if it takes a few days.,2021-04-17 17:14:01
12253,from my experience  usually  people do in fact hear what you said and it is just a natural reaction to say  huh  to buy more time or just out of instinct. often times if you just let it sit for a few seconds they will end up replying regardless to your initial comment.,2022-01-30 09:21:48
170687,when i think i ve lost my sense of humor about life  about its absurdities and its wonders  i m lost in depression again.  i swear  i put it in the time and effort with therapies. allowed medication to help over time. i ve challenged myself to learn and grow and take chances and embrace uncertainty. it paid off.  yet i m depressed again  triggered by very similar circumstances and a lethargy. if i do x y and z  it will help. i know. but i m tired of x  y  and z and i m for the first time at 34 utterly hopeless. ok  that s the feeling  but there s hope  sure.  i m always wrong when i expect the worst  or when i expect suffering lasts forever. but damn  this time i m way too tired to deal. my resilience is practically gone.,2021-10-01 12:45:09
138631,i feel like i m at rock bottom right now and i don t know what to do with myself.  i m 23 and graduated two years ago from my dream program with hopes of finding something in my dream field  media . fast forward to now... i m two years into my job search  my resume has been rewritten countless times  and i ve only managed to secure a handful of interviews across that span.  i m now coming off of a rejection e mail from a job that i thought would be a layup. i had the experience  i feel that i killed it in the two interviews  and i had a recommendation from someone in the company. now i just don t know what to do.  my field is dominated by only a few major companies who own nearly every smaller company in the same field. they ve all received a large number of applications from me.  making things worse  my field has had so many layoffs due to the pandemic  and outside factors may end up making the school my ba is from less desirable.  i m at the point where i regret going into my dream field more than anything  and wish that i d chosen something safer. i feel like this one choice has fucked me over so badly.  i m considering just washing my hands of my field and forgetting about my degree so i can go back to school for something else. even then  i don t even know where to start  and i definitely don t want to waste more of my time on schooling only to make another wrong choice.  i m trying really hard not to cry while writing this post. i feel like i ve fucked my life up royally and if things don t get better  i really don t know how much longer i ll be around.,2021-06-08 16:04:17
19577,they know how much effort i have to make to do anything  and yet they act like i m a lazy piece of shit  even though i do everything i m supposed to. and anything my brother does is worthy of praising  they just went celebrating around the house because my brother finished his homework in 5 minutes instead of 2 hours  note  the delay is literally just because he s lazy . your brother this  your brother that. your brother spent all morning doing school work  i did the same thing but at the afternoon  but apparently it s not valid to them . when it s not my brother they re comparing me to it s people in my class that are studying harder.   and yet when i accomplish anything it seems like they don t even care. i want to jump of the fucking building but i live on the second floor so it d be useless. they should have never fucking conceived me them  what about wearing a fucking condom  it makes me so ashamed of myself  thinking about how much i was loved in my childhood  but now i m just the useless piece of crap no one wants.   the other day i read a small notebook that had cute notes friends of my parents and the rest of the family wrote for me before i was born. they were all full of expectations and love. i nearly cried  thinking how i could have been so loved and yet i m a failure. i wish i was never born  or at least died when i was seven  when i was still happy and lovable.  sorry for the long post  as it was meant to be short but i got out of control. and sorry if the english is bad.,2020-04-05 16:55:21
34974,i ve been depressed since february and have kept it to myself until a couple weeks ago. i told about it to my two best friends and now it seems like i m wearing them down with my negativity. one of them first wanted to help me but then i told her i m hopeless and now she s ignoring me and doesn t seem to care anymore. the other friend called me out yesterday saying that i don t care about her since i only talk about myself and that i don t appreciate her advice since i keep talking back to her and only come with negative comments. i just can t be positive and i m letting them down. i wish i had someone to talk to who wouldn t judge me or tell me to be positive or ignore me and who could handle all my negativity. or maybe i should continue to keep everything to myself since i just ruin everything by talking about it.,2020-05-29 10:21:33
61839,i have 1 week of feeling  ok   lying my teeth out pretending to be  happy   smiling and being supportive to everyone because that s what i do. i give myself to everyone so they can feel better. it feel so empty when i ask for understanding and company and all i get is  you are fine . i am right now overthinking like crazy  feeling paranoid. everyone wants to hurt me but nobody wants to finish the job. i find myself constantly fantasizing about dying on a car accident  being shot to death when in downtown  even death by cop sounds nice. i just want something someone to end my life so i don t have to feel guilty. you are the one that keeps me here  if it wasn t because you need me i would have blown my brains out that night. you should have left me do it.,2020-09-04 10:43:39

31534,i m in my late twenties now and i wonder day to day why i m still alive. i m finally married  we have a house although we might end up losing it due to layoffs  we have a dog and things should be right in the world for me. he loves me dearly  cares for me the best he can however i m just not happy. let me correct that  i m happy with him and i love him from the bottom of my heart however im not happy. i had a really shitty start in life  sexually abused  violent household. when i m not exhausted from nightmares  my mind constantly races  i m unable to focus and my brain just keeps replaying my past. i been to therapist  and i finally found one i was okay with but found no comfort  no help in other words.  i can sure fake being happy  and smile and be jolly but deep down i just want to fucking sleep for an eternity. i ve tried in the past reframing my thoughts  hypnosis  i ve tried doing short term goals and nothing seems to help  talking about it feels like the wounds are just constantly being ripped open and gives my brain nothing but a chance to bring up old memories and torture me by replaying them like an old broken record. i have no passion  no desire  motivation. i m sick of this world and even though i force myself to focus on the good i can t seem to let go. i been bullied most of my entire life  i hardly trust people and have terrible social anxiety so i only have two friends.  sitting at home on my ass all day doesn t do me well  even when i do things around the house i feel like a waste of space.  i ve even gone  missing   hardly in social as is but i just stopped answering text  calls for two weeks and no one noticed. so why would me slipping out of this world matter ,2020-05-17 21:10:37

178567,but the harsh reality is that it s not. i decided i didn t want to be alive anymore a long time ago and although i have attempted suicide  it was 2 4 years ago.   i did jump down the stairs earlier in the summer in the hope i died from the fall but i knew it was likely i d survive  so i don t claim that to be a suicide attempt. that was just hope.,2021-10-29 19:37:58
7316,if you are in an argument with someone  or you are in a lecture  or suddenly someone is getting louder than what you would like  you can lower your voice and he or she will match it. lots of people believe that when you holler or speak loudly  you have more power than the other party  but all it does is make you lose control of the situation and it also makes you angry for no reason. lowering your voice in this situation will help you in controlling the other person because he or she will get really confused as to why you lowered your voice and naturally try to match your tone. most people will realize they are being too loud at this point and would adjust appropriately.   props to  r kay,2021-09-16 00:26:21

92138,i feel like i try really hard and put alot of effort to make other people s lives easier and receive nothing back. if my friends ever need me i m right there. if my family need to talk i m always available. but when i need anything or when i m not doing the best  they either don t bother to help or they give me some half assed thoughtless advice. i feel like i m just entertainment to my friends. i make funny jokes and mess around with them. but that s it. i m a good distraction to them until they go back to their own lives and forget about me. i m not the best at socialising in the first place. i put in all this effort that i don t really have to give and people don t care at all. i cherish the friends i have and i m completely open to making new ones. but no one cherishes me. and it fucking sucks,2020-12-19 18:31:50
5294,it is the ego. it is identification with thoughts. thoughts have compelling content and they re useful but they re not the you you think they are. this you is in your body  doing its thing. it is not commandeered by thoughts. but they are its thoughts. what does this mean  jungian archetypes  battling out the eternal struggle of your conditioning  the shadow trying to take over because you let it be the master of this ship. work with your thoughts. but equally  work on your relationship to them. they are here to serve you. if they re not currently doing that then you re looking at them wrong. there is much to be seen. we are more complex than we think we are.   seeing reality becomes especially important when facing others. thoughts face inward. they now only what they know. they lead to projection and distance  walls between consciousnesses. open your eyes and see people. they are not their thoughts either. but most are yet under their spell. it seems  though  that extroverts may do this to a lesser degree. they live in this world more fully  less in their heads. combine the two powers. see that they are two sides of the same coin. inside and outside. you shall be free.  forgive yourself for the past that plagues you  it wasn t you. welcome the future  the eternal now  with open arms  for it is full of wonder.  thoughts  does any of this make sense  trivial ,2021-11-21 03:35:30

27088,hello  everyone  my name is m.  i ve 27yo actually and i ve something to tell  you than i never spoke..maybe  it isn t the good place for this post  because this is actually a real  story and it s only terrifying mor my  ownself i suppose...   excuse me if my english is not perfect  .  let me explain you..  when   i was 12 years old  i started having terrible but incredibly realistic   nightmares immersing myself in traumatic states of variable duration   upon waking.  in these dreams i often saw the same character  a huge  black silouhette wearing a mask which i can not describe the appearance  because it is permanently changed.  and when i approached this thing i  felt a physical sensation  like a source of very strong electricity   this sensation is enormously intensified thereafter.  over  time the  nightmares got worse and i started to feel like real pain. i  also  started to be able to observe the virtual time passing by   sometimes  remaining blocked for several  days  in my dreams  waking up  from a  night as if i had lived 3 days.  i started to try to defend  myself or escape from my nightmares but in vain  there is no other way  out than to wake up  and to wake up you have to go after the dream   because in the dream in real time does not exist  and the dream has all  the time to wait for you .. it is a catch of which you must relive each  chapter again and again ..  in  summary  i realized in my dreams that i was locked in my mind  and i  started to be able to act in it as in reality. the  problem is that i  had only terrible and repetitive nightmares  today 15  years later i  know each of these nightmares in every corner and it has  become a real  torture for me to know what awaits me every time that i  close my eyes  to reopen them in this horrible imaginary world.  so i started to see   and hear things that before only existed in my sleep.  and this feeling  of electricity worsened in my nightmares  until this thing was in my  dream capable of keeping me pressed to the ground. it is an excruciating  sensation  as if crushed by the gravity of the world  my breath cut    and an electric current around either. this causes me a terrible crisis  of tetany and anxiety.  today i  live in fear  of falling asleep  and in fear of being awake. i often  find it difficult  to differentiate my dreams from reality as these have  become real and i  no longer know where i am.. i have tried so many  things to get better or to stop thinking about it but it is impossible  to avoid them .. i feel today as a prisoner of my own mind and my  conscience .. i am actually no longer sure that this spirit belongs to  me when i see the horrors that unfold there again and again tirelessly  day after day ...  i m  terrified  and i m starting to believe that maybe all of this really  exists .. i m  just sleeping for 5 or 6 hours every 2 days.. i can  support it  anymore.. this is why in a last dash of hope i finally took my courage  to dare to speak about this ... i chose reddit because i had never come  on this network and here nobody will know who i am and will be able to  judge me opposite ... i don t really know what i m looking for by  telling you all this  you will surely not be able to help me  but i  needed to talk to someone about it at least once in this life..  thank you for reading me   i hope i ll find someone like me here who can explain me something about all of this shit..,2020-05-02 19:58:09
3981,we ve been asked over and again   what is the ego  the  self    well  what is it  is it yin or yang  is it inside or outside  stand back. i have a knife. it s a beauty with a long blade and a handle that grips to the hand. i throw it at a tree. it s bounces off. i throw it again  and the third time i throw it  the knife sticks into the tree. i go over to it and i touch the tree. the bark feels rough. am i really feeling the bark of the tree  or are electrical impulses traveling from fingers into hand up my arm to my brain at about 300 feet per second  think of that  they travel the length of an entire football field in one second  then at the same speed they leave the brain  go back down my arm into my hand and fingers so i  feel  the tree. i m not feeling the tree of course  i feel what my brain tells me to feel. when i see the tree i actually see what my brain tells me to see. when i smell bacon or a flower i actually smell what my brain tells me to smell. and so on. i reach up  grab my knife  wiggle it and pull it out of the tree. well of course  it s an expensive knife  i m not going to just leave it there in the tree. did i feel the knife  or did i just feel what my brain told me to feel was the knife. the latter of course. so what you need to ask your self is... what does your brain tell you  outside  inside  yang  yin... self. ego. when you touch it  what does your brain tell you to feel       thank you for reading   ,2021-08-30 16:09:48
5670,my big boy cat was diagnosed with asthma in 2017 after an attack in which we took him to the er. he started having another this weekend  so we took him in to see a dr. long story short  16 hours later he s was coughing blood and was told to say our goodbyes. turns out he had an underlying heart condition which led to his lungs filling up with fluid and blood. perhaps with regular thorough checkups we could have discovered this condition earlier  but we just keep getting asthma checkups only. please  get your pets checked.,2021-08-01 12:57:38

6967,what bills do you need and what bills do you not  can you get rid of your cable bill and get a roku or similar device  if so  do so.  can you get rid of your home phone bill and just use your cell phone  look around for cheaper cell phones and cheaper cell phone bills out there.  go to the cheapest grocery stores around your area. buy in bulk when you can.  don t cheap out on shoes. buy shoes that will last for years  same with other stuff.  go to yard sales and similar. you might be surprised with what you can find for cheap.  you can get inexpensive exercise equipment  laundry room essentials  bathroom essentials  kitchen essentials and so on. you just have to research different prices at different stores.  don t keep buying the newest biggest thing. if it s something you truly want  put it on a wish list for a later time.  keep care of yourself. health bills can get expensive if you don t eat right and drink water.  take care of your vehicle. change your oil and check the tires regularly. ignoring these things can be expensive down the road.  get tools  learn fixing skills that will help you so you don t have to pay extra money for someone else to do it. there is youtube  different books to learn skills and so on.   get a deep freezer if you don t have one. it s great for storing extra food.   just because something is for sale  doesn t mean you have to get it. ask yourself questions  how often will you use it  do you actually need it  and so on.,2021-09-06 14:17:10
46079,hey all  i m fairly new to reddit so i m not 100  sure what i m doing  but i get the jist. anyways  here goes nothing  may be some triggers below.  i ve had mild depression since middle school  and for the most part  i ve been doing okay. until recently. my ex boyfriend has been harassing me   again    which has caused an onslaught of unpleasant memories to hit me. i ve also been having a really shitty time at work  my co workers like to take their frustrations out on me.  it s taken a huge toll on my mental and physical health during this past week. i try to talk to people about it  but they all seem largely uninterested  which i understand  it s not their problem to deal with.  i don t really have anyone to vent to. i m not trying to seem like a victim here either  i m just venting how i feel. i understand that i need to work on myself to make things better.   i haven t slept in two days and all the pent up stress had been affecting my performance at work. i constantly feel everyone hates me and thinks i m annoying. it s been making me super suicidal and i don t have any motivation to do anything. i was also out of work for three weeks  because i had to get tested for covid and it took three weeks to get my results back...  and now i m super fucking broke. like in the negative hundreds. my parents are also being super hard on me to save money and be more responsible. i feel like everyone in the world is against me  and i m only liked when they can use me for something. this isn t supposed to be a pity post  i would just love to talk to people who have been going through similar dilemmas  or just anyone that can give me any tips or advice on how to break this cycle. i don t go to therapy  can t afford it  and don t really have many friends i can bother with this type of thing. i m starting to feel very alone and feel like i should isolate and distance myself from others. i just don t feel like i bring anything to the table  and i feel like i just annoy everyone around me. of course  it s probably because i m generally a negative person  but i truly am trying my best to fix that.   amp  x200b   thanks for listening   lt 3,2020-07-07 07:48:49
4638,often times employer has more to lose than an employee in case of an information security breach and loss of reputation due to sexual harassment lawsuits. this the key reason why employers invest heavily in making such sensitive training mandatory for their employees.  there is definitely a benefit for employees as well from learning and awareness point of view but the benefits scale tilts towards the employer heavily.  pay attention to the agreement checklist in the last section of your mandatory training  you will clearly see that the agreements will shift maximum responsibility permitted by law onto you than your employer.,2021-07-06 19:57:33

38622,i can t trust my parents to find one for myself. i m 18 years old and i ve finally reached a breaking point where i can t move forward in life without receiving some sort of help. earlier this year and in december i asked my dad and my mom if i could go see a therapist. they vaguely asked why and i explain as much but also as little as possible without going into too much detail. my mom said that she forgot and my dad never does anything so i shouldn t have trusted him. i asked my mom again and she said that she forgot.   so i m done relying on them. cause i don t want to do anything crazy and i feel like i have certain moments were i definitely reach that point or get near it. so i just wanted to ask. how can i search up and find a therpaist  even with this lockdown still in effect and also with things trying to open up again. how would i find one ,2020-06-11 21:28:37

8304,am i overreacting  if you were excited to plan a really neat surprise date for your fianc  s birthday and you bring it up to his best friend s fianc  that you want her fianc  to be there  bc my fianc  and her fianc  are best friends  and she flips everything and makes it about her   is that shady  after inviting her  she now also wants to surprise her so with my gift but is basically making me work around her schedule and does not want me to communicate with her significant other. really has made something i was excited about stressful and complicated to cater to her.   i was so happy to get this going and suddenly i feel like it s no longer about my fianc  s birthday but about her wanting to now surprise her so with my surprise birthday plans   . i feel i would never have reacted the way she did and feel so let down. we would have accommodated her had she asked us to attend something for him without making it about us. thoughts ,2021-11-11 00:25:38

108843,i told myself i wasn t going to write anything but here i am. it takes a lot of pride for me to express myself. i feel like i should be the bigger person and deal with it on my own you know. i m 14  i know i m young and i have a life to live  i ve heard it all before. just like everyone else i just want someone to talk to. i have people i can talk to   i have the most supportive family you could possible think of but that s what holds me back. i vented to my siblings the other day  and it only made me feel worse. i never thought it would make me feel worse but it did. it felt like lost hope  because they think that it will be over in a few days but they don t know how serious i am about it. i told them i feel crazy like i want to jump off a freeway  i obviously had a limit. i didn t tell them absolutely everything about it but i was fine for that day and it just came back all over again. i don t know what i was expecting. i know they love me and care for me but i don t want to worry them. i don t wanna tell them that im giving up  i m not on the verge of giving up  i ve already given up. and i m okay with it. it made me realize how pointless my life is and how i m only here because i ve been living for other people. i wouldn t have it any other way. and it s like once it s all watered down your left with this numb feeling. it s like telling you it s okay to do the things you want but it holds you back it makes u afraid to try the things you want again. i don t know what it is i m afraid of clearly but i m afraid to do the things i ve been wanting to do. i feel like if i do the things i want it will be pointless bc it ll just come back again. it s like a cycle   this is your break but it will start all over again  it s just an empty feeling your left with that will get rained on again you know. i ve learned to live with it  i m tired of pretending and i m not going to keep on doing it. i don t care about myself that s why i put others first before me. i feel like they ll put better use into things than i ever will. but maybe the reason i ve been putting people first is like giving me permission   i m been nice to you so let me have this type of thing yk . my family is planning a quick trip somewhere this saturday maybe it s my sign. i laugh at myself because i feel pathetic for feeling this way.,2021-02-11 17:28:48
51597,i grew up in a household with parents who both worked full time jobs to make ends meet. so as soon as i turned 15  i was thrown in to the work force because not only did my parents not have money to give me  but i was taught that i would have to work if i wanted a car  wanted money to go out with friends  etc. i ve had so many different jobs over the past 10 years throughout high school  college  etc.   no matter what the job was  how shitty hot miserable it was  i ve always generally liked holding a job.  i m now 26 and married  with a house and bills. i m a lowly office assistant at a factory that makes fucking boxes. how absolutely meaningless  right  my depression has been especially tanking the past couple years and i don t feel like i can go on any further. did anyone s depression get worse the more you realized you had to be an actual adult and that there was never any going back    i need my job more than i ever have but i just want to get fired. i just want to quit. i ve been looking at jobs related to my degree but the job pool isn t fabulous right now you know  considering we re in the midst of a fucking pandemic. i also feel so undeserving  like no one would ever hire me.   i would do anything to not have to come to work anymore. i used to think people who felt this way about going to work were just melodramatic or spoiled.,2020-07-27 14:38:38
4766,today i started meditating after a long time and had an intense meditation session. i meditated about 15 minutes although i wanted to keep meditating my head muscles were getting really tense i had to stop. one of the strangest things that happened was that  although it started like any other meditation session i did before  this time  about 9 10 minutes into meditation  i started seeing beings vividly in my head. and i could feel that they were also seeing me. one of the beings was a humanoid head statue with 3 eyes and a hat  in a hot desert  half covered by sand but sentient inside. another being was a fish with human face under a deep ocean. while i had an easy almost conversation like connection with the statue being  i don t know how to explain it  it felt like there was a mutual understanding between us   i couldn t connect to the fish  almost felt like there was a barrier between us. i was able to feel both of these beings watching me while my eyes were closed and as soon as i wanted to remove the barrier between the fish and me  my head muscles got very tense that i had to stop. it is interesting to me  has anything similar to this happened to anybody  what should i understand from this ,2021-10-17 19:31:23

80038,it was some years back but it came into my head again. it was a 17 year old boy who died. he was found dead in his car during some dead hour of the morning on a cold winter night. apparently his body was half frozen solid  he had bruises on his neck  he was throttled to death  and blood had dripped out his mouth. his neck was broken. the only people he was with that night were three friends. they killed him for no apparent reason and a witness who saw them hanging out before he got killed said nothing seemed out of the ordinary. for some reason when i think of this one i always cry. why  is it normal   i know he probably only suffered for a few minutes but those few minutes keep going through my head in vivid detail whenever i remember it. mainly from the perspective of the kid  like him feeling betrayal  wondering why his friends were suddenly killing him. feeling his lungs burn from a lack of air  thrashing about in a dark car going insane  drowning in blood because the neck got broken  heart rate pounding because you can t breathe and you re also being slowly crushed to death as well. and during this no help comes.  he died some 7 years ago  i feel so bad for the kid. i don t believe in ghosts or spirits but i wonder if in the future his parents could get him cloned or something from whatever remained  i read dna can last up to 10 000 years or something like that  because i feel like i m grieving over his death  and also grieving for his family  even though i never actually knew him. basically clone him to give him a new chance at life.,2020-11-14 05:45:02

146729,i ve been rejected and dumped do many times and it doesn t hurt anymore it just fuels me to succeed which sounds good at first but it only fuels me so i can show the people that have hurt me that they re like missing out and i fucking hate it but love it at the same time i hate how fucked it is but love how it motivates me to do what i want to spite those who hurt me i know this doesn t really belong here but if anyone knows why this happens like a mental illness please tell me,2021-07-07 18:46:50
196036,my life is fun and weird and there have been times where i am the happiest person in the world for little things like hearing a song i like or just having a good time with friends. but when it comes to big goals in life  the ones i dream off  i always seem to have rlly good luck  whatever the goal is i always get it and always achieve it by manifesting and committing to it but each time i do it i m only noticing one thing. no matter how much you ve fantasized or dreamed about doing something  being with someone or any goal  it s always incredibly underwhelming and not how u pictured it. it s only until after when i look back at my accomplishments that i feel any kind of gratitude. so even after getting a girl that i m falling jn love with being having a killer band and playing shows often for larger audiences all the things i could ever want i continue to feel nothing but sadness day after day and i can t seem to even get back any of those little things that used to light me up,2022-01-02 01:46:43
6373,i could never quite put my finger on it so i m gonna try and explain the best i can. i  25f  became friends w this girl in hs  also 25f . i also hung out with my older sister  30f . fast forward years later  amp  they are very close friends. i love that for the both of them as they have lots of similarities  amp  i can tell they understand each other on a very deep level. at first it was like we were the 3 musketeers but now   sometimes i don t feel welcomed or like i belong.   i feel like they think of me as lazy or stupid. sometimes they ll say small  jokes  or give each other a side eye look insinuating these things. and sometimes they create this vibe that feels very patronizing .    example  last night i cooked dinner at my parents. i asked my friend to make the rice because i m not good at cooking rice in pots yet. i made everything else or at least i tried to. there were a lot of points where i couldn t tend to the food like i wanted because my friend was too busy trying to do everything. after dinner we went outside to smoke. when we came back in we finished our meals and got ready to watch tv. i was going to get everyone s snacks ready but my friend suggested we put the food away. i was kindve annoyed because i just wanted to relax for a second. i made the damn meal i m not gonna leave it out all night. we start putting it away and long story short she started treating me like idk how to use the dishwasher. her attitude was nasty and condescending. when we were done i went to prepare the snacks. she left the kitchen and shut the lights off while i was still getting things ready. i felt like that was rude so i didn t prepare her snacks and sat on the other side of the couch. her and my sister started treating me like i was being mean. at that point i didn t care anymore. i went to sleep.    some backstory  my sister has a career  my friend doesn t really have anything going on right now in terms of a job or school. i am an exotic dancer.   i think i m responsible  my bills are always paid on time  my credit is amazing  and when i had an apartment it was always clean and stocked.  had to move because my lease was up  still looking for a new place    my sisters lease was up as well. i honestly don t think she is too good with money management. high balances on cards  being overwhelmed w bills  etc. her and my friend shared her place. it was cleaned frequently but was still very dingy. my friend paid no bills. my friend has never held a job down for long. makes her money from govt and sugaring.    i just want to know if i m doing anything wrong  i ve brought it up in the past but they act like they don t know what i m talking about or we will argue. i feel like they get upset because ill admit i can be a procrastinator  but that doesn t mean i won t do the task. we are all supposed to be getting a place together but now i don t know how i feel about that. i don t think they ll give me the space to be the adult i am. it feels like they just want to criticize me. sorry for the long post.,2021-09-23 10:50:23

3846,i just finished the most intense meditation of my life. it s normal for me to connect with strong energy during full moon cycle  though i ve never felt energy with the strength i felt today. within minutes i felt my body sitting inside a bubble of intense energy with no connection at all to the physical plane around me. my subconscious mind seemed to power the bubble around me with subconscious thoughts flashing so quickly i couldn t keep up or focus on any one thing and n particular. it almost felt as if i was in a rapid state of astral projection though my subconscious mind was moving through the universe faster than the speed of light. i have no idea what exactly i was working through or what thoughts we being reorganized  only way i can describe it  but 60 minutes later i slammed back into my physical body being jolted  awake . i trust my subconscious did exactly what was needed though i feel as though had been able to harness the power of that time i would have been able to manifest a life changing experience.   any suggestions on how next time i can harness the energy and experience  anyone else have a similar experience with this blue moon or one in the past they can share ,2021-08-22 19:02:15
88159,as of recent  there have been these terrible thoughts plaguing me that have only gotten worse. i broke down in tears when i discussed this with a close aunt of mine because i needed to let it all out as it  and still is  killing me.  basically  i m depressed over the fact that i have no social life and no girlfriend.  i m a 26 year old virgin who s never a gf before or close friends since middle school. high school years were awkward for me  i had some acquaintances  but not people who i could value as a good friend outside of school projects or chatting during lunchtime. to top it off  my guardian at the time placed me in an all boys high school  so understandably  i never had the chance to meet a potential mate.  i didn t mind not having a gf at the time because i figured it would happen eventually  but as the years passed  nothing came from it and that s where the depression started to surge.  the last straw for me was when my mom told me that both my younger sisters would say some horrible things behind my back. the oldest comparing me to steve carrel s character from  the 40 year old virgin  and the youngest made off hand remarks about me being a loser.  needless to say  this made me feel like complete garbage  my self worth as  a man  in tatters. worse  was finding out that the youngest already lost her virginity to her boyfriend. so  now as the eldest of the three  i m still lonely  with no friends  no partners  while the other two flaunt their body count and social niche while talking shit behind my back.  i was actually trying to do something about this earlier this year. i  was looking up meetups to get out there and meet new people  i was hitting the gym regularly to improve my image and feel proud of my body. but  then this godamn pandemic struck shutting everything down  leaving me stuck indoors unable to do anything about it. dating apps are a joke  and other apps for bf s have given me little results. i m back to square one and i m at the end of my rope here.  i know that sex shouldn t mean that much in the long run  but i sadly live with a group of toxic people who evidently put too much value on your social status and sex life   they ve made that very clear.  i m so distraught and broken from this that i m willing to just pay off a hooker to lose my virginity and finally shut up the mockery   i m dead serious.  i honestly have no clue on how to cope with this anymore. i m open to any piece of advice or kind words someone here can offer. but please  no replies like   don t worry you ll get a gf   or   you ll get a friend soon  . i ve heard that enough times to last me a lifetime.  i just don t want to be a loser anymore or think that there s something wrong with me that nobody would want to associate themselves with me on any level.  i m just so alone...,2020-12-08 12:26:08
106485,i just feel so empty for years now even years back i felt it but unlike now i couldn t put my finger on it  i don t know what to do now i m never happy or in a good mood anymore i always just neutral or down right sad  i constantly feel empty and sad and nostalgic for a better time that honestly never was  nothing helps i m only honestly happy when i m drunk but for a short time i find myself just walking around town smoking a pack of cigarettes just to fill the void   i honestly feel a huge void around my chest and stomach i can t describe the real not pain but just a deep unsettling feeling constantly with me   i don t see it going away i simply can t imagine not feeling like this even with girls and with friend i m constantly shit,2021-01-31 15:46:22
8742,so a while ago me and my best friend had a huge falling out and stopped being friends. after months of not speaking and being friends i had decided to text them and just let them know that i miss them and i m willing to put in work for our friendship to be better and for us to be friends again. they accepted and i thought we were fine. at the end of the convo i asked if we could like have a catch up session and they didn t reply and today was their bday and i wished them happy birthday and they also haven t replied and i know they ve probably seen the text. i know i m probably overthinking but also something is telling me that things aren t okay or moving towards being back on track. am i overthinking  ,2021-11-22 17:43:20
137969,i ve been trying to look for an answer for the past few weeks but i cant seem to completely confirm that i am going through some form of depression.   for context  i m from singapore and i ve been studying in the uk for more than half a year. initially i thought i ll be totally fine since its only a 1 year course  post graduate  and i ll finally have a lot of freedom since i live with my parents in singapore  its pretty common there . but being in an unfamiliar place on top of the covid situation  i ve never felt this lonely in my entire life. i ve spent most of the time in uk in my room. there are still house parties happening now and then but when i do attend them i don t feel good about it at all.   i don t know if this loneliness that i m feeling is extreme but i do feel that my existence is pointless almost every day. like i m easily replaceable and i m one of those side characters that you ll forget about anyways  this is a pretty cringe thought i know . i can t seem to find anyone to talk about this because i feel like other people are going through things that are far worse than what i m going through and i don t want to ruin another person s day by talking about it  i ve always struggled to talk about my feelings and i honestly think my feelings are insignificant to other people s feelings. like i dont  deserve  to feel angry or sad about something because i think the reasoning behind it is just too insignificant and i m really scared of the outcome from sharing these feelings.  i have suicidal thoughts for the past month but i m not sure if its  true  suicidal thoughts because i never actually put it in action and just have  i want to disappear   kind of thought on a daily basis. i ve actually deactivated my social media accounts this month and realized the friends that i thought would care about me didn t even mention about it. deactivating social media accounts actually helped me to get some work done for school work but honestly i m barely functioning  i m either playing games  eat  sleep or doing school work. i ve pretty much abandoned most of my social life.  so anyways i can t seem to gather my thoughts properly and i apologize for the messy writing. but these are some of my thoughts that i can t seem to share with anyone and decided to post on reddit.  what are your thoughts about this  do you think i need to seek help  i think writing these down in a post somewhat calmed me down a bit but the random waves of intense emotions and loneliness gets me sometimes.,2021-06-06 11:18:36

200833,i always struggle to answer this question. sometimes it feels like i m always consumed with sadness and thoughts of suicide. i don t have some tragic trauma that happened to me as a child. i just don t want to be here and overall not happy. but people are always probing asking  did something happen when you were little   or  what is making you depressed  and i never can give a good answer. sometimes i just end up making up reasons that sound  good . anyone else have this problem  it s like i m just depressed without any explanation and i don t have a tragic back story.,2022-01-20 23:11:23

3871,a lot of people hire rollers to try to smooth out their lawns. this is going to do very little to help with a bumpy or uneven lawn.   it might flatten some ant hills and worm castings but it will not get rid of large lumps and bumps and certainly won t do anything for potholes or depressions.   the best way to remedy your bumpy lawn is actually by adding soil sand to the top of the turf and raking it out nice and smooth. do this at least a couple times a year and you ll have a smooth lawn in no time.   the type of soil you should use for this depends on your location  climate and existing soil  but as a rule more sand   more better. i like to mix half sand and half topsoil. it rakes out easily but still has enough organic matter to help the grass fill in quickly.    source  golf course superintendent with 20 years experience.,2021-06-13 22:12:18

156937,in 2016 i started high school and i had a very difficult time. i have lived all my life in a small town  attended elementary and middle school with the same 16 people...so i came from a very restricted social environment  and also very toxic  aparently  as i later realized seeing how many people in my class either developed eds or other disorders or became shitty and mean people .  i was scared  shy and i was not used to make friends with new people. i knew no one in my new class  while some of my new classmates already knew each other and bonded very quickly. i had yet to discover my personalty my interests and all the things that make me a unique person...all my strenghts  were weaknesses back then. i have never been heavily bullied  just casual bullying during middle school and dirimg high school i simply felt excluded and ridiculed.  i became paranoic and whenever i was walking along corridors i felt as if everyone was laughing at me or was judging me and same during the lessons. i had no one to talk to or at least i had bonded with two of my classmates but sure we did not became friends in one day and i wasn t close enough with them to open about a topic as sensitive as this. it was also the time of tumbrl very very toxic portraying of self harm  pro ana etc and i used to see a lot of those contents. i too began to self harm. never cut too deep  but sure i was desperate. i had lost a bit of weight but not a significant amount and fortunately i didn t have to go through what an eating disorder really is. i used to think a lot of controlling my food habits and only assume  like 200 calories in a day  some days i did that but most of the times i didn t follow it through thanks to my parents who kept serving me healthy meals  unsospectingly of the fact that i was obsessing over food restriction  and of course i eat them  with a bit of sense of guilt  but i always ate regularly not in order not to upset them or make them worry for me. this obsession for food and dieting etc fortunately did not last long. the self harm problem continued for a few months longer.  i was casually stopped by the fact that i had a skin rash all over the body and i had to be visited by doctors etc and my parents would often check if my skin got any better. the situation with my skin rash lasted like a month considering dermatologic examinations and allergic tests  during that period i had to control myself and i practically stopped self harming cause i was too afraid that someone would find out. i was nearly at the end of my school year and by that point of i had managed to improve my grades and a teacher of mine started believing in my abilities  later on i became one of her  best  students ..so in order not to  disappoint  my teacher i started immerging my self into studying and i think it may have made the difference. this kept me away from self harm  even if it has not been a linear process. i also stopped scrolling trough tumbrl. most of the times i had ups and downs.  though i stopped self harming the suicidary ideations did not stop but i also started wondering of running away more than committing suicide. with good grades i gained a little bit more of respect from my classmates and also now at least they included me conversations etc. anyway i remember that by the end of the school year i stopped self harm..but the summer has been a long  depressive episode   to make things clear i have never been in theraphy so i have never been diagnosed anything  its just my impression  when i was alone i stayed in bed or on my phone most of the time or watching tv just to hear someone s voice. and when my parents were at home i usually spent a lot of time in my room or told them i was sleepy even if i wasn t just cause i had no strenght to act normal. i just avoided them as long as possible so that they wouldn t notice how i was feeling. i was very irritable too.  now my situation is totally different. i stopped with suicidary ideations. over the years i have bonded with my classmates  i now have friends  had a normal scolastic journey and  i figured out my sexuality and came out to my parents and close friends  and that has been a real milestone for me .  to this day there s another problem  my anger issues. i don t really remember when they actually begun since when i was a child any kind of anger manifestation was considered a tantrum. now its really bad i can t controll myself in any way. my anger issues are undenyable and uncontrollable and i can t keep my parents away from my outbursts even though i try to avoid having fits of anger in front of them.  lockdown has been quite tough for me. i graduated from highschool this year  in my country its 5 years of high school  and this last school year has been very stressful. i had to keep up with the expectations of my teachers and my own  while feeling totally disconnected  from the world.   anger issues and stress management problems apart   i believe i have learnt a lot from these years   im generally happier and have a bit of hope.   the reason why im writing all of this  besides the fact that i needed to vent with the benefit of being anonymous  was to ask you something   was it real or am i making things up    i mean i have never been in therapy...i don t have a term to better understand what i have been through. i would really want to go to therapy but my parents do not prioritize this kind of expense and i don t know...i don t have the courage to firmly ask them to let me start therapy.   to this day i still don t know how much of my self harm problem was influenced by the media i was exposed to  if what i have experienced during that summer was a real depressive episode or if im overdramaticizing everything to feel like i have overcome tougher problems than what the actually were.   whenever i read or listen to someone s story its always like they all found out about self harm without any inflence. they felt the urge to hurt themselves and used the first thing they had nearby.  insetad i already had seen many pictures of self harm before cutting myself for the first time. it has never been an uncontrollable urge  i used to disinfect my razor before doing anything so that i wouldn t catch an infection and have to tell someone what i did. i feel like i have been influenced a lot by that fucking tumbrl   idk... what do you think about it  i promise i won t have a crisis if you tell me that i made all that shit up,2021-08-12 15:43:42
104316,how it feels to be depressed  by james                                                                guilt makes you sad.   sadness makes you calm and tired.    tiredness makes you sleepy.   sleepiness makes you unenergized.     being unenergized leads to weight gain.   weight gain leads to low self esteem.   low self esteem leads to social awkwardness  and self hatred.   social awkwardness leads to less friends  and even lower self esteem.     less friends leads to being less social.   being less social leads to all that was previously mentioned and more.     but the biggest thing it leads to  is depression.      what you have left is self loathing and depression  which both lead to everything becoming worse and worse until you find yourself buried in your own blood  sweat  and tears.   you can t climb out  not by yourself.     you re stuck in the hole you fell into. all it took was a little guilt  and a bit of sadness.   you can t escape it  it gnaws at you until you start to lose your mind   until everything around you becomes meaningless.       you want to escape  you wish you could.      you imagine looking out of your hole to see the sky  the sun s sweet warmth against your face  and the cool refreshing air you can t help but crave.    you imagine seeing your friends all around you  all happy that you re there  and you finding yourself happy that you re there for them  that they re glad you re there.  you imagine seeing the love of your life sitting there  being able to talk for a bit about one another  and when the moment comes to embrace in a kiss . . .    . . . you wake up in your hole of misery once again   the hole of despair for which you will spend the rest of your days trapped in.    you wish you could breathe again  you wish that you weren t crushed by all this pressure  yet no matter how hard you push and push you just end up where you were again and again.     it s like pushing a rock up a hill  only for it to fall down the hill again and again.   you always find yourself in the same situation. everyday you wish you could just get out.     you wish that you could say something.     you wish that the weight wasn t suffocating you to death and slowly draining your life away until you ve become nothing but dust and bones.     you wish you could scream and shout  you wish you could really talk to someone  but you know you can t. you know that if you do the weight will just crush you more.    escape is the only option  but you can t escape by yourself.    escape is something you ve wished for for years now. the wish of escaping has locked away everything that you ve held dear from your childhood   everything you ve loved  but have left behind. everything you wish you still had  but has been lost or withered away.     the pressure is unbearable.     you feel that the weight of the world is on your shoulders  and that you re just not strong enough to lift it  or move it somewhere else.      you can t even muster the strength to ask for help.      this may very well be your tomb  a tomb of sorrow and wistfulness that has caught you like a bear trap. you beg in your mind to be let out  you beg in your mind for you to do something  anything. yet  you don t.    you lay there  unable to move  unable to speak  unable to do anything.    all you can do is think  all you can do is wish. all you want is to leave  and to be unburdened  but you can t.   you can t  you can t  you can t.   it won t let you.    you wish it would. you dream of being somewhere else  of being someone else. you always end up here again to your disappointment.      sometimes it feels it would be easier just to end it all  to let it smother you to death.   sometimes it feels as if it is the only way.      however  these are nothing but thoughts in your mind  never action. never movement of any kind.  you just go with the flow  until . . . who knows      why are you here again   why are any of us here again   why even be here if there s only suffocation and terrible pressure to be had   it seems pointless doesn t it  live to be pressured and crushed. live to be unable to do anything you really want to do.     why even bother doing anything at all when everything you do will just cause you pain      it s a life  but a life not worth living.   you fear  yet beg for what s outside of your hole.     you could think about it all day and all night in your dreams  your daydreams  or in your deepest thoughts.     in the end  you can t summon the courage or willpower to do anything but remain in your hole of misery.   in your trap of helplessness.  in your trap of social discouragement and self loathing.     why      at this point  you ve stopped caring about everything  or anything out there.   you ve stopped caring about anything in your hole of entrapment.    you just can t care anymore   not at least until you start caring again  and start all over.   it s a self fulfilling prophecy of growing as a person only to lose motivation and give up again.   why bother when you could just sleep    sleep till the end of days  sleep until everything just stops.    sleep until everything else sleeps as well.     just go to sleep. ignore the pressure  ignore the pain  ignore everything you hate and loathe.    ignore everything . . .  . . . just sleep away.,2021-01-24 07:00:13
3381,sometimes you can misspeak or fail to address a concern that your interviewer holds  and you won t know it until you fail to get the job. this also gives you something insightful to ask when the interviewer asks you for questions.,2021-06-02 11:28:31
123105,i am 20 years old and i am extremely depressed. i can t even hold down a job because of my anxiety  i have a fear of going outside but i really want a job so i could move out of this house. i have a very toxic family who i hate. i hate to say it but i hate these people. they have always treated me so badly  my mother tells me that she wishes i was never born and my dad is an alcoholic who always yells at me. i have a 38 year old brother who lives with us  he doesn t work  doesn t want to  just does drugs  drinks all day. i can t even get out of my bedroom when he is home because he just yells at me  calls me a loser  calls me gay  he has physically abused me  has hit me  has thrown shoes at me and he tells me things like  i don t know why you hate me so much  i never did anything to you  yet he does this. i try to keep my distance but sometimes he comes into my bedroom and verbally and physically abuses me. i m not happy and i am becoming suicidal. i can t live with these people anymore but keeping a job is just so hard for me because of my anxiety. i just wish life wasn t this hard  i just wish i was happy but i feel like i m just giving up on everything. i ve just been in my bedroom crying.,2021-04-17 16:41:59
4797,does anyone here go through phases where they aren t meditating or especially mindful  but still feeling good  i haven t had the desire to meditate in a while  and while it helped me get here  i don t really see the need to do it right now. i m asking because i typically see this as more of a lifestyle type activity  not something to really go on and off of  ideally.   i d be grateful to here some thoughts on this subject from more experienced folks.,2021-10-19 13:14:39
11543,i like to use this one       i ve done between 6 and 10 hours of research so now i m a fully credentialed epidemiologist .     everyone picks up on the sarcasm.     plus  you get to level set that  internet search doctors  are a joke  and will be treated as such.,2022-01-09 22:20:10
147698,i could improve myself in quite a few ways  but it would be like polishing a turd  because i still wouldn t be good enough. maybe i d go from a 2 to a 3. i m not good enough for anyone   not for friends and certainly not for a partner.     why pick up hobbies  i don t feel like i deserve to smile. why should such an ugly thing like me smile    i don t have any talent  but it would be silly if i did. i can t create anything  because i hate myself and i am ugly  and creating something beautiful would be ironic and would feel like a lie.     i m in my early 20s and i am beginning to bald on the top of my head. if god is real  he has a cruel sense of humor. let s just add that on to how messed up i am already  thanks.     i feel envious of people who effortlessly obtain friendships and relationships. people who have the time of their lives partying  hanging out with friends  hooking up....   things i have never gotten to do. i see everyone all around me feeling good  feeling happy  having fun... and i m just here  feeling shameful about who i am and likely to never experience anything close to what they have on the daily. i wish i could experience it all just once  so i can move on and be done with it. i don t want to keep missing out. i want life to stop laughing at me.     i don t know what to do. even if i do improve i m still never going to be good enough for anyone. ugly  talentless  and stupid. my receding hair is like a clock ticking until i become a truly lost cause anyway. i m bi  so i get to be rejected by absolutely everyone on sight.     i wish things would get better. or that i can wake up one day and no longer care that i m always gonna be alone.     apologies for wasting your time  writing this felt therapeutic.,2021-07-11 09:16:11
15257,a lot of shit has happened  but that does not even matter. what only matters is how i feel right now and i feel confused and like shit. i just want to lay in bed all day  but even that gets boring at some point and then what do you do  i can t even explain properly how shitty i feel so i just use the word  shitty . and nothing terrible has even happened in the last months or so  i just want to go back in time like 2 3 years where things where kind of fine. this is a confusing post i just wanted to vent a bit.,2020-03-20 19:08:54

2997,i heard this advice a few years back and i ve never looked back.  think back to every  regret  you have.   at the point where you made that decision you have to realise that you made the best possible decision for yourself given the circumstances that were present to you at that time.   you will understand you past choices and other people a lot more if you look at it at this way.,2021-05-22 17:02:33
10818,doing an all nighter to reset a screwed up sleep schedule is not recommended  although it can work. our circadian rhythms are linked to our meal times. if you wake up at the time you want to wake up and have a big meal  you are telling your body that it s time to be awake now. conversely  if you eat before bed  your digestive system is active while you re sleeping so you re body is still  working  even though you re asleep.,2021-12-23 22:40:27
4588,i ve been depressed for pretty much my whole life. in high school i was a terrible student and didn t expect to live past graduation. my senior year in high school i tried to kill myself which  obviously  didn t work out.   after that  for some reason  i got my shit together. i enrolled in community college  studied hard  got involved in clubs  and took care of myself. i ended up graduating with all a s and transferred to the university of my dreams. throughout the whole process  my depression never wavered. i kept fighting with the thought that   maybe someday i ll be happy.    i m about a year out from graduating and i ve started spiraling again. i can t motivate myself to study or workout or even leave my apartment on some days. i ve become borderline agoraphobic and gained an embarrassing amount of weight. i have pretty much no friends  and there s not a single person i can talk to about this. my grades have started to slip hard  and i can t make myself care anymore.  i m sick of living for the next day. i m sick of telling myself to fight on  while knowing that i will never truly be happy. i know this feeling will never leave  i think what makes depression so hard to fight is that  in some cases  it s unrelenting. it s like carrying a bag of bricks in that you feel like you can hold it for now  but eventually it will bring you to your knees and you won t be able to get back up. i m starting to feel like i m at that point.  i know i m going to kill myself. it might be next week  next year  or a decade from now  but i know it s going to happen. no pill or therapist can save me  it s just a matter of time. just grateful to have this space to vent.,2020-02-15 12:55:10
43929,i say  depression  like that because i was never actually diagnose and i m not someone to self diagnose myself from what i read online but something just wasn t right with me for a while. i was in my darkest time from the end of 10th grade almost through my senior year. i just graduated a few weeks ago. before that dark period i tried my hardest at everything i did. i got the best grades i could  i played sports for the school and felt motivated and passionate. everything took a turn. i felt all alone. i hated myself. i coped escaped in unhealthy ways. not with self harm  drinking or drugs. for me it was sleep and video games. as dumb as it sounds it s true. it was my escape from reality. my mom isn t always the most present in my life and i don t really have any friends. it got to the point i was playing 6  hours a day. somehow i was still doing pretty solid in most of my classes. as and bs. i would grind during school because i had nobody to talk to but i would not touch schoolwork outside of school. i felt i could be myself online and i actually found people who i became  friends  with online. they got to actually know me and didn t have to judge me by my physical appearance. i m 6  1  155lb glasses wearing ugly ginger kid. doesn t matter how good i take care of myself hygiene wise because my facial features are ugly and i m pretty scrawny. like i said i used video games to cope and i would stay up late so i could be alone. i started actually pondering suicide. never came too close but it was something i was spending a good bit of time thinking about. i was alone and didn t participate in any activities my senior year. i was at my lowest probably 3 months ago.  fast forward to about a little less than month ago now. senior year is coming to a close and i decided i couldn t keep going on like that. it was time for a change. i started finding ways to occupy my time more to take my mind off of bad thoughts. i wanted to try and be better for myself one more time. i ve started and now have been consistently doing things like running  working out  walking my dog more  working full time now  listening to music  reading again occasionally. i haven t been on my video games as much at all lately. i ve been laying off crap food in general more lately. opting for fruits  veggies and water instead of cookies or pop. it s still a struggle to actually feel happy but i have been feeling a bit better or more accomplished lately. i ve been proud of progress i ve made in these areas. how i ve chosen to eat drink a bit healthier and how i am now running a mile in 6 15 after running an 8 00 a month ago when i was getting back into it. how i ve spent more time with my dog.  however i feel like i m starting to slip. i ve been feeling a little less motivated. i start to think what am i even doing it for. i don t care enough about myself to be putting in this effort. i skipped a workout 2 days in a row now and felt guilty. i ve had a pop 2 days in a row now. i ve gotten less than 7 hours of sleep the last 2 days now. i want to feel motivated. i want to learn how to care about myself regardless of how ugly i am. i want to better myself in case there is ever a girl who is into me for some reason. it s just tough putting in this effort when i have nobody to do it for or anyone that notices. i know it s only been a month but i ve been trying to form healthier habits before college and i m already starting to break them. i just need some sort of help  advice  suggestions or motivation to keep me on track and keep my head up. i don t want dark negative thoughts to come back. i ve wasted too much time on tearing myself apart that i want to get better. sorry if this post is pretty incoherent. i was just throwing out thoughts that have been racing through my head. any help is greatly appreciated  thank you ,2020-06-30 02:02:47
61814,my dad is the perfect father anyone can imagine  loving  very intelligent  emotional and normal intelligence   very knowledgable and selfless. he always put family first and regrets some of the decisions he has made in the past that led to him feeling miserable at work because of his co workers and boss  read post history . the problem is  in our family he is depressed as well because of my mother. the fundamentals of their relationship are there  they trust each other  love each other etc.   but it s the  little  things that destroy them. my mom always overreacts over little things  when he accidentally raises his voice sometimes for example  and is unforgiving. she would always bring up things that happened 10 20 30 years ago and weren t even big things back then. this has taken a toll on my dad. in the end  he wants to fight for his family and that s where his heart always is. but seeing him so depressed at work or when he comes home to more stress makes me so sad. he himself even said that he doesn t have much hope anymore for his life since he s already almost 60 years old. he doesn t have energy anymore to do new things and every day he gets up   he is just trying to make the best of it . i recommended him to start new hobbies  go to communities and not always care about the arguments with my mother too much. but he s starting to feel too tired to do that. i don t want to see him this way. this man gave everything in his life for other people..what can i do   edit  my mom is a sahm  she doesn t value social contacts as much as my dad. my dad loves connection and needs friends and the community feeling  but over the years he s lost all of them..,2020-09-04 08:14:18

91, about two years ago  our garage burnt down and we lost everything inside. our insurance provider came by and asked us to fill out forms listing everything that was lost in the fire.  taking a simple photo sphere picture annually can help provide the insurance company with proof of possessions  as well as help you with remembering items that may have been lost inside.  be sure to upload these photos to some form of online storage solution.  note  keep the insurance claim open for as long as possible. typically the max time allowed for claims to be open is 180 days. you may go looking for something later and realize it s been destroyed.,2021-02-08 13:46:37

160568,hello everyone i m new to this community. hope you are having a pleasant day  i get a great deal of suffering on a day to day basis. every time i try to talk to someone  their response feels like silence. they keep working  all obsessed for some worthless trivial trinket  like a badge of honor or some grey ish piece of garbage.   no time to be sincere  laugh or feel  don t even think about an honest heartfelt smirk. if you want to kill time  it better be with gossip  lies or nonsense. here nobody is funny  and frankly it feels just cold. people act cool like it s good  but it s not  it s just cold.  should you attack them with jokes and empathy  they start avoiding questions and pretend you are mistaken. a solution may get them out of their hole  but it s a warm day. it s a warm country after all  a shame everyone likes holes.  nobody is angry  they are too cold for that. it s you who brings confusion  your confused hothead. but it s alright because they know  and they tolerate  and they can help you  and they are in control. but you know better.  anyway  this is getting stupid. the point to this is that i feel kinda impotent and wasted  but it doesn t seem like a description of depression.   i want to do things  have fun and better myself  but everyone around me is just a bummer  and sorta condescending and mean about it. it s like it s just their cover for being a depressed mess with no purpose for anything.  anybody here ever known such a thing ,2021-08-25 17:10:44

152752,i m so damn exhausted of my mind screwing everything up. i m about to turn 30 in a few weeks and although i ve been fortunate enough to have had many women interested in me throughout the years  i just can t seem to hold a stable relationship for longer than a few months. when i was younger it wasn t a huge deal  but now that i m getting older i m beginning to feel i may never be able to develop a long lasting meaningful romantic connection with anyone and it makes me feel so deeply alone.  the thing is  i am able to clearly see how it is me pushing my partners away. once the initial excitement wears off  i go back to being aloof  insecure and self centered and i can sense my masculine essence eroding. i can see how my partners go from being attracted to me to feeling sorry and completely turned off. i don t blame them. i don t want them to carry any of my burdens. i want to own up to them and keep fighting to get better. but with each passing relationship  i just become more afraid of opening up about my mental struggles and having them realize that the confident  fun version of me is kind of a part time deal.  on top of it all  i seem to be developing some kind of body dysmorphia. depression sure seems to have done a number on me physically and it s causing me to age a lot more quickly than my peers. i m rapidly losing my hair  about a third of my beard and body hair is already gray  i have bad eye bags and dark circles and  although i ve tried  i just don t look good completely bald and i ve been told as much by friends. i legitimately hate looking in the mirror most days. i even started dating older women in hopes that it would even things out  but the same thing happened.  my last partner recently left me after i became insecure and started acting weird and it really hurt me because i actually did care about her. but somehow  just a week later  the universe has already put two new women in my life who are showing interest. the thing is  i m seriously afraid of trying this again and screwing it up once more. i don t think my heart can take much more disappointment and i m tired of superficial connections.  i know i need to develop self love and find something to get excited about every time i wake up before i try to find someone again  but the thing is i m also very lost and lack direction in life. the only thing i m truly passionate about is music  and that s just not gonna pay the bills or provide me with the financial stability that a relationship requires. besides that  i m working on finishing a degree in biochemistry  two semesters left   but i have no desire to go to grad school or med school  and the job prospects with a b.s. in that field look bleak.  are there any guys out there who ve managed to be in successful or satisfying relationships in spite of all your struggles  if so  how did you manage  i don t think my depression will ever go away at this point  and i don t want to end up alone or hurting myself and others even further. thank you for reading.,2021-07-29 08:50:58
180101,so after a while investigating i found the way to go as i want. no more failures like the last two times  this will be over quickly and won t be able to pull back and then live with this resentment against me anymore.  some weeks ago i got struck by an idea. a money maker idea. an important one. i thought look  there s something there... i ll tell some people. i told two of my last friends and they liked. i started studying and while doing it depression wasn t there. but any other time... that voice remembering me all the bad i did.   a couple of weeks ago i lost faith on my idea. but my friend thinks is better than imagined. i talk with mom and she agreed. she wants in hahahaha... and today the best idea of my life came to my mind.  i m gonna set the business  as i m the one with the technical knowledge. i will find investors. i will associate with my friends. i will let my mom in. and when all is ready i ll finally will be out. i ll do it myself.  and 3 of the 4 people i screwed the worst during my almost 30 years will receive a profit. one of my friends  mom  and other friend who can t get in but will inherit part of my share. the debt i will contract will be covered by one of my life insurances and the other one will pay for mom s adapted house. i almost cry of joy when i put all the pieces together. my friends who are partners will get a business to take care of his son and his new home respectively. my other friend will find her way out of poverty. mom will get a home and money to keep her health in check. only one won t be restored after being harmed by me  but not having contact and being from other country i m not sure i could get her a part of the business  but will try to give her some other thing to compensate. she may need this jumpstart too.  i finally found some peace  some purpose. the thing that kept me away from the exit is finally getting moved  the need to redeem myself  at least partially. and i needed to get it out of my chest. i ve been so overwhelmed for some weeks that i can t pity myself  or cry  or nothing  just hear the voices. maybe write it up will ease me and give me that back.,2021-11-03 17:46:10
765,i ain t got too much money to spend like these rich folks who go to clubs and get drunk also  i do not understand that kind of enjoyment.  what i really want to do is  i want to form a group of people who know how to chill without spending much money or other resources or by harming self or others.  what better than a group of people talking about life  listening to good music and basically just chilling.,2021-03-11 13:33:20
104082,this is a rant about my psychiatrist  dr 1 . she actually functions as my talk therapist  but because she is an md my appointments with her are covered by my government s health plan.  i recently had several appointments with a new psychiatrist  dr 2  who specializes in adhd to see if i have that  i do . i was required to fill out several questionnaires assessing both depressive symptoms and adhd symptoms and scored highly on both. after our 90 minute phone consultation  dr 2 said he was surprised that i scored so highly on the depressive symptoms questionnaire because i don t  sound depressed  over the phone. however  he took it very seriously and said that we really need to work on the depression in addition to the adhd.  i mentioned this to dr 1 during our next appointment and she was also surprised.   i thought you got over that ages ago   she said. nope  still depressed.  but you recently applied for that new job   depressed people don t have the energy or motivation to do something like that. if you were depressed  you wouldn t have done that .  so  people who show some motivation in some parts of their lives can t have depression  i m pretty sure successful people like doctors and lawyers can be depressed while still doing their jobs and progressing their career.  i applied for a new job  so that cancels out sleeping all day and all night so i don t have to endure the other parts of my life  right   i haven t seen or talked to my friends for years  so i probably can t even call them my friends anymore  but because i showed some initiative to get out of a soul sucking job  that doesn t count as depression   i don t do anything that used to bring me joy  i don t have hobbies or interests  but who cares about that if i sent my resume in   i know i should try to look for a new therapist  but i can t afford it since they re not covered by the government. she has definitely been helpful in some ways  but sometimes she says stuff that gives me such a sour taste in my mouth.,2021-01-23 15:51:44
9124,having a hard time adjusting to a newly long distance friendship  both 26f . have been best friends for many  many years. i love her to pieces but she s a very closed off person whereas i m very open. ever since i moved  approx 1.5hrs away   our friendship has suffered. i try to reach out but don t get much reciprocation. this all being said  i know she s going through a tough time with a few aspects of her life. don t know how to find the balance of wanting to be supportive while also acknowledging that our communication needs to improve. any advice is appreciated ,2021-12-02 00:17:42
8145,i keep seeing a lot of posts about relationships with people which are repetitive  don t apply in general  are only being posted because it happenesd to the op like 30 minutes ago  and worst of all  some of them are too common sense.   lpt shouldn t be about telling people to be kind to others  or about giving advice just because it worked out in your case.   and please for the love of god  don t post the  hr works for the companies and for you  title ever again,2021-10-10 11:56:41
2371,i had a particularly good year at work in 2020 and when we were discussing business for 2021  at the end of the conversation i pointed my performance out to her and asked for a pay rise over and above the generic one that s typically used  if any is awarded at all .  she made a point of telling me she d noted my request and  two months later  presented me with a really decent increase.  the one thing that annoyed me is that she knew i d done really well and  when i asked for the increase  i d have been over the moon if the answer wasn t  don t mention it   i m already on it . why should i have to ask   if i d have asked after the pay review period and she d said  sorry you should have asked me earlier  i d have probably walked out.   don t be one of those bosses  reward staff who go over and above  without them having to come cap in hand. be proactive and caring of them  and they ll go over and above for you.,2021-05-06 10:18:15
18941,idk if any students here can relate but online school is surprisingly worse than normal school. i feel like there s so much more work than usual and it s just increasing each week. i tie all my worth to my grades academic achievements which makes this even shittier. i have no motivation to get work done simply because i feel no sense of accomplishment. once one assignment is finished there s 10 more taking its place. all my teachers act like they care about our health and well being yet assign triple the workload. i understand that it s to make up for the lost class time but this is just ridiculous. on top of that they re grading extra hard meticulous so there goes my grades. tbh  at least in my school district  online classes seem to be harder than most universities  ik because i ve talked to college students about their classes workload . it sucks being in a competitive school sometimes. it s so frustrating because i can t separate my work and chill time space anymore. these past three weeks have taken the biggest fucking damage on my mental health. the icing on the cake is that i was genuinely starting to feel better. i just wanna die and be done with life. i m so fucking over everything.,2020-04-03 04:01:54
12163,as a kid  this is any teenager or adult. as a teen  this is any adult. as an adult  this is anyone asking you for advice in an area you know nothing much about.  if they really want advice or help  they would seek out someone who is clearly experienced in the area that is giving them trouble. a doctor for diagnosis  a counselor psychologist for mental health and emotional issues  an accountant for money trouble etc.  seeking out someone who is obviously out of their depth and constantly asking them to help solve their life problems is just a way to find excuses for immature behavior  or to unload up their emotional burdens without having someone tell them the truth of their situation. trying your best to help them anyway is just enabling their behavior.,2022-01-27 11:43:18
95380,i had a realisation the other day that it s been ten years of feeling this way. i feel weighed down constantly by it. it consumes my thoughts and brings my whole mood and soul down. it feels like being pulled by gravity. i lack any energy or motivation to do anything and i force myself to go to work and pretend to be okay when i m not. i lost the most important person to me and my depression has gotten even worse  i didn t think it was possible. i think about them all the time and it makes me want to cry all the time. my chest is always tight and i m completely heartbroken. there are all these people around me and i still feel so alone. i feel empty and dumb and inconvenient and broken and just dead inside. i m beyond fatigued by my depression and i absolutely hate the way it makes me feel about myself. i hate who i am  i hate what depression has made me. i think about dying every single day. i m hurting myself and i just have no desire to continue living. i m just going to be stuck in this same tunnel of misery and i can t find a way out. there s no one who can help pull me out. i ve been abandoned by everyone i ever let close to me. i ve been hurt in so many ways by so many people  i would never wish my pain on my worst enemy. i feel like i try so hard to do everything right and to make sure no one feels as lonely as i do  i m always willing to listen and support  i wish i had that someone. i feel stuck in time  running out of time  and always running late. i can only do so much without completely going into a mental breakdown and i ve already had 15  within the past week. i am just so exhausted. i want it to be over. give my life to someone who is much more deserving and grateful. i d rather someone else living happy than me living in absolute misery. i just want to die,2020-12-29 13:39:11
99,i currently work a customer service job from home  tech support . a lot of people seem to think that by being total jerks  making rude and condescending comments  or being a smart ass that i will cower down and treat them like a king queen. you will get the bare minimum from me if you treat me this way. i will do my job and be polite  however if i know a way to resolve your issue and you re being a total jerk  i can simply say that i cannot resolve your issue because of  xyz . also  i am literally required to ask how people are doing today. if i don t  i have to have a meeting with my boss. it s rare thang god  but the people that say  don t f cking ask me how i m doing  just answer the question.  a  you re taking up way more of your sweet  sweet time than if you would have just said  fine  and moved on.   also  if people are asking you questions to try to resolve your issue  please just answer them  even if they seem irrelevant. i have to ask certain questions as part of a troubleshooting process. i m not the ceo of the company  therefore i follow the designated steps to resolve issues. i have people say  i m not answering that. do you understand my issue          anyway  catch more bees with honey folks   just saying. and acting disrespectfully to someone that is trying to help you does not help you at all.,2021-02-08 15:40:36

97644,my s.o. gets extremely distressed when he sees me in pain. while he tried his best at first  he started to say things like  i can t handle the ups and downs anymore  as in a  i m going to break up with you if you don t cut this out  kind of way.  last night i broke down crying during one of my depressive episodes and he ended up yelling you have to cut the bullshit. i began to hyperventilate from the shock of what he had said...he then responded by saying   see  you have to stop this.  he apologized right after  but i don t think that wound will recover anytime soon.   i m not looking for answers or advice  i just want to know i m not alone in feeling so alienated from your loved ones  in feeling like you have to carefully keep your depression hidden away or else  they ll abandon you.    please keep in mind that i have excluded significant details regarding my situation to keep this short  thank you everyone.,2021-01-04 17:39:05
188109,ima keep it short but whenever im alone or not distracted by anything i sometimes just feel sad. i get that wierd feeling when im arguing with myself about something and cant come to a conclusion. im not sad when doing things or with friends. idk. i mean it may be puberty cos im not always sad. when i go out with friends i genuinly enjoy myself. its just when i think about life i just get sad. recently i went from normal school to homeshooling and thats maybe why im stressed which causes sadness. im worried cos i cant for the life of me muster up the social skills to talk to someone let alone a therapist. ima just hope its puberty cos god i would hate speaking to a therapist.  well that wasnt too short but hope someone can help.  also if it isnt depression then how can i decrease the amount of times i get sad.,2021-12-01 15:21:21
1325,due to the fact that new apple cpu m1  is much better people individual owners and stores  will probably try to get rid of intel based ones. maybe even try to use some  insane  discounts.  not saying that you should not buy one  but beware that in a year or so there will be much much faster models available currently apple only has 1  midrange  cpu  m1  but they will slowly fully cover their lineup with own cpus   so you can either wait or buy now  but then be sure to get a good price.   amp  x200b   p.s. difference in perf is not small  m1 is much much better than intel cpus,2021-04-03 11:12:44

9272,pretty simple  change your registration when you move somewhere so you can vote in your next election. often times it is the last thing people think of until you try to request a ballot or go to the polling booth. it is pretty easy to do and doesn t take much time.,2021-11-08 22:47:42
188495,i hate it here. i m an idiot and i hate school but what is my life worth if i can t get this god damn degree. it s one more class and i might fail and have to retake or i take an  incomplete  and either way i hate myself.   i m already on meds and in therapy and i was doing so well but my self worth is plummeting and it s like it snuck up on me   it s the same pattern every time but it always sneaks up on me somehow. what the hell am i taking these meds for if i still have to deal with this garbage in my brain. i feel like crying but if i cry i ll have to explain to my parents why i m upset.   just a few days ago i was so assuring too   yeah  school is going fine   but then  now i only alternate between this pit in my stomach and  everything will be ok i think   but i just want to toss myself into the void and not exist for a while. sorry i know no one wants or needs to hear about mundane stream of consciousness from a young adult who can t get her shit together. it s all my fault and i wish i were better. school really triggers this dark mood in me and i don t know what to do and i m sorry. ignore this post if you want. i just want to cry and sleep.,2021-12-02 22:09:42
936,a common mistake is to pump many times  especially when you got so used to it that you can t smell it yourself anymore.  if you don t mind using an antiperspirant  use a neutral  no smell  one on your shaved armpits. 1 2 pump of a super expensive perfume   cologne. that s how fancy lads smell.   the right cologne for the right person  is bs. just get one that people commonly like and you like. e. g.   acqua di gi     many boss brands for men.,2021-03-13 16:37:28

2569,usually when i ask people   how short can a meditation be   they typically laugh because they think i m making a joke   and so i ll chuckle along and play it off as a joke too. but really  i know there are quick meditations people can do throughout the day. i suppose taking a pause and counting down from ten to clear your head  amp  emotions. but what about just a deep breath... i suppose embedded in my question is  the definition of meditation  in which case maybe i don t need others to define it for me.    that was a question  sure. ,2021-06-13 22:48:22
101856,it s never enough. i need more. i have some good things in my life but i m always looking for the next distraction. the next exciting new thing. i dream of another baby  puppy  kitty  house  life. but in the end nothing is changing. i m still me. i can t escape myself with something shiny and better. i got weight loss surgery 2 years ago. got a complication was really sick in the hospital a few weeks. how i dreamed i d lose all the weight and feel so much better. but now i have no more hope because i gained a lot of it back anxiety eating during covid. don t judge me. my brain is broken  no one has any idea how hard it is for me to just walk the dog everyday. never worked. i was heading toward driver s lisence but now i can t practice with all my anxiety. trying to isolate b c my risk factors for covid. upstairs neighbors complain all the time if my kids make noise. not much i can do they are kids. my husband is looking at a screen most of the day instead of interacting. so fucking done. i have the ability to be happy sometimes but never in january. it s my after xmas crash. if i didn t take my meds i could be suicidal or hypomanic but with them i m a little numb.,2021-01-17 01:52:57
92372,so throwaway for obvious purposes  i m 19 years old and a few months back  i was on a dating app meant primarily for casual flings and i matched with a bunch of people. most were bots  some were scammers  some were real people i just didn t click with  etc... you get the point. some people  i sexted with  what i fucking hate myself for is that one of the girls i matched with was 17 and we exchanged nudes. i knew she was 17 but i just went with it. i have never sexted before this app  let alone do it with a 17 year old  and i haven t done it at all since. i ve since deleted the app. i didn t do this because she was 17  but rather in spite of that. i have no contact with her at all because it was just a random match  since then i ve just been absolutely sick to my stomach about my actions. most days i just feel like a fucking predator because of what i did  and i feel like this will be a mental  scarlet letter  i ll have to carry to my grave.   honestly though  i think i deserve to feel like shit because of what i did.  i can t imagine what would happen to me if anyone i knew found out  and while that isn t my primary concern  it just scares me somewhat to think about it. i m mostly just ashamed guilty disgusted sick whatever with myself and my actions.  if you ve made it thus far  thanks for reading. not suicidal  but i just don t know what to do. i feel like i deserve to feel depressed anxious guilty  but part of me just wants it to stop no matter how much i do deserve it.,2020-12-20 13:50:55
96733,so basicly  all my life i consider my self very socially akward  boring and pessimistic. naturally i couldn t fit into any group or maintain any solid friendships from my childhood or highschool. generally people don t want to spend time with me or hang out with me because i couldnt bring table anything than negativity. and i don t blame them for this. they all have other friends that they can enjoy spending time with more than with me. so now i have maybe  2 3 friends that i talk regularly but they too have other friends and we don t hangout that much anyway.  and i m sure they don t care about me as much as i care about them. i am just another friend that they want to do something when no one is around. so yeah im 22 years old  going 23 this year and i miss the opportinities to make life long friends.  everyone s friends list is full   everyone has very close friends they have known since childhood or from highschool. so yeah i have no chance against them. i feel so lonely all the time  and seeing friend groups when i go outside makes me feel more lonely and depressed. i have no motivation to do anything anymore,2021-01-02 09:29:42
127146,if you re talking to someone with a mental illness  or illnesses   please understand that our frame of mind is already fragile  amp  we re most likely vulnerable. screaming at us doesn t help. throwing our mistakes in our faces doesn t help. belittling us for not knowing doesn t help. none of that is helpful at all and it actually makes us feel worse. then people wonder why we don t reach out for help. because for what  so we can get treated like shit over things in our mind we can t control  tough love might work on some people  but not all of them. think about what you say and the way you say it before you start tearing us down to  build character  or whatever you think you re doing to  help  someone that s already struggling.,2021-04-30 17:16:39

141424,after 14 months of crying and hating myself over letting her go  i finally feel like i can let go. the moment i realized i needed to move on was when my best friend told me  if she doesn t see you in her future  why are you upset .   everyone who s upset over an ex  please listen to those words. trust me it helps. y all don t need to stress and hate yourself over a person who could care less about you.  i hope y all become the best version of yourself and find someone who actually sees a future with you.   lt 3,2021-06-18 22:38:11
154990,i had my first year of college last year  and i think it s safe to say most people thought it sucked. however  and i know this sounds dramatic  but something just broke me last year. i had a plan going into college  maybe not a solid one  but it was something. i wanted to socialize  study  just have a new experience. but after last year  having to suffer through a shitty online class system  and seeing my mental health just drop  i ve done a little thinking.  i don t really have any passions in life. there s not really a lot of things i would consider myself passionate about  and even less so that i can turn into something i could monetize. the only thing i can think of is art and illustrating  but honestly  i actually don t really know if i want that to be my career. yeah  if i can grow popular online and do commissions as a side gig  i d love that  but i really don t wanna risk tainting one of the few things i still love to do by going into  the industry and turning that into a career. i ll be honest. i actually think i would be much happier just doing a regular 9 5 job than going into a major industry like medicine or something. i don t really want to be rich or famous. i just want enough to be content in life. my own home  bunch of video games and other nerd shit that i d kill to have  and idk  a cat or something. i just don t really know if i wanna go through the entire process  only to end up with just a paper in a thing i don t want and a bunch of money in debt.  obviously this is a huge decision  and i haven t made my final choice yet. honestly  i m terrified to even bring this up with my parents cause i feel like this will just make them even more mad and disappointed. i ll bring this up with my therapist next time  and maybe at least try to explain myself to my parents.  i just genuinely don t know if college is even for me anymore. even if i end up missing put on a bunch of experiences  i just don t know if it s worth it in the end.,2021-08-06 00:39:03
8098,it doesn t matter whether this is morally wrong. the tip here is how to deal with feeling like you are getting mixed signals. if someone continually declines your invitations  doesn t respond to your texts for long periods  or tells you they want to do something else without you  including being in a relationship   no matter how nice they are about it  now much the flatter you  you really should take them at face value.   stepping away from a situation where you are getting mixed signals rarely turned out poorly. it gives the other person room to do things at their own pace  which might be not at all  in which case  there is your answer .,2021-10-08 16:42:43
126252, on mobile  sorry  panic attacks  depression  lack of motivation  panic attack  depression  lack of motivation.  so much to do... so much to desire  yet i can t get things going. i want friends  yet dunno how to make them from acquaintances. i feel so stupid and worthless  and when my mood brightens  again  rinse and repeat.  therapy doesn t help  and i feel too embarrassed to reach out to others. i m a manic waste of resources  and i wish to burn alive... though it d be too late. i don t know what happened to me  i wasn t always like this  and yet i am now. i wish i could function  at least well enough to learn how to drive...  i m 30 years old  21 years in a depression  18 in mania... i just want to be normal  loved  heard. at this point  it feels like a pipe dream.,2021-04-27 17:46:49

154323,i have my friend over and today my social anxiety has been horrible to the point where it s making me depressed. i ve been trying everything to convince myself that i m alright but i m not and i feel like i m bringing my friend down. i told him that i don t feel well and that i want to lay down and he was cool about it but i feel very bad and don t know how to deal with it.,2021-08-03 21:01:11
93632,for quite a few months now  maybe because at 16 i m becoming more and more aware of how life works  of how good life cannot happen without a bad life  how you cannot be really happy if you don t experience really bad shit  i ve felt powerless against my parents  my friends and pretty much against everyone. i literally cannot tell the others how sad i feel everyday because i would ruin their mood and i would feel much shittier for that. my parents don t give a shit about what i want  even though i decide to help them here and there  lend them money  that apparently they won t give back even if they got them  and be a good child  they re selfish  they hit me for the smallest mistakes and when they start a fight over even the smallest shit i feel worthless and i just wanna die. i m seeing alot of people have a good life winning money  winning good things physically and mentally  having luck with parents and money etc  while i sit here trying to make 50 euros from 12  yes csgo  i m looking at you  and end up with a major failure. i cannot kill myself because that would leave the ones that know me in great pain but i also don t want to exist anymore  as life is just suffer to gain a happy moment then suffer more until happiness can return randomly. i m pretty good at video games  my friends told me that aswell  but that makes me feel more trash  knowing there s no point in being good at your passion if your parents don t give a fuck and start shit like  pause your game  when i play an online game or make people wait for me while i m my parents  slave for buying and getting and helping them. i.... uh.... really don t know....,2020-12-24 10:42:36
81291,i m 13f and honestly just writing this post makes me feel like i m some attention seeking karma whore by itself.  though i felt like i should leave this here i guess. no one will probably read it though.  recently i ve been really depressed and kinda suicidal   of course there s millions of people going through worse things than me and i m probably being very overdramatic but my best friend started bullying me around 7th grade  i still wanted to be his friend but he kept either avoiding me spreading rumours about me  or shitalking me to everyone else.   i am not kidding when i say i literally only had one friend. but i barely hung around him either cause everyone would bombard me with simp wouldnt even let me speak to him without constant insults being thrown at me.  so just having a toxic best friend and getting low key bullied gave me depression. i know  petty as fuck.  i really don t wanna be depressed anymore  but i don t wanna put in the effort to stop being depressed. i just can t bring myself to try so hard to be in a mediocre state of life for the next 70 years it sounds like such a drag to live.  i didn t ask to exist. i don t want to exist. they say suicide isn t the answer but nothing else feels like the  answer. improving myself and holding on does sound like the  right answer  but i just can t be bothered to put in the effort to keep on living.  i have a great life  but i just don t wanna exist anymore were all gonna die anyway and no one will remeber me in the long term either way i m not reall important so why do i have to drag along life.  i know i don t have it in myself to commit to be honest. i m too scared to do anything and can t find a good painless way to go  but i d really like to die right about now.   thanks random redditor for reading through my wall of text.,2020-11-17 23:19:59
146193,i never thought i would pass high school  the problem is that. now i am a 20y who suffers with ocd  anxiety and depression  who barely take my meds  and smoke too much weed. i work to only live  smoke and buy meds when they re over  i sleep one day home one day in friends house  i don t feel wanted in any of those places. i don t know where my life is leading me  i dont have strenght to study.  i know i have to fight for a future  but i never thought i would be alive at this point of my life  my plans  were to be dead before my 20 s. i feel my only safe exit is suicide  the only things that make me feel barely alive are work  weed  and my lil brother. i dont think i will live longer than that.,2021-07-05 21:25:51

2299,granted this is very contextual but generally a good tip in my opinion for people who will have to make this decision soon. it is something you ll hear quite often that living with friends  etc. often result badly.   personally i usually had good experiences until around graduating college. people in my experience change a bit generally then from what i can gather. every single time i ve had roommates   amp  they were all close friends  from then on there were just problems  especially regarding money around time to move out.  ultimately i don t think adults are really made to live together  everyone lives in different ways  amp  often times you can be taken advantage of financially if you don t have a real backbone for getting into drama.   by all means do what is best for you financially but i think if you can start living independently early you ll benefit a lot from that.,2021-05-04 11:23:25

159254,so my life hasn t been going completely awful. i haven t been feeling completely great though either. before a couple months ago  i couldn t develop romantic feelings for anyone for about 2 years after a stupid  toxic 1.5 yr long relationship. i met someone and tried to keep my guard up but i was still so distraught when i found out he went to school out of state  i was completely oblivious though maybe i shouldn t have been   and didn t want a long distance relationship  basically  he never wanted a relationship to begin with. i spent a month hanging out with this guy and i truly felt like it was something that would last  and whatever that it didn t but why the fuck did i deserve this.  for months before this i had been doing so well mental health wise  the resulting emptiness and loss feeling was the last straw. after so so so so long i felt like i had gotten some good in my life that i deserved  and it blew up in my face. now  i m sitting here a month after he never responded to my last text wanting to know why. i hate myself for feeling this way because why do i care about a month long relationship but at the same time  sometimes it s all i can think about. maybe it s not even the relationship  it s just the fact that i lost something that i felt like could be so good. also do i lose dignity for telling this dude that he sucks.,2021-08-21 00:47:15
1006,you write about yourself and post it online  hoping to get or make some new friends online as you fed up of being lonely. and suddenly people start responding to you  and by the end of the day you get hundreds of friend requests from many people across the globe. you are very happy at the particular moment and you start talking to them. but suddenly you get to know that the chats have ended with the people even before less than 10 conversations with them. people stop replying to your texts and they no more are interested to speak you       .....  frankly speaking this has happened to me for more than 30 times    ....,2021-03-29 11:32:03
151665,i feel so worthless. i ve given up on myself. i m 19. i m in college and my grades are decent  but i have no job  no friends  no license  and no activities. i am taking a summer class right now and i have completely given up on even attempting to do well in that. i suffer from ocd and there are so many compulsions i feel like i need to engage in at the moment that i feel like i can t even do them. which is maybe good  but the obsessive thoughts are still there. my family doesn t give me the support i need because they do not understand nor do they care enough. i feel like i have no one and nothing. i m not in good shape physically.   but i want to change that. i see people who are so happy and successful. how can i be like them  where do i even start  i just feel like i m so far from happiness and success that i can never reach it. is there a method ,2021-07-25 11:57:51
200845,yesterday i yelled at my mom  making her cry. in the moment i was unreasonably pissed off and took it out on her. we went out to get food because she just got back from the hospital  my grandmas in the hospital and my mom goes up to see her often  some days i don t even see my mother because she s at the hospital  and at first it was fine. we got the food and she handed me the carrier that had the drinks in it. i was trying to get them out of the carrier but i couldn t fucking get them out and eventually i did by forcefully yanking them out. i said  this is really pissing me off  but my mom mistakes it for me saying  you re really pissing me off  which for some reason made me angry and i snapped at her and yelled  no everything s  about you  we both went silent after that. at the moment i didn t feel sorry because this miscommunication happens very often and it s so often it makes me angry. so i guess this time i tipped over the pot. i haven t been able to think about anything else  i feel horrible i ve made her cry so many times over the past year to the point where her crying doesn t seem to affect me anymore which makes it all the worse. i hate how her crying doesn t make me feel sad or remorse  it just makes me angry. i want to apologize but i just can t.,2022-01-21 00:09:57
10982,instead of buying wrapping paper which is always exorbitantly expensive and gives you minimal product  go to the dollar store and buy a paper table cloth.  they often come in several patterns  are way cheaper and give you several metres so you don t have to buy multiple or spend  15 just to wrap a big present.,2021-12-27 23:45:06
152844,about 2 months ago  i made the perhaps unwise decision to taper myself off of effexor. it kind of worked but the hal life is ridiculously short and god forbid you miss a dose. also the sexual side effects. after a slow taper down and then right into 3 weeks of hell  i m back to base line me which is a shit show. not able to concentrate on my job and lost it. my anger and rage are back  i ve done lots of therapy but it s still there . it s a mental illness but also emotional.    amp  x200b   just got a new shrink and was prescribed 25mg of lamictal to start. no rash or nasty side effects yet. i m really hoping this one works because i hear it s better than ssri ssni for side effects  weight gain  etc. for now  i have to take a lot of cbd and gabapentin. this sucks. it s 100  inherited and biological and no amount of exercise  meditation  diet and skill building can fix it.,2021-07-29 17:02:33

202074,disclaimer  i no longer self harm i ve been clean for 3 4 months now and i m proud of myself tw  self harm i went through self harm since i was 12 or 13 to 17. it s been a very long struggle and i had to be on around 5 different anti depressants because of things like this and suicide attempts. everytime i would get my hands on those disposable razors i would cut them open and take the razors out. at one point i had over 50 in a bottle and my mom found it. she dumped them out all over the kitchen counter and just told me i better quit with my bs. after a couple weeks i started collecting them again. i ve been trying to clean my depression room since i haven t touched it in 3 or 4 years now. haven t cleaned literally anything and it s awful. i found my old bottles and i instantly started trembling and it was almost like i could feel the blood running down my legs again. i m just sitting here trying not to cry. i don t know why i still have them and having them just causes me more stress but for some reason i just cannot bring myself to throw them away.,2022-01-25 21:21:42
118815,around a month ago i randomly thought about death. i ve never been concern with dying but i think recent changes in my life and getting older have changed that. i suddenly realized i am actually very concerned with dying and aging. not being religious or believing in any kind of afterlife is stressful. the idea that time marches on and there is nothing i can do to stop it and one day i and everyone i know will cease to exist terrifies me whereas i used to not care at all. i ve also been experiencing a lot of disassociation recently. sometimes i feel like i m watching my surroundings on a screen rather than really experiencing them. i feel hollow and as though nothing is of any real consequence. i just wake up everyday and go to work and go to school but i just feel empty. i recently play night in the woods and unexpectedly related to the main character who said one day things just didn t seem real anymore. whatever feelings you had towards stuff in your life vanish and everything just feels like shapes. i feel like everything around me is just nothing more than shapes. anyway i hope whoever is reading this is doing well. i m sure i ll snap out of this existential crisis eventually and return to my normal sadness and apathy but for now i suppose i need to cope with it however one does that. thanks for reading i guess.,2021-03-30 18:05:47
80449,i just want to get so far away from everyone and everything. i feel like nothing is working the way it should  and i have lost interest in almost everything. even music which has always been such a huge part of my life just feels like too much work. i ve tried hanging out with friends  but i get anxious  feel uncomfortable  and want to home immediately. it s like all i want to do is just lay in bed.  school is absolutely exhausting to go to every day. i spend an hour in bed starring at nothing and dreading the fact that i have to get up  only to have to stress to get ready in 10 minutes. when i then finally get to leave  i have to go to work.  i feel so trapped in a constant cycle of apathy and stress and i have no idea how to break it.  my parents are divorced so i move from house to house. i spend the majority of this time at my moms place  10 14 days   but i hate it and can t really do anything about it. i feel like it is just contributing to the shit thats going on right now  and i need a break. my mom has become extremely guilt tripping and the few times i ve tried to tell her how i feel  in the hopes of getting some comfort or help  she makes it about her or simply tells me i should feel bad for feeling the way i  when others have it worse. i can t even ask to be some more with my dad  since she takes everything personally  and i can t carry the weight of her emotions as well right now.  on top of this my anxiety has been getting a lot worse  and with that my cutting with every attack... i have an aunt in madrid where i used to be able to go visit for a week or two  but with corona even that is out of the picture.  i just feel like there is no way for me to distance myself or get some time to breathe. i have nobody to talk to  and i just want to be taken seriously without people thinking i am looking for attention.  please help me get out of this before it gets worse.,2020-11-15 14:55:38

871,thoughts want your attention  they feed on it. the more attention you give thoughts  the more they come around and basically audition for your attention. if you watch your thoughts you ll notice that there are certain thoughts which repeat themselves over and over again through out the day  and it s usually negative thoughts. why is this  well  these thoughts keep coming because you keep being seduced by them. you keep feeding them with your attention. thoughts are kinda like pigeons  if you feed them  by giving them attention  they keep coming back  and they even bring their friends. but once you stop giving them attention  and instead just watch them in a detached and indifferent manner  they ll stop coming because you re not feeding them anymore. this is called  the art of watching.  https   open.spotify.com track 4kuawcp3nvjydlo6fnwjoo si 70636b4bc8a4411e ,2021-03-16 07:20:26

52990,  i hurt myself earlier. i looked up my ex on social media that i usually avoid at all costs.. i knew it would hurt and i did it anyway.   i suspect he married recently. good for him. but this is the vile piece of scum that forced teenage me into pregnancies that i was too young and depressed to want. this is the man that kicked me out of the house in the middle of the night. keeping my children who i barely knew because i was so far up my own ass in depression.  i could so easily kill myself. i am a nurse and i hate every single second that i m alive. that is so pathetic isn t it.,2020-08-01 19:04:06
63382,life can be so cruel for some people. i ve just lost my gf of 3 years relationship  due to stage 4 breast cancer. i ve accompanied her until she passed away in just only 1 month last august  since she was diagnosed with the stage 4 cancer. the worst reality for me personally is that her death just coincided two days right after my birthday  26th august .   i ve actually been diagnosed with severe depression  and not only that  but also most likely i ve had severe anxiety  anhedonia  depersonalization  existential crisis depression  etc etc  and even suicidal too. added to all of these with a sense of failure  amp  regrets at my current age now  38 . even if i ve been somewhat privileged financially  but it s still really hard to go through all of this everyday  when my mind is broken like this.   i m not a religious person  although i was raised as a christian. i am now more of an atheist  or at best just an agnostic. and not only that  i m also a nihilist now  and even more i m a pessimist  try to look up or google about pessimism philosophy .   so when my gf just passed away barely two weeks  all i can feel is just even much more depressed  destroyed  crushed  broken  sad  angry  emotional  feeling empty  suicidal  and even losing all hope  energy   amp  motivation to go through everyday. i also feel deep regrets for not being caring  amp  loving enough when she was still alive.   since i m an  reluctantly  atheist  unfortunately sadly  i don t have any luxury like most majority of people who can easily just  move on  simply by just thinking that she  my gf  is now already in heaven  or  in a better place   and all those religious spirituality cliches.   i see this life  world  existence   amp  reality as terribly dark  cold  harsh  cruel  unfair  meaningless pointless  and depressing place  even much more now after my gf is gone. i don t know how i can go on anymore  honestly. i don t even know what to do anymore now. all hope seems lost  and the cruel reality has destroyed  amp  crushed me. if only suicide was easy  painless  then maybe it s better than this life.,2020-09-10 07:39:26

9102,we recently went on what was supposed to be a relaxing weekend trip to new orleans that turned into a nightmare thanks to hurricane ida. we were stuck there for 4 extra days. i had purchased the  35 travel insurance through expedia  and i am so glad that i did. i got refunded for all the extra expenses that we incurred   gas  hotel rooms  flight changes  etc  and then some. i am going to always pay for travel insurance now. you really never know what might happen.,2021-11-04 08:13:38
8802,small businesses are the best place to work. if you find one that is hiring  take it  they have a dream to accomplish. large corporations that have been around for a while or are owned by holding companies are usually just looking for profit and see you as a profit machine. a small business owner will appreciate everything more and your opportunities for advancement are greater because you are closer to a decision maker than the beurocracy of a corporate run office will allow,2021-10-26 23:38:52
138121,lost an amount more than what i could earn in 2  years last year in the stock market where pretty much everyone made bank.  i m getting massive anxiety and panic attacks and can t cope. it s been 7 months and yet my mistake haunts me day in and day out. had suicide ideations and found comfort in being able to have that as a last resort but i ve since come to realize i can t even do that until i right this wrong. my family deserve at least that much for putting up with a fuck up like me. i can t just leave and saddle them with my debts. my parents bailed me out and i ve set them back a few years from their retirement. problem is i m so depressed i can barely leave my room much less start earning the money back. worse still is that i ve learned nothing from my mistake and lost even more chasing the losses. the pain  it s too much. i don t have any way out and can t even off myself. i guess i deserve it for fucking up like i did  will have to live with this huge guilt hanging over me for the rest of my days.,2021-06-06 20:21:53
84710,hey uh  it s my first day on reddit so idk how things work here but i just wanted to rant a little bit about school i apologise in advance for any grammatical mistakes  english is not my first language . it s driving me insane. it s really easy for me to get distracted during online classes. and our teachers  they keep overloading us with assignments. our maths teacher gave us a 20 paged assignment which was due in 2 days..not only that  we re already getting a shit ton of assignments from other classes. it s literally all over the place  i don t know to deal with it. we have to sit in front of a computer screen for hours...my attention span has weakened really severely. plus we got 3 class tests on the same day and a lot of assignments that re all due this week. i don t feel like doing anything. i feel so physically drained cause of school. i just want to kill myself. i hate online school.,2020-11-28 03:40:42
156778,i ve been struggling a lot lately mentally. i m been having pretty negative thoughts recently  and it s been truly difficult. but recently i met this guy for whatever reason really likes me. he seems to truly care about me. we just met  much he keeps messaging me everyday throughout the day until i go to sleep.   i want to give him a chance  but it s just me  and my self loathing. i feel like i don t deserve for someone to care for me the way this guy does. i know what i m doing is wrong but i just can t bear to pull him into this whole mess.    if anyone has any advice please reach out  i don t know what to do. all i feel is guilty and worthless.,2021-08-11 23:48:16
142407,i just finished high school for good in may  and i regret so much. now i have nothing to do so i just lie in bed all day  till i have to go to college . i wish i appreciated high school more  so many people cared for me  and it was just safe away from having to go to college and careers.  i wish i talked more to teachers and friends  i didn t because i was constantly worried about everyone hating me. it feels so silly now  because looking back that obviously wasn t the case at all. it was a dark time  i was so depressed and literally thinking  i ll kill my self next week  all the time. i wish i had just talked to someone about how i felt. i had no friends and all i would do in my free time was play computer games  the only time i would leave the house was when i would go to school.  i wish i took art or sewing for gcses  but i did nt because i was too insecure. now i have to take cooking at college because i need gcses to do courses  so its my only option.  it just makes me want to generally die. i wish i could lose my memory sometimes so i wouldn t have to think and regret everything so damn much.  sorry about alll the typos  typing was really laggy for some reason,2021-06-22 10:56:14
3433,i have been experiencing issues with breathing meditation  i have done them plenty of times but it s always hard for me to do them because whenever i turn my attention on the breath it s hard for me to breathe. i m wondering if someone experienced this too  the problem isn t with my posture  it might be connected to my breathing problems in real life  but they re not some health condition it s only that if i think about breathing i find trouble doing it  sometimes it feels like i m choking for a while  and it s same in meditation of course. ,2021-07-28 08:34:06
164678,hey  i think i m reaching my end soon. it s not because i don t have friends or i don t have money etc. it s just because i don t see a point of living. we haven t found a way to live forever yet and we won t be able to do it in next 100 years for sure. so what  we just live and then die after 60 80 yrs  what s the point. i don t know about you guys  but i m sure that there s no god or afterlife. yes i m an atheist. so that s it guys. you have my points. i ve read many posts and still i didn t found a good reason to live some years knowing that i ll die someday. so maybe could you guys leave some painless suicide methods in the comments     ,2021-09-09 10:25:49
27034,today my boyfriend and i fought. we had an argument over something silly. i slapped myself and punched myself all over my body.   i m not a beginner when it comes to this. i would also hurt myself whenever my parents would say something bad or hurtful about me. i don t have anyone to go to. the only thing i can do is hurting myself.   i feel bad for him. having to deal with someone like me. i m scared asking my psychiatrist for help. they might think i m overreacting.,2020-05-02 14:35:32

111439,i haven t felt right for awhile now. my symptoms started with feeling anxious and exhausted. i went for a medical checkup and everything came back normal. i was hoping to feel better. i spent months doing thing like changing diet  exercise  spending time in nature  etc. that helped some  but i still struggled with anxiety. then i started to not feel much pleasure in anything. i feel empty a lot and still get waves of anxiety. my sleep is disrupted with weird dreams and waking up several times a night. other night if i m really tired i sleep well. i was always quiet  but now i don t have much interest in being social much anymore. i still work and stay active. i just feel miserable at times. i ve checked with a few mental health professionals and get answers like stress. i m concerned though since this ha been going on for several months now. i ve had stress in the past  but shouldn t now. i m worried about this possibly being depression.,2021-02-20 04:00:28
5231,hello guys  how you all doing   i have some doubts and i would be happy if anyone could give me a light on this problems      in resume   i ve been praticing meditation every day for about one year and a half now   i ve had a lot of insights and even  vision  so to speak about the inner and out aspects of life   things have changed so dramatically in my life because of this new habit  and   today   i can say firmily that i am a better version of my self than i was in past.     problem itself is that meditation sort of stagnated   its not flowing like at the 3    5 mounths since i started .     in better words   usually when i sit down to meditate   theres is this 5   10 minutes to enter the  zone   if the outside does not disturb xd   where things start to happen   emotion   senses and thoughts all start to flow but in a calm way  like a calm river and   in a figurative way  i can sort of see and feel   the water bellow and understand that the world and me is more than the tangible things that are   more than this 3d world.  but now   when i enter this zone   theres nothing  just the black of the closed eyes    i dont feel detached from my body  wich for me was a good thing   like a trip   and even after 40    1h 20 of meditation i dont feel full or completed like before if that make sense.   for aditional info     that lack of feel during meditation started for about 3 mounths ago    i have a good heath with good habities and my body and mind are ok      i fear that is nothing more in meditation.,2021-11-15 10:36:51

20847,i m so mad with my depression  i ve got that sadness where you can t really cry and your throat and head hurt.  i m high functioning so i throw myself into work entirely and every other facet of my life is left to shit.  apparently it s one of my coping mechanisms. i haven t refilled my prescription for two weeks because i have to go monthly and it s really hard for me to just call the doctor and go to the pharmacy. i used to get 6 months worth but this new doctor wants to see me monthly which is a pain. then i end up going off my meds i m so tired and it s just a battle every day.  i was going well with attempting relationships but now i m so dead inside i just can t fathom trying. the thought of intimacy and sex fills me with anxiety and a sickening feeling.  anyway just needed to get it out  sick of burdening my friends with all my problems. i m sure they re sick of me too.,2020-04-10 05:43:58

42031,  tl dr circumstances this past weekend simulated a near death experience for me. in reality  i was in immediate danger but not life threatening and small chance for permanent harm. but in my mind  i believed i was going to die.    i was put on a seemingly benign prescription for blood pressure  about a week and a half ago. last thursday evening  while sitting at my  desk at home  i began to have a strange sensation that quickly turned  into starting to lose consciousness. as i have blood pressure issues  my  first thought was that it was something to do with my heart. though my  vision was narrowing  and my perception of the outside world was quickly  fogging  i had this strange and kind of haunting clarity in my head. i  thought about my family  things that i strive to do that i haven t done   and the speculation of what was perhaps about to happen. what seemed  like an hour of deliberation in my head was only 3 or so minutes. my  logic was clear.  my ideation prior to this was that basically if i  died it would be the end of suffering and a kind of release into  oblivion and non existence. that seemed attractive until it was  in my  mind  faced with the choice of intervening or letting it happen. at this  moment  i chose to intervene. it was not out of fear. i did not see or  hear the presence of the divine. though my life has been filled with  suffering  i decided it was not going to end alone in my house. it was  not going to end with this many things unresolved and unfulfilled. it  would devastate my family and though i wouldn t care in the state of  oblivion  i did not want my potential last moments to be filled with a  selfish and guilt ridden disgust with myself for choosing the path to  what i desired previously.   after this was decided  i dialed 911.  the paramedics quickly came  i was stabilized and taken to the er.  luckily  my own perception of almost dying was all that it was. i had  never experienced anything like this  but medically speaking  i was  having a reaction to the new prescription that threw my blood chemistry   particularly potassium and other electrolytes  out of whack. it was an  immediate danger  don t get me wrong  but if i chose the other path  i  would have passed out for a while and most likely have woken up on the  floor. i m glad i made what i think was the right decision. i don t know  how i could live with myself if i made the other choice and survived  knowing i was truly willing to betray everyone that loves me. it would  have haunted me for the rest of my life.   i was not immediately  taken off the medication  for some reason  so i ended up back in the er  on saturday. same issue  same treatment  released a few hours later. iv  fluids were a welcome gift and the gigantic potassium pills were  appreciated though cumbersome to ingest...  i am now off the  medication. i am sad in a way because prior to this weekend  i was  feeling much less winded on any exertion. the drug is still working its  way out  so i have felt foggy and strange since albeit better each  additional day. i hope to find something that helps me as much without  the reaction i experienced. i look at this as not a trauma  but a rare  opportunity for a depressed person.   i am not miraculously cured  of my depression  but i was able to have the simulation of a near death  experience and a window of time to make a decision. most people that  struggle do not have this opportunity. they are forced to make a  decision in the dark and deep fog of skewed perception i am usually in. i  was provided a strange window of clarity  free from this fog  temporarily. i am lucky to have had this experience and hope if there is  anyone else struggling  they can see what happened with me and perhaps  reconsider harming oneself.  i am the first guy to tell you that in a depressed mind  suicide is attractive. for over a decade i was sure of it. i myself believe that i will be non existent after i die. perhaps this was in my favor in my decision making in my mind. at least for me though  when this damned disease was pushed out of the way for one fleeting frame of my life  i saw clarity. i now subscribe to the fact that your depressed mind is not who you actually are. it is a perverse filter that this illness puts in between perception and your consciousness.   i realize that depression is not the affected person. you and i are not bad people  not low life losers  not guilt ridden people who value themselves less than dirt. that is the disease sitting in between the outside world and our minds.   as an addendum  i don t ever want this to shame anyone who has had these thoughts like me. you are not a bad person for feeling suicidal. i had been for many years. it is part of the illness. i am merely sharing my experience to at least put what i learned for myself out there. this experience was profound to me. i want to say again that i am still depressed. this was not a cure  but a learning experience for me.   as brothers and sisters in the same struggle  please keep going to therapy. if you can  please follow the  homework  and exercises. i benefit from my psychiatrist as well with some medications and tms therapy earlier this year.,2020-06-23 06:59:44

7566,this one took me awhile to learn and it still takes active practice. no one likes being told they re an idiot or made to feel embarrassed. if someone makes an incorrect statement  give them an out and allow them to walk it back. there s no scoreboard in life or a game you can win by always being the one with the right answer.  unless of course you are somehow on a game show than by all means  say that right answer    simply reframing how you word something can do wonders. instead of   that s not how you spell that it s actually blahblah.  try  i think it might be spelled blahblah  no     and some people may never admit their mistake and that s ok too. life will be a million times more peaceful and harmonious if you just shrug your shoulders and move on  instead of dying on every hill. plus what good is being right if you re an asshole in the process ,2021-09-23 07:52:22
182698,hey you. just wanted to put this out there hoping you would find it one day. i messed up  like i always do haha. anyway i gave up on life when we bu. it s not you and don t blame yourself.  i have been going down hill ever since  my body has slowly started shutting down. i have never felt worse the i do today. i m trying to finish this job tonight so she isn t left hanging. so tonight or tomorrow i m going to go to the hospital.  i know they can t do anything for me but i m hoping they can keep me comfortable.  i know i won t be walking out of there so i wanna tell you. i love you more then anything and i m sorry for everything. at least this way i won t be hurting anymore. i miss you very much and love you a lot. you are very special and you have a heart of gold. don t settle for nothing but the best. go for your highest goals you can get it.  take care t.  j.,2021-11-12 15:37:30
117442,i ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for about 10 15 years now. last year it got a lot worse and i finally made the decision to do something about it. in the beginning of february i started taking lexapro. since the first day i started taking it it felt like my partner was sowing seeds of doubt. i ve been trying to rebuff his comments  but it has really started to wear on me.   he s had his own experience with antidepressants and it sorta feels like he s projecting his experiences onto me. not sure if projecting is the correct term. he said it made him feel like a zombie and ruined his libido  his ex girlfriend flushed them down the toilet because of the libido thing.    we recently got into an argument about medication and he called it a crutch  which is a bit hypocritical when he relies on anti anxiety medication. he doesn t like how difficult it is for me to orgasm now  but that s the only sexual side effect i ve had. i still have a higher libido than him. i d gladly trade orgasms for feeling like my heart isn t about to explode all the time and finally being able to take the steps to progress in my life. orgasms aren t even my main objective from sex  i really just enjoy the intimacy with him.    him calling it a crutch is the main thing that s upsetting me now and it has kinda brought me back to a similar headspace that prevented me from seeking help earlier. i keep thinking that other people have it worse  i m just lazy and worthless and that s why i haven t been able to achieve a degree  that i just need to power through all the bullshit  everyone else can why can t i  he apologized and hasn t brought it up since but i still just feel worthless and kinda like i m  cheating  through life.,2021-03-16 05:09:38
104005,i am tired of hearing people talk about  having depression  that lasts one day. i don t want to underestimate their mental state  but it s this kind of people  who make fun of those  who are really depressed.  why are they angry  that i don t feel well  why do you think that  listening to music  will cure a dissease  and how am i  fucked up  just because i can t handle my emotions like non depressed people. why are you making fun of my anxiety. why do you have to make fun of my scars  why are you trying to trigger me    i am really sorry for those  who are bullied  by those who handle their  depression  by listening to music.   now  after writing this  i have feeling that i am throwing shit at the wrong group of people. if you are one of them  please leave those  who are not bothering you alone.  and if you thing you may be depressed  no matter how long your sadness lasts  talk to someone more educated about this subject  thank you for reading  i just wanted to vent this out of my system,2021-01-23 08:23:57

32,so my friend 22m  and i  22f  catch up each week or so to talk about our week. however  i am finding some of his comments self centered. in other words  he sort of suggested that i send him subliminal messages via snapchat. here are some example.  1. on my snapchat story  i posted a garden followed by a pretty sunflower. the next day he posted a sunflower sticker that he has in his car.  i know that people have the right to post anything they want on their stories. however  when i saw this  i felt a little off. it reminded me of the comment he made in which he said that i send him snaps. but in reality  the pictures that he was talking about are pictures that i post on my stories. by the way  i don t send him any snaps at all.  2. i rarely post stories on my ig. but when i do  he would post a story as well.  again  people can post what and when they want but its pretty similar to what i post. it makes it seem like we are a couple tbh  or at least in my point of view.   3. i deactivated my ig because i m studying for the gre. he then told me that he deactivated his ig too.  4. i told him that i made a twitter account because i want to be expose to the  trends news  faster and follow institutions and organizations that i am interested in. the following week  he told me that he made a twitter account for the same reasons that i listed above. then he asked if i had a twitter account  i was a little confused . by the way  i know that he has had a twitter account for at least a year because he showed me a meme on his twitter when we met.  5. he keeps saying that we follow each other on reddit. however  i have already told him no three times.  at this point  i feel like i m just venting.,2021-02-02 17:08:00

122872,i feel like i m losing my mind. like i m going insane. i feel like i dont want to exist  but not that i want to die  just disappear. i cant tell anyone. my internal emotions are everywhere. im fine  then sad  then happy  angry  exhausted  numb. im all the feelings.i hate this. i have an appointment with a psychologist in 2 weeks. i cant tell if my empathy is still intact or if im faking it qnd just think it is real. i know im faking my emotions with everyone else right now. but the irritability definitely is showing through. i feel so lost.,2021-04-16 18:42:49
6860,it can be tempting to join the party bus of social media crazes but don t forget that someone needs your action more than they need your  likes .   prime example    all of these restaurants pouring 13 beers for the 13 service members who gave their life for freedom. while this gesture is nice  if that picture is all you do then you are missing a huge opportunity to make a huge difference in a veteran s life by donating to a veterans assistance organization.   i m not saying  don t have fun . i am saying   pour your beers  dump your ice buckets  post your pics and videos  but then do something .,2021-09-03 09:36:37
11363,if you re unlucky in love with online dating sites  then post a pic of someone better looking. when you re meeting for the first time  stop by their table and ask .... is your name so and so  use any name other than their own. of course they will say no. tell them you were supposed to meet someone for the first time and you got stood up. then tell them how hard it is to meet quality people online. this will most likely begin a conversation. ask if you can join them and offer to buy them a drink. boom    ,2022-01-05 09:01:48
112901,i became friends with  albert  about 2 years ago. we bonded over soccer  dogs  divorce  and our mutual depression. he was a kind soul who cared for others and was great to talk to.  last week he committed suicide. and it s hurting more than i thought it would. we weren t crazy close  but we were friends. and his passing hurts. because part of me thinks  that could have been me.  we were similar.  part of the point of this is  to any of you who are at or beyond your capacity to want to live. you re far from alone. there are people who value you.  if you can  get a pet or a plant to care for. even a goldfish. talk to it about your deepest problems. it helps. especially if you don t feel like you have anyone to talk to.  i ll miss albert. i m mourning. and i m doing what i can so i don t spiral.,2021-02-24 12:00:45
123701,i was okay for a few months  life was actually bearable for a while. i feel like absolute shit now and i don t know why  nothing has changed. nothing feels fun and all i want to do is sleep and eat  but when i eat i feel worse because it reminds me how much i hate my body. my dysphoria has been getting worse too  i know i ll never feel fully at home in my body but right now it feels absolutely disgusting. every time i see a man i want to look like i feel like vomiting. my mental health isn t as bad as it was last year  i haven t hurt myself in a while and i don t think i will  but i m scared of slipping back into it if things continue this way,2021-04-19 12:56:26
1897,i ve meditated on and off but never as a habit. one of the most powerful experiences i ve had had been strong jerks in my body  it moves like a whiplash from the lower back to the head  or sometimes side to side. it almost always follows from being in headspace that i remember nothing from.  1. no matter how i try i can t induce it. i d love to be able to do this at will.  2. i know we re not supposed to read into the experiences when we re meditating  and be silent observers  but of all the experiences i have  this is the one i can t let go off. its a state of momentary super awareness and really want to harness it.  urghhh    thoughts  explanations  ideas  theories ,2021-05-12 16:44:31
17011,i know everybody says this and i m probably no different. but lately  especially because of this coronavirus shit  i have felt so useless. i feel like a shell of a human being. i ve been battling depression on and off since i lost my mom at 14 years old  i m 19 now. ever since that day i have felt like i am carrying a 20 pound backpack with me everywhere i go. i have had two therapists since she passed and neither have helped me. i m looking for a new one now.  lately i feel like a burden to everyone in my life. i feel like i m waking up for no reason. today i woke up so angry that i had even opened my eyes. i just wanted to sleep the rest of the day. i took a math exam today and got a 41  on it  and i tried so hard. i used to be smart  i could do homework in a breeze and go about my life. i started my freshman year of college in august of 2019  and ever since then it s been getting progressively worse.   i moved back in with my dad recently  so i m always in my bedroom. i have no motivation to do any of my school work. i don t care if i fail and i don t have plans to go back to school in august. i have a job that i don t care about  even though i am currently working in an urgent care testing for covid 19 during this pandemic  which is not doing me any favors.   i feel like i m constantly searching and waiting for the day when things  get better  or something  big  will happen and that s when my life will finally start  if that makes sense. i m just getting tired of waking up every day and worrying constantly about what i need to do but never having the motivation to do it  then not being able to sleep until 5 am  go to bed  wake up  and do it all over again. i don t know how much longer i can take it.  i hope all of you are taking care of yourselves.,2020-03-27 05:32:00
1381,some communication apps recognize phone numbers and addresses and make them easy to select within the body of a longer message  but most apps don t.   good   message 1   sure  here s his number  message 2   1234567890  less helpful   message   sure  his number is 1234567890   in the good example  the recipient can more easily select the number by copying the entire message  since there is no other info in that message. if their messaging app isn t savvy about numbers  or only gives the option to directly call that number  rather than copy it  the recipient will waste some time deleting the first part of the message.  it s a small thing  but if doing something similar in bulk  or even just accounting for the net effect over time  it s always best to be efficient and respect everyone s time.  if you re in a time crunch and need to save a number  but the only option in your messaging app is to call that number  just call it quickly and immediately end the call  then copy the phone number from your call history.,2021-04-04 20:23:42
10872,think of it as how much it costs to have that one person stop  asking you for money forever.  i sometimes even initiate this   i can lend you the money if you promise to pay it back. it s for something important .  it s a win win situation if they pay you back or not.,2021-12-25 01:56:43
100896,after reading it after typing this i realize this is more of a rant about my mental health rather than specifically my anger. point still stands tho   every waking moment of my day is spent seething in anger and frustration. i have intrusive thoughts of cutting myself and hurting one of my cats cuz he can be a dick sometimes. on the outside it looks like i m calm and collected but inside it s just a constant 24 7 mental breakdown of rage and sadness. all the time i have to myself is just screaming and crying in my head. i have no outlet. i have nothing to be sad or angry at so i don t know why i m even feeling like this. i ll admit that it s probably the best i ve ever been socially i m still just angry and sad all the time.   it doesn t help that i also have dermatillomania which makes me feel hideous with all the scars i ve made for myself. every time i speak to anyone other than my friends i feel like i m a bumbling quiet idiot who can t form a single sentence.  i want to kill myself but i don t as well. the only thing stopping me is thinking of what will happen after i do it. not just to my friends and family but to my consciousness as well. if it weren t for supportive friends and video games carrying me through these past 3 years i definitely would ve killed myself already,2021-01-14 01:02:50
40183,life is just making goals till the day you die but no goal leads to freedom or happiness.   it just doesnt make sense i dont think waking up and sleeping at a reasonable time is happiness.  people keep saying that smoking and drinking kills me but im gonna die anyway im here for a good time not a shit time.,2020-06-17 03:59:11
151599,i feel like an island. over the past year it seems like i ve drifted away from everyone in my life to the point where it feels like i ve lost the ability to maintain meaningful relationships. i feel extremely isolated from others   like i m trapped in my own mind. people that used to make me really happy i now feel an indifference towards or worse they make me extremely angry. new people that come into my life seem so bland and uninteresting. every interaction i have with another person feels so fake. all my responses in conversation feel rehearsed and not genuine  it s like instead of actually being apart of a conversation  i m an actor that has their lines already memorized  or a robot with a set of pre written responses. at the same time  i ve developed a very short temper when it comes to talking to people. an otherwise benign statement or conversation topic will instantly sour my mood and when people make mistakes i just can t seem to let it go and in my head i actively hold it against them. everyone disappoints me. maybe i should just isolate myself from society for a while and cut out all of my friends and family. if i don t  i worry that i will eventually hate anyone that ever cared for me. what the fuck is wrong with me ,2021-07-25 04:13:38
140890,for a few years now. 18m. i have developed this almost romantic fantasy to kill myself. i genuinely believe it s how i will go  and it s not too far away. had a couple attempts a of so far. i m going to go sober soon  i genuinely think i will. that s not to say how long for tho.  does anybody feel this almost  lust  and rush of feeling when planning fantasizing to kill yourself  ,2021-06-16 19:52:40

3036,i really like her a lot and i don t want her to just be labeled as toxic or something like that i want to repair our relationship  i used to be the shy smart insecure girl  but i recently started opening up to people more. my shyness went away and now i m the  funny  smart  outgoing  pretty and confident girl   she s the one who said it  not me  it makes me kinda sad because she didn t say it as a compliment  more like in a mean way. but honestly  i m still insecure  i just appear confident in front of others. she s the only person whom i can tell this kind of stuff  but lately  i feel like she s really mad at me because  everything is so easy to me   like having good grades  making friends  not giving a fuck about other people s opinions and being just overall mentally strong. she s also smart and pretty  even though she says otherwise. she has really low self esteem because of her social media addiction  and i really wanna help her overcome that. i talked about it with my mom and she said that she might feel inferior to me. how do i make her more comfortable ,2021-06-12 17:53:32
10720,i am someone who is always on the road for work and frequently have to use the bathroom while out and about and can t make it home.   fast food bathrooms are typically kind of gross because the staff don t care and they are highly frequented.   gas station bathrooms are the worst because people are in and out of them all the time and it s really hit or miss how nice the gas station will be.  think about it  grocery stores have very few people who go shopping think to use the grocery store bathroom. they are frequently cleaned and often fully unoccupied. not to mention they are usually well stocked. if you find yourself on the road and need a bathroom in a pinch  the grocery store is the place to go.,2021-12-21 12:16:03

9728,also works with small kids. it s like they know that if they push to the limit of your patience and nothing happens  then further whining barking is a waste of effort. but don t be a jerk  obviously. should go without saying that if your dog wants attention  you should give it if you can. but sometimes you just can t  like if you re driving or in the middle of a very demanding defecatory situation.  actually  this probably only works if you are the kind of person who often needs to be goaded into action. you a  dog parents are probably like  what is op even talking about.   i dunno about cats.,2021-11-24 11:14:53

148045,i ve been struggling with my mental health for a few years  and have made very little headway in finding a way out. i suspect it is more complex than simply depression  however i am continually being let down by the nhs mental healthcare and am prepared to go private.   i ve decided it would be appropriate to acquire a diagnosis so i can try to undergo therapy or medication that may be more suitable to whatever it is i m dealing with. could anyone recommend any good psychiatrists or anyone else who is trained to diagnose mental health conditions in the east midlands area of the uk ,2021-07-12 15:12:05

3340,allow me to elaborate  even if you don t want to mess around with electronics and gadgets too much  this kind of kit can be really useful when you just want to upgrade your laptop or pc  or do some troubleshooting.  moreover  a lot of manufacturers in a wide variety of industries use some relatively obscure bits  which you probably won t have the right tools to open. i ve seen these anti tamper screws in the likes of tv remotes and even knives and scissors    i recommend getting a kit with prying tools and other suck miscellaneous bits and bobs because they can be really useful when you want to open a container or jam something open closed. my recommendations include ifixit s wide range of toolkits  or even something cheaper  like this     generic toolkit  https   www.amazon.com precision screwdriver professional magnetic suitable dp b07q6gf47n ref sr 1 1 sspa dchild 1 amp keywords laptop repair kit amp qid 1622536232 amp sr 8 1 spons amp psc 1 amp spla zw5jcnlwdgvkuxvhbglmawvypuexrjrdmk1owtjmr0rfjmvuy3j5chrlzelkpuewntyyndyzv1rqvza1mkxtt0q5jmvuy3j5chrlzefkswq9qta1njkynjexrlbeuvhzwevavuxpjndpzgdlde5hbwu9c3bfyxrmjmfjdglvbj1jbglja1jlzglyzwn0jmrvtm90tg9nq2xpy2s9dhj1zq      ifixit  https   www.ifixit.com ,2021-06-01 04:39:03
9694,if you have to leave a voicemail  ick  for someone who may not have your number and will likely need it  leave your callback number twice. this is for many reasons  the first one may be garbled  they may not want to relisten to the whole message to hear your number  it s kind.  formula   greeting  this is  your name  at  company . my number is  callback number .   message .  again  this is  your name  at  company  my number is  callback number .  closing .  i once got a job offer and the district manager rattled off his phone number so fast  i couldn t understand the last 2 numbers. when i called back to the store where i was interviewed  they wouldn t take a message even. he never called me back and i lost the job. i dodged a bullet  but they missed out on me.   don t miss out on awesomeness.,2021-11-23 10:54:38

7179,especially if that person was previously nice to you or you have no reason to believe that they would say something unkind about you. a lot of manipulators will use the fact that some people believe things at face value to control what people think about each other and cause conflict or separation. if you recognize this behavior  it will save you a lot of grief and tension and stress. if you are able  hear the other person s side of things as well.,2021-09-11 22:30:38

60676,i thought i was doing better and worked with my doctor to go off of anti depressants. but things didn t work out and went back on. rather than start at 5mg  i am back right on 10mg right away.   i ve felt like i have a lot more energy now that i m back on lexapro. in a way it s good since i don t dread waking up in the morning. but i m scared i might be too hyped up now  feeling a bit too alert and restless.   i also am having some sexual side effects. i get the urge but performance seems to be an issue. it s only my right hand so i m not embarrassing myself with a person but does anyone have libido changes due to lexapro ,2020-08-31 00:08:05

6951,i don t know if this is the best thread for this but i hyper analyze meaningless things. like my backpack and phone case have to match or it will bother me a crazy amount. my phone wallpaper has to be black and white because i hate the way the color  clashes  with the black case and black phone. i really only wear black  white  grey and occasionally red and blue. but i really don t deviate from mainly black and white. i know a lot of people have preferences in colors of things but i can t stand when colors are mixed or different brands are mixed  for example  having a otterbox iphone case and a tech21 ipad case. that would bother me so much. they both have to be the same brand and color or color else it bothers me a crazy amount . i think i definitely have anxiety but i think also being depressed makes me hyper analyze things because my brain is so starved of stimulation. i don t know really  but does anyone understand do this themselves ,2020-02-22 09:38:18

9878,this type of music is specifically created to enhance concentration and focus. also  as it  mostly  has no lyrics  it won t really divide your attention  just as it doesn t take you out of a film  it helps with immersion. lastly  it tends to be quite  epic  or motivational music  which is a nice extra.  my personal favorite is just shuffling hans zimmer s music  the new dune album kicks ass  it might be one of my favorites for studying.   anyway  off i go to keep on cramming for my finals  hope this helps someone ,2021-11-28 16:58:48

7701,a human being s purpose could be to be survive the next day in a trench with your army buddy  save the animals in your state or get your political party elected. the sort of  go to  purpose that requires little work cognitively recognized and supported  by law  in society is take care of your children. it s a story you tell yourself and will bring you out of dark places once you find your purpose.. and again. this could be anything  it could be to be the best damn knitter in town or best jiu jitsu fighter in your gym .  albert einstein said   greater the ego  lesser the knowledge. lesser the ego  greater the knowledge   but i have learned from artificial intelligence researcher joscha bach that the ego is instrumental to your person once you have meaning  sacred purpose  in your life. once you find meaning  then create the elaborate story of yourself that high ego individuals possess. why  because it is a powerful tool to achieve your goals.  a person who doesn t have a purpose in life is most likely feral  his her incentives are not in line with their neighors   very interesting point of view and subjectively i strongly believe that you  the reader  if you are in a place in life where you feel a bit lost  finding something to fight for should bring you out of it  it has or me   this is the video where he said it. i spooled it to the correct part though it is 2.3 hours it only a few minutes in to where its queued.  https   www.youtube.com watch v brd37hmyr8i amp t 2531s,2021-09-26 14:37:22

556,we had a really bad infestation of mice about a month ago. i d go to the bathroom  and there would be several in the bathroom closest. always peaking out under the door when i d enter. they were in the bedrooms  i could hear them scurrying about in the ceiling. even had one bold enough to be ripping up the carpet right behind my computer desk  while i was sitting at it.  i tried mouse traps  glue traps  nothing worked. i didn t want to put poison out  because i didn t want to have to deal with the stench of dead  rotting mice trapped in the walls and ceiling. finally  i stumbled across some recommendations to use peppermint oil. although there were quite a few people stating that it didn t work. i went to the store and...they were out of peppermint oil. so i went to the baking aisle and saw they had peppermint extract. desperate  i bought several bottles  figuring it was better than nothing. i also bought a 100 pack of the plastic cups used for rinsing after you brush.  i poured some oil in the cup  dabbed a cotton ball in  and placed it where i had seen mice and their droppings. i repeated this process  until i had used about 30 cotton balls. within a few days  i noticed that i wasn t seeing mice or droppings. within a week  i wasn t hearing any scurrying in the ceiling. this past week  when temps dropped to 7 degrees  was a true testament to how well this worked. it was freezing outside for a solid week  and still not a single mouse to be heard or seen. i honestly believe that peppermint extract works far better than peppermint oil. and it s cheaper than peppermint oil.   summary      1. buy peppermint extract  located in the baking aisle of the store       2. buy bag of cotton balls  located in the cosmetics section of the store       3. buy rinse cups   located in either the area where disposable dishes are  or where the toothpaste is .       4. pour a little amount of oil in the cup  just enough to cover the bottom  and dip the cotton ball in the cup  rolling it around  until the oil is gone. place cotton ball in area of infestation.      5. repeat as necessary.    a little of this extract goes a long way.   edit  it s the scent of the extract that repels the mice.,2021-02-23 18:41:45

71807,i ve been struggling with depression for years but only really recently started trying to actually do something about it and not make it a crutch to not deal with life. i ve been on a good regime of anti depressants and they ve really helped my day to day well being. but recently i find myself thinking more long term and finding that i don t see the point in going on any further. i ve done most things in life i want and i honestly don t if i can bear the fact that the rest of my life for the next 40 years is just working at my job. maybe having a relationship here and there. but honestly what is the point of going on if this it  i wouldn t say i m suicidal but i definitely think about it as more of a  what if  but i wouldn t act on it. this has been my biggest struggle so far in the last few months and i feel like it was always a major underlying factor in my mental health. i don t know what to do to get out of this mindset or if i should talk to someone because i don t know how they would change my mind.   honestly it just feels good to type this out even if no one does read it.,2020-10-13 01:25:11
125678,i ve dealt with depression for just about my whole life  but i m going numb. i was really hoping it wouldn t get to this point  but it just has. i got help as a sort of new years resolution this year  to get better  so i finally did  except that made it worse. not because the help itself is bad  but i feel guilty about asking for help because i m not old enough to live out on my own  nor do i have a job in this climate  so i live with my mother and stepfather a majority of the time. their marriage is already crumbling and they don t have their jobs  so me asking them to pay money for me to talk to somebody about my thoughts every week  therapist  feels awfully selfish  on top of medication. so i ve been pretending that i m becoming normal again so they wont have to keep paying for at least my therapy meetings  but really i m actually the worst i ve ever been. i haven t ever had a girlfriend  and the loneliness gets to me more than anything else. all my friends and cousins and siblings are all getting lovers while i m stuck here. i just want to know what real love feels like  but i don t think i deserve it. i ve done things in the past i m not really proud of  so who am i to demand love from someone. if there is a god  which i don t think there is   then this must be his way of punishing me for those past wrongdoings  internal torture. fair enough  well played. then on top of everything else going on  my stepfather insults me almost every day. this has been going on since 3rd grade when my mom met him  and i thought this would stop once i asked for help  but now they just feel more mean spirited than they did before. during january  i attempted to use his insults as a platform in which i could change into a better person  but its hard to change into a good person when that voice in the back of your head tells you to give up everyday  so i eventually did give up and now i m on the edge. i know its clich   but honestly i cant think of a better way to phrase tit. i m hanging on the the edge of a cliff  and i feel like just letting go. nothing brings me much joy anymore  getting up in the morning feels like a chore  what do i have to pull myself up for  nothing.,2021-04-25 21:25:36
63104,i m my biggest problem  no one cares  i want to do better but everything i try ultimately makes me feel worse  i feel so isolated and alone. i don t have any friends or anyone yo talk to. everyone i know isn t really interested in knowing anything about me. no one really ever has been.   but oh well i guess nothing is all that different than the last few years so i ll just keep muddling through in my own misery.   ,2020-09-09 03:07:12
1901,so this has been going on for months now. but basically my  best friend  for four years started to befriend another girl. at first it was kinda normal but i felt insecure because i didn t have that many friends besides her back then. then she started to stop trying to meet me  i had to be the one initiating all the time  wouldn t tell me stuff but her and they both would exclude me from conversations. should i try to rescue the friendship or take some distance ,2021-05-03 05:51:34
31051,not a whole lot to say. i m a shitty worker and just kind of jump around jobs. i keep thinking  this is gonna be the one. this is the job  but i just get bored and miserable. i ve tried college a couple times but i can t write an essay to save my life.  just sort of feeling like i m on this treadmill with no progress. i might be facing criminal charges in the future  along with maybe being homeless. and like  if that s the case  what s the point  you know   i ve been learning japanese for a while  thought maybe it d be a valuable skill. i like translating  but i don t know how i ll ever make any money at it without a degree. it s fun  but i doubt i can turn it into a career.  so i m just sort of... left waiting. waiting for the situation to grow so bad that i jump from the burning building that is my life.  it feels like being stuck in a lobby  waiting for your turn.,2020-05-16 05:39:49
184105,i can t be happy. i ve tried therapy  medication won t work for me  and i would rather die than be admitted to a mental hospital.  i met a girl who makes me happy but she doesn t love me back. i told her i m fine with being just friends but i feel like i m lying to her when we re together and i have to hide how much i love her. i ve tried to leave space between us but i don t have many other ways to be happy so i always end up coming back.  none of my projects are working out how i want them too. i can t be satisfied with any of the music i make. i can t get in the right headspace to write for my stand up sets or my book. i don t have the motivation to do anything for school and i might have to drop out and miss out on my degree.  the only thing i can do is smoke and drink  and distract myself online so that i don t have to be alone with my thoughts  and if i am  i m usually too drugged and out of it to comprehend them.   it s been like this for months  it s honestly a miracle i haven t killed myself yet. i m trying to stick with it for my family s sake  but my hatred for myself is beginning to overwhelm my love for them.   i ve started to do things like talk to myself at loud in public  i ve been cutting myself  and i feel like i can t interact with people anymore. it s agony.,2021-11-17 03:55:40
2249,i  23 f  have been friends with this person  also 23 f  since college. i have been by her side whenever she needed me  and whenever she needed to hug someone and feel better. i am an introvert with social anxiety so making a lot of friends irl is not really my thing.  the issue is that i feel like she takes me for granted. she always treats new people in her life with much more love than she has ever treated me. she never wants to take any photos with me  it s as if she knows i ll always be there and she won t need the memories. she s very kind to me and has been there for me as well  but always cancels on me when someone else wants to see her. she sends our other friends gifts out of nowhere and truth be told  i got jealous today when i found out she did it again. it makes me question why she never does the same stuff for me. i am always available for her but she has put me quite low on her list.   to be fair  she has never asked me what i expect from our friendship but she never asks other people either. she just does stuff for them she never does for me. i feel quite childish even writing this  but it has been bothering me for a while now and i needed to get it out. am i expecting too much  am i not doing enough  what can i do to stop feeling this way about my friend ,2021-05-15 08:27:06
87744,if you re reading this  you are most likely like me. going through it  questioning yourself  unable to muster any sort of energy and being so uncertain of what is to become. i think it s safe to say that after this year  we really are on the edge of our seats. with everything happening in the world  we also realize how quickly things went downhill.   just as bad things can happen so quickly  so can good. not just talking about covid  but in general. and if you have been going through it for some time  that still applies. in a couple of months you could be in a completely different place. whether it s a relationship  new job  new place to live or mental headspace. maybe i m hopeful but it s true.  i have to remind myself that even on the hardest of days. i m currently working on changing my perception because the happiest people i know say it starts with that. looking at what life has given  rather than not or what it s taken away.   i know we all are in different situations and some may look at this and doubt. i get it. but i needed to hear this for myself and knew someone would too.,2020-12-07 11:12:43
6678,or  ideally  we put in the effort  push past the awkward get to know you phase and end up having some meaningful conversations about our passions  hopes  dreams  successes  failures  traumas  trust issues and miscellaneous demons. hell  maybe even come to realize we have similar personalities and senses of humor  and we form a bond. that might be cool too.  start with something fun about yourself and let s see where it take us,2021-10-01 08:12:56
5696,i have been doing this for a while and it s going well  however when i sit down  my heart beat seems louder and faster  and after a while my body aches all over. this is from sitting cross legged and sat straight or leaning on my backrest in my chair. it s hard to ignore but i can t find another position as lots i ve tried make me sleep. has anyone had the same problem  if so what do you reccomend ,2021-12-16 19:24:23
186849,tw  mention of   sh    depression  adhd  death     i have been going through a phase of depression right now that is pretty bad. it comes every year around this time of year due to the anniversary of my father s death 4 years ago   my father s birthday  a bad childhood memory almost 10 years ago       tw     the anniversary of me quitting     sh     5 years   and a few other things. the holidays are tough without my dad and my family structure has been messed up since he died so that is tough too. all of these feelings cause immense sadness  which lead to great frustration which i find very triggering.   this episode of depression started last saturday. saturday and sunday i had a lot of time just crying and fighting triggers and basically just     tw     wanting to die a little. not enough to act on anything  but enough that i was basically incapacitated. i was feeling depressed already before saturday and sunday but it reached its peak those days  which is followed by what i call  the depths . because the depression was coming for a week or two i had begun to retract from everything  so my house is a mess  my workflow is disrupted  tasks have piled up  which is increasing feelings of hopelessness.      my husband recently lost his job so he s been home a lot  which i thought would be a good thing as i m going through this. but basically i m finding that every time i m like this it stresses him out  he gets agitated  he tries to give constructive criticism  etc. which none of that is helpful to me at all and we ve talked about it basically every time im like this. in addition to that  he is stressed out while looking for work and he s not good on the computer so i ve had to help him with applications  pick up some slack on bills  and basically its putting stress on both of us which isn t great for either of us.      it s hard cause i want him to speak his mind  but at the same time i don t want it to add to my plate when i m already swimming in things to worry about. this morning he was going hunting and after he got up i couldn t fall asleep again so i got up too and made some coffee. i spent a little time meditating before i came out of the bedroom  trying to psych myself up for the day  which was actually kind of working. i felt more  normal  than i had all week. i came out and he hadn t left yet and we were talking while i got some things ready to go for the day  coffee  cleared a space on the messy table to do some art  checked my list of hand made xmas presents i planned to work on  cleaned out the sink to do dishes later  got some etsy orders ready to package  etc.    amp  x200b   as i cleared a space to do art he mentioned my two big canvases for a  commissioned  art piece that are sitting in the corner  basically saying it was frustrating for him that they were sitting there and that it was bothering him that i was doing other art and other projects making xmas presents  when those canvases still had to be done. the canvases are for a local museum  two of which are done already and on display. the problem was that i did not receive payment after i delivered the first two and so i said they at least had to pay my supplies and sign a contract that i would deliver the other two paintings by x date for x payment at the time of delivery. they agreed to that over email and i had a good conversation with the director  but they re waiting for some grant money to come through so i halted the project until after the new year  but decided to leave the two pieces i d finished up on display.    amp  x200b   after my husband mentioned the canvases he mentioned my tendencies to start projects and never finish them  he mentioned some boxes of stuff in our basement i ve been meaning to go through for months  as well as a few other things i ve been slacking on. my whole mood went from somewhat motivated and ready for my day to back into survival mode pretty much instantly. i was too mentally exhausted to explain or make excuses for any of it and felt too guilty for making him stressed with my behaviors to really defend my behaviors or coping mechanisms. right now all i really have that is bringing me any joy or motivation is working on this new art project  running my etsy and making handmade xmas presents. everything else in life feels like a chore and is so difficult to do.    amp  x200b   my husband has bipolar disorder which tends to be rapid cycling which he isn t managing well right now  so i know he gets depression  and understands it somewhat because i have witnessed him go through plenty depressive cycles. i have adhd and depression and my depression is mostly well managed because i go to therapy and am medicated for adhd. i have been medicated for depression too in the past  but actually am more consistent off the depression meds than when i m on them and medicating my adhd takes away a lot of the depression to the point that i only go through very bad depression once or twice a year usually for 1 3 week and then i m better and i can live life again. i don t think he really understands how much different my depression is from his depression and that he can really prolong my periods of depression by the things that he says or does.    i don t think he meant to be hurtful with his comments this morning. when he saw me shut down he was immediately apologetic and remorseful and hugged me. he was upset with himself and kept saying that  he knows i m doing the best that i can and he shouldn t have said anything   which somehow made me feel worse. i want him to be able to communicate with me regardless of my mental state  i also want to be able to do things right now  but honestly i just can t handle much. he prompted me to talk about some of the things i wanted to do today and asked questions about my new art project to try to get me back on track  which was really sweet  and should have been helpful to regain my composure and motivation.    amp  x200b   but yeah  honestly its been like an hour now and i ve just been sitting on the couch since he left.     tw     i ve had some sh urges this week  and then again this morning  but am feeling better on that front  it was just some fleeting thoughts. trying to get motivated for the things i planned to do today  but am feeling more and more like skipping the coffee  not taking my adhd meds  and going back to sleep.,2021-11-27 08:29:36
8172,alright  i ve been mostly wanting just chats these past few days but i kinda want something more now. basically just want a friend i can talk to on a regular basis but it doesn t have to be all day every day. also kinda like snapchat so maybe we can move to that after a while  anyhow  i m 15m as i stated in the title and i m looking for people mostly around my age so 13 17 or maybe a little older if you re a cool person. my only requirement is to not be immature. i like chess  cooking but don t ask for recipes   reading manhua manhwa  started getting back into programming  and of course i love the gym. hopefully i don t sound too boring so hmu,2021-11-07 18:54:44

11592,the overwhelming majority of car accidents occur not from speeding  running red lights  or anything else illegal  it s from simply changing lanes.  always do your best to reduce the number of lane changes you have to do on your route and when you do change lanes  never do so when there s another car parallel to you in another lane over  especially not big rigs  . chances are  if they begin to change lanes at the same time as you  neither of you will notice. you can t see each other s blinkers and each of you will already feel like you re getting closer due to your own movement. always assume someone driving parallel to you will change lanes into you and before switching lanes  simply speed up or slow down so you have a good distance between you when you switch lanes.  this advice is primarily for freeway driving  but also applies for basically everywhere.  i live in the bay area  which has some of the most accidents in america and this single rule has kept me from ever having an accident and i ve seen countless other drivers fail to follow it and get on accidents or come really really close.   people who dart in and out of lanes are the single most dangerous thing on the freeway and avoid them at all costs...well except maybe for driving next to big rigs since their tires blow out fairly often and can completely take you out...thats an extra freebie btw ,2022-01-10 22:36:28

33726,i find myself wanting to do nothing but rot in a hole alone  the people in my life are more toxic did i d like to admit mainly because i m afraid of losing anybody in my life simply because no one has ever stayed is it me what am i doing wrong my father didn t stay i ve never had a girlfriend for longer than a year all i do is work and hate myself and even on days that i love myself which is very rare i still have the thought of the back of my head that tells me i m nothing and i m starting to believe that it s true,2020-05-25 03:47:35
45666,this is my first time ever posting  sorry for any spelling grammar errors. recently my anxiety has gotten unbearable and i just need somewhere to vent  get advice i guess. i ve dealt with depression for most of my teenage years. i recently moved out of my childhood home on bad terms with my mom. my mom just doesn t have the empathy switch  shes never just been able to sit down and give me a hug or tell me she loves me. when i was around 12 13  she discovered i was self harming and she grounded me for doing so. i also lost a close friend to suicide a few years ago  and i tried to help myself by doing what teenagers do and going out to parties and getting in trouble. i know i shouldn t expect her to be a mind reader  but sometimes i wonder how differently i would ve have dealt with his death if she would ve realized my behaviors were a cry for help  not me trying to disobey her. i love my mom no matter what but i can t help but wonder if some of my issues stem from her. i refuse to talk about my feelings now because i m so used to her getting angry at me for being upset and i feel like i don t know how to properly express the way i feel. i thought moving out would fix all my problems  it definitely helped but the last week or so i ve been extremely worried about money bills and i feel like i ve relapsed. i feel so discontent with everything around me no matter what i m doing  i have no motivation to see my family or friends  the only time i really go into public is to go to work or the store if i absolutely have to and the thought of going out into just fills me with dread and i feel like sobbing. i haven t self harmed in years but the thoughts have recently been popping back into my head  i m able to tell myself it s not a healthy coping mechanism but sometimes i can t shut the thoughts off. with all that said  any methods anyone uses to help deal with anxiety or urges of self harm would be much appreciated. sorry for the long read  i appreciate it if you re still here.   ,2020-07-06 00:01:23
5676,when you cut up onions breath through your mouth and not through your nose. can t remember the scientific reason but it is something to do with the ducts up the nasal cavity that drain fluid from the eyes and when you only breath through the mouth this stops the eyes from watering.  hopefully someone will come along who can explain this more eloquently.,2021-08-01 14:54:07

197629,hello reddit. i am a trans teen. i identify myself as non binary and i have been severely depressed for several years. it got to the point where i had to visit the emergency room for self harm and was on suicide watch for a while. i want to come out to my mom and go on hormones but i also feel like it would be useless because i plan on killing myself this year august.   it s been something that was planned since 2 years ago and it s finally approaching. i don t want to have any regrets before i go and i want to be happy while i can. i was also thinking of telling my mom that i was going to kill myself.   she cares for me a lot but she wouldn t understand. she still doesn t. i have been in therapy for 1 year and have been taking antidepressants for around 6 months. when we were going over the half year review she didn t think that i was ever going to kill myself.   due to cultural reasons  my family is korean  she wouldn t understand what being non binary is. my family is also protestant christian and my dad is a pastor. he once told me that gay pastors would burn in the deepest part of hell. my mom compared my community  the lgbtq  to pedos and people who fuck animals.  even if i live  what is the point  trans people will never be accepted. hell even in the trans community i m not accepted sometimes because i m non binary. i was a mistake.   i don t know if i want to die. i know sometimes i do but there is a part of me that enjoys what living brings. i just don t know if those things are enough to live for. i m only 17 but i m so tired. it shouldn t be this hard to live.  i hate it. i hate feeling this way because there are so many people who have it a lot worse than me. it makes me feel disgusting that i want to die even though am privileged to have my own room  a job  enough money to keep my hobby.  i don t know what to do. i want to tell my mom but i feel like it would useless. i don t even know if she ll let me go on hormones. i was also planning on telling her that i would kill myself this year but that seems cruel. i just want her to understand. if anyone can give me advice it would be very helpful. thank you.,2022-01-08 03:26:13

31224,smoking weed once ruined my mental health.  intro    i am currently 20 years old  and six years ago i smoked a lot of weed and completely freaked out. ever since that night  my life has completely changed.    before i continue i am not trolling  please don t try and defend marijuana. i am actually all for weed being legal. i wish it was as accepted 6 years ago so i could have been informed more on how to safely consume it.                          anyway here s me story.   background    growing up my dad  sister and all my cousins smoked weed and i was introduced to it by them. after hearing all these cool things about it i decided to save up some money to buy some myself.   the night my life changed   fast forward six months i finally got enough money for an eighth. i had paid my sister some money to get it off one of her friend s. she gave me the bag and we smoked that night. i didn t feel any effects.   the next night i wasn t planning on smoking but it seemed like a perfect night. my mom was gone  my dad was working the next morning so he was in bed early and my little brothers we upstairs sleeping. i texted my sister  she told me where the stash was  told me to be careful and hung up. i got the weed  packed a really big bowl  about a gram   and smoked it all by myself.   the effects hit.   i immediately felt the urge to run to my bed after 5 minutes of smoking it. i couldn t move at all  my mouth was dried out completely  my ears were ringing super loud  my heart was beating out of my chest and my head absolutely killed. at 14 years old i was truly convinced that was gonna be the last night of my life. memories of my childhood ran thru my head  then like a movie  was my family crying at the scene of me dying and my funeral.  i always have known you cant die from weed  but i was convinced it was over for me. i was having a full blown panic  anxiety attack.  all these weird things kept happening  and after about 20 30 minutes things stated to get better but my head really  really hurt.  i was still nervous because my heart was beating fast and my mouth was dried out.  i fell asleep that night.  the next morning   i woke up the next day for school.  i immediately looked for my phone and took a picture of myself. one of my eyes looked lazy but i was happy to be alive. i immediately got up and got dressed for school. i felt good. i told my mom i loved her and went to the bus.   thought the day of school thoughts kept re o occurring about the night before. it was all weird to me. i felt kind of dazed but i just figured it was because of my experience the night before. i talked to my friend s about and they laughed. u realized life was not meant to be taking for granted and i wanted to live each day like my last. i texted my sister about how crazy the night was and how i m never smoking again in my life.   everything changed again around 5 o clock while eating dessert with my brother and sister. i felt that same anxiety and panic as the night i smoked weed.  i started to freak out  but i tried my best not to show it. i looked over to my sister and she looked extremely disturbed. she had a shocked face and looked at me and said are you ok in a really concerned voice. i said yes.   it s hard to write my life out from now to six years ago  but i went through a lot of panic attacks  anxiety  and regret everyday. i spent all my free time researching the way i feel.  my life since this day has felt like a dream. this doesn t feel like reality. i m writing this now because i feel it getting worse. i just hit the six year mark and april may is the time i think about it. i ve completely changed from that. i have never told my parents  and sometimes i wonder if they notice. they know i don t smoke weed but they think that s because i m a  good kid . i believe i have depersonalization and derealization. i pray it goes away sometime soon. this has caused me to look back at all my childhood memories and pray to get those times back. my personality i feel like has changed. maybe it s not all the bad experience i had   more of just growing up and puberty and all that but i don t know.   due to this experience here are a list of things i struggle with.  self diagnosed depersonalization and derealization  my symptoms are 100  accurate    anxiety  and not depression i don t think but a lot more sadness. dwelling on the past.  i ve never drank alcohol because of this. i have smoked weed again after this and had a good time  still had anxiety  only took one hit  but it hasn t fixed anything. i will not be smoking again.   i m afraid to feel anything other than sober. if i feel slightly different   like a head rush or something i go into full blown panic mode.   social anxiety. i think because months after the experience i spent a lot of time to myself and kind of forgot how to socialize.  now  i have never received treatment for any of this and for the last month i m thinking about opening up to my mom about this. i don t want her to think i m insane  but i just want to see a therapist or someone who can diagnose me for real and see if there s any treatment options. i feel as if i could have ptsd depersonalization and derealization  and at least extreme anxiety. if i had one wish it would just to feel like my 13 year old self again without a worry in the world. i fantasize about waking up the morning after and feeling  all there .   if anyone has something to motivate me to get help  or have gone through something similar please share this with me. if you are young please if you are gonna smoke and experiment start with a little and work your way up. that s my life advice right there.  thank you.,2020-05-16 21:57:50
69025,i realised that i  in a way  want to be depressed. no  i don t want to waste my days  to be lonely  to miss out on so much in life  not to mention torture myself over the things i ve done or said and the things i didn t. the pain is sometimes unbearable.  but whenever i have a chance to change my situation even just a bit  at least go in the right direction  suddenly it all becomes... unimportant  i m yearning for many things and when i know that i can get closer to them they lose their value. i know there s a lot i can do to help myself  but when i try i lose track of why i m doing anything in the first place. i don t know why  i can come up with a number of ashoc explanations but it s not like it matters. my motivation has a fatal short circuit and now i can only imagine that i have a some sort of will to do things when in reality  well  i just want to sleep.,2020-10-02 19:06:34
825,throwaway because i don t want irl friends to see this.  so me and my group of 4 friends have been friends for about 4 years now. we ll call the two friends in this story lisa and jennifer. lisa and jennifer are similar in a lot of ways  but incredibly different in others  so they tend to clash frequently. they have a long history of being friends off and on. we re all the same age  21 22  and have known each other since elementary school. lisa joined the friend group about 2 years ago  so in our eyes we still consider her the newcomer.   me and jennifer had a dispute with lisa earlier in 2020  where lisa was being overly bossy  controlling  and rude. i moved past it fairly quickly  but jennifer held a grudge and they didn t talk for a month or so. eventually jennifer decided to forgive her  despite there being no apology  and things went back to normal.  flash forward to the end of 2020. lisa s birthday was coming up and we were all planning to go out for dinner and pay for lisa s meal  but jennifer couldn t afford to pay for both her meal and lisa s. there were other complications too because lisa was insisting on us getting together on her actual birthdate  despite almost all of us having schedule conflicts. we tried to talk to lisa about doing a different date and working something out  but she blew up at us as she always does. jennifer tried to talk to lisa on the side about it  but lisa went off on jennifer. she essentially called jennifer selfish for not having money set aside for friend s birthday s  shaming her for being poor  and whole lot of other ridiculous stuff. needless to say  it has severed the group. while me and the 2 other friends can obviously see how lisa is in the wrong  this is typical behavior for her  and her and jennifer have always had personal beef  so we don t get involved.   3 months later and we have 2 separate group chats now  one with lisa  and one with jennifer. lisa is over the whole situation now and has moved on. she is blindly unaware and unable to recognize how her words   actions effect other people. there have been no resolutions or apologies. they had another spat today about concert tickets for a show they were planning to go to together. jennifer is now saying that she is officially done with lisa and anyone that affiliates themselves with her i.e. me and my other 2 friends. me and my other 2 friends are tired of constantly being put in the middle between them and its hard to support both friends. lisa is deeply rooted in our lives  she is my coworker   so it would be hard for us to cut her off. what should we do  what should we say to them ,2021-03-13 17:04:23
433,a lot of hard to identify emotional pain is coming up in my meditations over the last few days. any suggestions on what to do to identify what is causing this or do i simply just sit and observe it ,2021-02-21 10:21:30
11338,just someone to check in with daily or every few days to see how we re both doing  talking to one another about what s getting us down  supporting one another to get us through our dark times. having someone there to rely on if things get really rough. that sort of stuff  y know what i mean     swing me a pm if you re interested   ,2022-01-31 04:27:09
41640,no one really prepared me for how much of my time i would spend feeling completely empty and absolutely exhausted even if i ve done nothing all day. and with that emptiness comes a surprising amount of crying for inexplicable reasons. if i knew why i could make myself stop crying instead of falling asleep after my body gets too tired to carry on crying. i can t make myself care about important things but i still cry all the fucking time,2020-06-22 00:12:51
117551,i ask myself  why  when i want to do something  and i can t come up with an answer.  and a few times  i have come up with something resembling an answer  i couldn t pry myself up to do it.  i do all the things.   water  diet  exercise   i can pry myself up to exercise... once a day.  it s like pulling teeth  though.   low stress for having gad   proper sleep  relaxation  avoiding naps  some caffeine  but no binging  no drugs alcohol except the caffeine   and most importantly   meds and therapy  what am i missing ,2021-03-16 14:09:11
1372,for some background  i did my high school in india and moved to america for my undergrad  which i am finishing up this year. back in india  my friends were empathetic and we genuinely cared for and helped each other in times of need. they are still my closest friends to date.  however  in my past 4 years in america  all my friendships made here have been very superficial  which i only realized several months ago. people i believe i had a genuine connection with for years  have really just been self centered and honestly using me just for their personal gains.  i have been through several tough situations in the past year  and my family all live abroad  so i have no support system here besides my  friends . not one of them lent a helping hand and some would be reluctant to do so even when i asked them.  personally  having lived in several countries  i have noticed that americans are generally a little more self centered by culture  but i do believe there are great friends out there for me to make. i have just not found them yet.  i really just needed to get this off my chest. if anyone has advice on how i can make good friends here on out  i would appreciate it. sorry for the long post.,2021-04-16 10:13:06
127657,all i want to do is sleep. i want to escape to another reality where i m happy. i don t want to go to school or work or get a job or do anything. i want to have fun. i want to go to the beach and paint and look at the stars and eat fresh fruit in a garden and travel the world and just be at peace. i don t want to exist in this reality anymore,2021-05-02 11:16:41
175542,here i am at 24  having gone through 3 years of depression. at first i didn t even realize it. i have only started accepting it 1 5 years ago. never before in my life have i been depressed like this. i never had problems getting a grip on life. mental issues  yes. depression  not in the slightest. having mental issues is bad because you equally don t get the things you want in life either. but at least you don t go through the day completely disabled.,2021-10-19 10:26:59

110161,i m sure you ve seen this question a lot or may lack the professional skills to  diagnose  but i m gonna give my story anyway. i m a 20 year old male in college now. as a kid  i had severe add adhd and was constantly being pulled out of class for speech occupational therapy. i had trouble making friends  being socially awkward  still am today . i was bullied sometimes too. when i was 14 i started smoking weed and i am now a chronic user. until recently  i ve never given the idea of being depressed much thought  i ve always thought that i m simply incapable of developing something like it and even used to think  it s just something white girls throw around for attention . anyway i ve always had a feeling of numbness  like i m not even here. sometimes it just feels like i m sitting in my brain on auto pilot just getting through the day. a big indicator is also my lack of self confidence. i hate how awkward i am  how i look  how i act  how i can t build relationships without drugs being involved  everything about me. i have two brothers that accomplish a lot more than me and i feel like a bum. i play a college sport as well and i ve missed been late to so many practices that the next one i lose my scholarship and get kicked off the team. i ve lost all of my drive to succeed in school and basketball. lastly  i ve had suicidal thoughts that have started to be more frequent that past few months.  sorry all of that was a mess. however  it feels better getting it off my chest bc i ve never opened up to anyone about this. so thanks for listening to my rant. i took some acid  lsd  back in october  and came to many self realizations and this has been on my mind ever since. another thing i d like to note is that i m not your stereotypical depressed guy. here s where i get to toot my own horn  i m a 6 7  college athlete  i got a good sense of humor and some girls tend to think i m a cutie   . the only reason i say that is i m the last person that people tend to think would have these problems  however i m usually putting on an act around these people.  after writing all of this  i ve definitely realized that i am not the most stable  but would still like any feedback. this is my first attempt to reach out for help  so any advice or elaborating on similar situations you guys are having would really be appreciated. thanks   ,2021-02-15 15:54:48
3618,i know this probably isn t the right subreddit but y all seem smart and i have no clue where else to post this. my friends mom passed away and she s only 17 im only 17 i have no clue how approach this because i don t even know what to say when somethings even slightly an inconvenience. i don t want to come off insensitive to y all but i genuinely have no clue what to say. and she doesn t even have the closure of knowing what happened to her mom there s currently an investigation. please help if you can.,2021-06-07 21:24:35
123953,i m not ignoring you i m just disconnected right now days  weeks and months are blurred together it s ok  i m managing  somehow  apathy is my mental state it s not as cool as it sounds i struggle to find happiness in anything around  keeping a connection can be really tough it s not just mentally draining it makes me feel rough  two good days  turn into three bad it s been nearly two weeks since i spoke to my own dad  it s like a rollercoaster ride with its up and its downs  but add in a slippery spiral which you are forced to go down  there s lots of energy somedays it gets purged very quick once that energys gone i feel mentally sick  it s like my generator s stopped working energy consumption is at a high replenishing that energy forces many lies  i can t make that  i can t make this i don t want to go here i d prefer to just miss   can we go back actually i don t feel too good it seemed like a good idea at the time until the rapid shift in my mood  back to safety it seems the comforts of home sometimes thats not enough i just want to be alone             i wrote this about a month ago.   never written anything before really   i just had an urge to be creative about the ongoing battle that i am facing.  it actually really helped.  i showed it to my partner and she burst into tears. it felt really nice that someone could understand how you felt just through a burst of creativity. it was warming.  if you get the chance and a creative moment pops up  capture it  you may feel better afterwards  even if it s a finger painting  ,2021-04-20 05:37:29
90383,i just had a huge fight with my sister yesterday. the whole time it was mostly just her yelling at me while i sat in silence and just took it. it gave me flashbacks to when my mom would take me for car rides just to yell at me. i don t know why but when i get super depressed i just get... quiet. really quiet. and it makes everyone around me more angry. they call me selfish  uncaring  and tell me i m ignoring them. they just keep filling the silence with their own angry and hurtful words. but i just feel like i m unable to form words. it just hurts  everything they say to me. but they still paint me as the bad person.   is it normal  to just become stone cold silent when you re depressed ,2020-12-14 13:45:07

37111,the first three days i literally haven t eaten a thing but the four last days i ve been forcing myself to eat a scrambled egg a day when i get out of bed at around 5pm and then i just spend the rest of the day playing video games or listening to music. i know that some of you experience loss of appetite too but i think this is the longest i ve lost my appetite and i just feel so physically weak on top of everything.,2020-06-06 07:34:32
5218,hello everybody. i wanted to know from you if the use of music during meditation could be enriching or could have had the opposite effect.  is there traditional content  old reading talking about it   or even modern scientific content talking about music in meditating   i thank you all ,2021-11-14 08:41:59

12593,i have severe depression and anxiety  and every day is like walking through sludge. i ve been medicated for this for about 7 years  i ve been seeing a new therapist and she s great... but it s so hard to motivate myself. today i managed to get up and have a shower.... only to get right back into bed and fall asleep until 2pm. i can t focus. i can t work. i m so easily distracted. i ve gone back to study  and i thought i was doing something i loved but now i just feel so apathetic and numb that i don t know how to conjure up any of the feelings i had when i applied for my programme. i honestly just want to sleep all the time. i don t know if it s a side effect of my medication  venlafaxine  or not  but i just feel so goddamn tired.   to make things a bit more difficult  my partner is extremely depressed for a lot of valid reasons  but can t get help because of finances. we re also unsure if it s actually depression or something else  they don t want to go on gp recommended meds until they re evaluated by a psychiatrist  which is extremely expensive. they refuse my offer of help  because i earn less than them  but i have at least one parent who actually cares about me enough to be helping me out with my therapy costs on the months i can t afford them. i m very lucky  i know  and i hate that my partners parents are actually wealthier than mine and yet don t give a shit about their kids mental health.   my partner had a breakdown tonight  which has become a fairly regular thing. they keep saying they think about killing themselves every single day. that i m the only thing keeping them alive. that there s nothing else to live for. i don t even know how to respond to this. part of me just freezes every single time. i love my partner  i do  but i feel like this heavy weight of responsibility just falls onto my shoulders every single time they say this  and it feels suffocating. i know this is because of my own depression and my own issues  but it makes everything so gd hard. i don t know how to help  i don t know what to say or do or think. i m struggling so much on my own  that i literally don t have the ability to pull someone else from that kind of darkness. i try my best  honestly i do. i try to push my shit to the side even for a moment  but i can never say anything right. i can never seem to pull them out of it.   i m scared to talk to people about it because everyone  says you can t be in a relationship with another depressed person  and i know that to an extent there is some truth in that... it definitely opens the gates for more toxicity  dependency  and fear. but at the same time  having someone who understands what you re going through  not freak out when you have your bad days  empathise when you re low and never judge you for how your feeling is the best thing. i m not judging my partner for having these breakdowns  it s just that i m so scared for them. i m scared they ll never get help. i m constantly worried and trying to figure out a way to get them to go to therapy. we ve made a deal that if the suicidal thoughts get too much and too real that we will always always talk to each other and never do anything without that conversation. i know people get caught up in moments but i know they would honour that promise.   i don t really know why i m posting this here  i just feel so helpless. all the time. i don t know what to do. i just want both of us to be better. i m scared that people will think i m in a relationship that s doomed  i m scared that i m actually in a relationship that s doomed  i m scared that i m one of those people who is waiting for their partner to  change    i never want to be this person  and in my mind i m not waiting for them to change  i want them to get help and try to learn to cope with how shit the world is.   anyway. tldr  i m diagnosed and medicated for  depression  my partner s severely depressed but could potentially have something else going on up there  and i don t know how to keep afloat. i love them and want to make it work.,2020-03-10 12:04:32
9826,inconsistent or lack of eye contact is often the main cause of awkward encounters. if you become mindful of this and make the effort to hold eye contact during conversation  people will be much more receptive to you  and you will find it easier to interact with others as you keep leveling up your skill in eye contact.,2021-11-26 20:55:26

155101,when you dislike someone  you make a choice to not be around them. you don t want to see their face. you don t like the way they act. hearing someone else speaking nice about them makes you cringe because you just don t see them like that. they re an awful person  you hate them but it s okay because you re safe  you ve cut ties and they will never have to ruin your day again. what if the person is you  yourself  and there is no escape  no place to hide  what then ,2021-08-06 11:05:44

101859,might sound dramatic but i feel like it s an endless cycle of not practicing proper hygiene because i m depressed and then becoming more depressed because i m literally a disgusting slob. i haven t showered for a week and i have no motivation to do so. i should have washed my clothes today but i haven t. i feel like im aging faster because i don t take care of my skin and it looks rough. i m sorry for making you read this. i hate myself and i feel stuck.,2021-01-17 02:00:46
2214,living in the past and future means that while you re taking a shower or bath  instead of enjoying the feel of the water on your skin and the slippery soap bubbles  the fresh soap smell of the present moment  instead of all that you occupy your mind with what happened at work  or with what you want to do tomorrow  or the chewing you got from your boss  or what am i going to get him  or her  for his birthday         present moment  folks  keep that inner being awake and stop... smell the flowers and that fresh  clean soap you wash with   ,2021-05-27 02:04:51
44504,i m at a point where idk what to do. i ve been single for 15 years. i ve dated but nothing stuck. idk what s wrong with me. why no woman wants to be around me unless it s solely benefits her. like for money or a favor or food. i dont get checked on. i m crying while writing this because i feel like if i cant do things for people nobody wants to be around. idk ifs because i m short or fat or what. no woman wants to be around me. none wants to fuck me. none wants to love me. before i continue i love myself i think i m attractive and have things to offer. but after what happen tonight it s taking me to thoughts of suicide. i dont feel loved or wanted . i m 34 years old and as my friends  and siblings are moving to their homes and having children and getting married i feel left out.    i dont want to go to events because everybody is coupled up and i m just there. i know people will say  you gotta love yourself  i do. or  it s not that serious  . my mom kidnapped then abandoned me like left in the middle of the night leaving me alone literally abandonment. i just want a woman to love me and be there. idk what to do. fuck a therapist not saying they don t work but i dont need to talk i need love.    i hate the place i m in and the way i m thinking. i m normally a happy guy although i never really thought of killing myself much before tonight. it s like everything from the past hit me at once and i just broke down and can t stop. i just want to be loved. i dont think i m asking for much. if i say what the straw was that broke the camels back y all would say it s not that deep. but years of being used made this come to the surface. i hope everyone who reads this is well and positive and have love. i hope to have that one day.... thanks for reading,2020-07-02 02:54:50
17883,contrary to excitement  i m way more depressed than ever. my birthday is in a few days time ... even mentioning the word  bring me to tears.   i don t deserve this life. i wished my mum saved the effort of giving birth to me. my parents could have saved the money  and go on whatever holidays they wanted.   instead... they chose to give birth to something useless  something they can t depend on and something they regretted on making. there isn t even love between them anymore.   i don t even have close friends who i can talk to  or who even has time to bother about me. i don t hang out with anyone neither.   my boyfriend couldn t bother to even text me.   why do i even live.   i ve been crying for hours  days  years. been making any change in my life that could turn it around but i ve been falling deeper than ever.   there s just no hope in living.,2020-03-30 12:41:05
9626,if  when  they try to shift your pay or days hours you work at a later date to take advantage of you  you will have recorded information evidence for anything they tell you contrary to your agreements. also take pictures of any agreements you sign before turning.  an additional tip  if harassed or gaslighted over time  keep a notebook with dates and names and details of what happened. it is a written history of documentation of behaviors and will be of huge help to you if anything happens down the line.,2021-11-21 10:38:13

2929,do you know what it s like to always wonder  to always worry  to always fear  to always wander in your mind. do you know what it s like to cry because you have no one  or what it s like to want to die because there is no one  and do you ever wish you had someone but all you do is avoid everyone.,2020-02-10 07:39:52
180789,i don t think i d ever actually do it  but just the thought is comforting. i m not religious particularly  but i pray all the time that if there s a god out there if they can fix me or maybe erase me from existence. there s no fixing me though  i ve tried countless times  i m not a good person  i ve done horrible things that i deeply regret. i want to change so badly  but i m stuck in a loop when i try to get better i fall back down again and again and again. why must my own thoughts torment me  why do i believe these thoughts no matter how much i try and believe they aren t factual  i didn t ask to be born into a family with a track record of mental illness. my school years consisted of me desperately trying to not let my anxiety overpower me  but i couldn t overcome it  it controlled every aspect of my life. so many missed friendships and relationships. sure i ve gotten better and even worked jobs in retail  but its still there and on top of that i m depressed. if i could hit a button and delete myself from ever being born so my family and friends would feel no pain if i left  i would.,2021-11-06 01:50:58
146754,have you ever went against something you ve been saying for a long time  it feels like i m telling myself lies. just recently i started watching videos about biology  and deformations in the human body. these videos showed real dissections of human bodies. it sank in  like really hard  harder than it has before. we will all die. this laptop that i am typing on means nothing  every hello or greeting i say will mean nothing. i will be a pile of ash or bones in a coffin or vase. flies will eat away at my rotting flesh  worms will bit by bit eat my bones. i m not even going to war. i tried searching for when we will be immortal and no answers came up. i m trying so hard to not die  but at times i tell myself that i should lay down and die. i ve tried to focus on other things  i tried watching meme comps on youtube. i tried listening to music and going outside. i wanted to get caught up on life residuals  i wanted to see the beauty of nature to heal and cope. but it s chaotic  at least humanity is. you don t see other animals doing what we do. so many of us have different experiences and memories. there are things i want to experience for myself. but won t be able to within whatever time i have left. the worst part is i think my life span has decreased  i inhale at least 32mg of weed  i don t smoke but i hang with people who do smoke . i am fat  i weigh in at 197 pounds  i have no real friends and that s shown to decrease lifespans. i m honestly concerned about my health  i can t look at the sky anymore without thinking of death   i won t be able to see clouds anymore .,2021-07-07 20:34:12

97637,for 2 years or so now  i ve gotten this empty  sad void in my chest constantly. i have no idea why it comes  even when i don t have a reason to be sad it feels like there s a hole in my heart  and i feel like crying for no reason. i just feel empty and all i can do to make the feeling lessen is distract myself.  i also don t have the energy to do anything anymore  i don t feel interested in anything and even when i do feel interested i don t have the energy to do so. i can t even get myself to go shower a lot of the time  i just... don t have the motivation. i don t feel like pursuing any hobbies majority of the time either  and i can t get any of my homework done in time. i just lie around in bed all day doing nothing but browsing through reddit or twitter or something.  the only thing that really makes me happy or excited is fiction  so i tend to hyperfixate on it a lot to forget reality. sometimes it even gets to the point where i feel horrible and upset when i don t currently have a series or character to fixate on.  i also have bad self esteem  i look in the mirror and i can t imagine anyone actually loving me for me  so i have to create a fictional world i ll be reincarnated into after death in my head where i don t have any of the flaws i currently do  and i find love and happiness there. i really can t imagine anyone being able to love my current self.   i also have a crippling fear of growing up and becoming an adult  i m almost 17 and the thought that i ll be considered an adult in an year is absolutely terrifying to me because i don t feel ready at all  i still feel like a lonely child  i don t feel like i m emotionally mature enough to be considered an adult.  am i depressed  do i need to see a professional about this ,2021-01-04 17:10:57

62365,everything thats a given to normal people will never happen to me just because i was born with an ugly face.  teenage love  missed out on  romantic moments  will never happen  having someone accept you as a person  not even worth considering  the worst is that no one really cares about ugly people. no one fights for them. no movement like blm or feminism. why  because we re not desirable and are meant to be breed out of the gene pool.  the more time that goes on. the more my chances will waste away. i just want someone to cuddle with. someone i can feel comfortable talking about my problems with and is comfortable sharing their problems with me. i just want love. but it will never happen,2020-09-06 14:05:22
4537,source  i work in medical coding.   for example  i see a lot of orthopedic patients and all the surgeries i have seen have a 90 day global period. these patients usually have follow up appointments at 2 weeks  6 weeks  3 months  6 months  1 year  and 2 years after surgery  depending on the surgery. this tip only really applies to the 3 month appointment  but if you can get it in within 90 days after the date of surgery  you can save some money on a follow up appointment.,2021-07-03 19:25:55
2289,i listen to the sam harris waking up app.   i have been meditating daily for the last 2 3 months and i still have a hard time understanding how to  observe the thought .   when a thought comes to mind and i try to observe it i usually just think the thought over and  watch  the words in my minds eye.   for example if i m getting angry or worked up about a thought while i am meditating i picture my anger as a word  cloud that s says  angry  or as a person who personifies my anger.   i just don t feel like i am feeling the way i should be when i observe the thought.  i feel like i should be able to visualize what s bothering me and be able to let it go in some way but i still feel something and can t let go completely.   from my understanding  observing the thought is supposed to help let it go because it unravels when you  observe  it but i just don t think i am experiencing that.,2021-05-30 13:55:43
52239,hey all  even if you don t have any advice for me  i appreciate anyone who reads this because i really need to get this off my chest  i went to the same university for undergraduate  2015 2019  and graduate school  2019 2020  and i m going to be graduating with my masters in a few weeks  summer semester . i guess to put a positive aspect to this post  i m the second in my family to graduate with a bachelor s degree and the first to graduate with a masters.  i m super introverted and i never really had any close friends growing up  i struggled with loneliness a lot. i always felt like i was the weird kid. i had some friends acquaintances in high school  but they all cut me off when i started college  none of them went to the same college as me . when i started college  i was able to break out of my shell and make a ton of friends over the years. my college friends were more of a family to me than my actual family was  and i always make sure to let them know how much i love and appreciate them. because of this reason  i m feeling really sad about leaving. i ve busted out crying at least a few times today just thinking about it and i m sure it ll get worse as the move out day approaches. it doesn t help that i wasn t able to give a good chunk of them the goodbye they deserve because of covid.  i ve been job searching and have gotten some offers  but i still want to keep my options open  i m moving back home with my parents temporarily  2.5 hour drive away from my university  i don t really get along with my parents so i m not looking forward to that either  basically what i m trying to say is that preparing to move out made me realize that this chapter of my life is ending and i m really scared about what s going to happen next. all of my friends are either going to be still at the university taking courses or they re graduated and all over the state country  i have 0 friends back home. i definitely want to visit my friends at school sometimes when it s safe to do so  but i m still sad. i m also scared that my relationship with my college friends will end up like my high school friends. any tips on how to cope with this life change is welcome because i m clearly not coping very well,2020-07-29 20:48:04
3143,has anyone else noticed how natural life acts when you meditate  either it s my insight and attention changed to notice what was always there  or natural life picks up on your vibes. if i m meditating out in nature i notice a lot more insects landing on me and just sitting there  or a butterfly will flap nearer and nearer  birds seem to settle in around you when they tell you re not a threat to them. feels like a scene out of snow white hahah.,2021-07-14 11:47:45

36467,i suppress my emotions. it s an instinct  i do it without even realizing. probably related to that  i can get too emotionally invested in fiction  tv  books  movies  stories i make up  etc .  you can see where this is going. i finished rewatching avatar  the last airbender. first i felt sad that it was over and i wouldn t get to see more of these characters. then i wished to be in a world like that  where shitty things happen but it  will  be ok in the end.  then i reminded myself that if i was in that world i would still be me. no friends  no skills  no purpose or goal. and that opened the floodgates to all the depression and fear and anxiety and self hate i ve been holding back. there s so much  i feel its oppressive weight physically pushing down on my body. i can only take short breaths. it s overwhelming and claustrophobic. i can t take a walk outside for space and fresh air because the whole city is under mandatory curfew. there s so much anger and sadness and uncertainty i ve been holding back  that the protests and the riots and the injustice happening around me are only minor issues. 6 months of feelings  including dealing with a pandemic and graduating college  all crashing down on me right now. so now i gotta deal with that  and the fact that life won t be a wholesome journey where things wrap up nicely and the future looks bright. i m not even going to mention,2020-06-04 01:16:09

2742,i m 28f and i haven t been in many relationships because i haven t found anyone i wanted to be in one with lately. i ve had my fair share of short term relationships and often vent to my best friend  also 28f  about my struggles in finding a guy i can have feelings for long term. i was dating my ex  whom my best friend met  and she was never supportive of me seeing him. when i asked her if she liked him after we broke up she confirmed she didn t and said it was because she felt i could do better than him and she wanted what s best for me and that s why she made it obvious she didn t like him. i was more successful than this ex   but i don t think i d dislike my friends bf for my friend being more successful.  i have recently started dating a new guy and it s been a little over a month. we get along like a house on fire  work in the same industry and he s very successful. i was telling my best friend about him and it seems as soon as i told him how successful he was  she immediately asked for his linkedin  asks me who pays for our dates  and said there must be something wrong with him if he s single at our age. i was really shocked by her response  i thought she would be happy for me. she seemed to cheer me on more when i was with the most toxic guy  saying she hopes i work things out with him whenever i told her my problems. i didn t say anything but now it s bothering me or am i overreacting ,2021-06-02 09:37:03
103236,this is my first post on reddit. spent an entire year lurking  and after seeing something concerning on someone s snapchat story a moment ago  i figured this was a good place to start.  i know a girl who s about 3 years younger than me  19 and 22   and though i don t know her in real life  met on instagram  i consider us good friends. earlier this evening she started up a private story on her snapchat dedicated to exposing all the pedophiles and creeps who try to contact her for sexual favors and all that sort of stuff. she s a pretty attractive person so it didn t really surprise me that she was getting all this attention. but on one of her snaps where she explains that she removes the supposed pedophiles right after exposing them  the picture on the snap is a picture of the wall in her bedroom  and towards the bottom of the picture you can see her legs. from just above her knees all the way up to the mid part of her thighs  there s a bunch of cuts. they don t look like scars  they look almost like scabs  like theyre recently closed. they all look the same in length and don t look like an injury of any kind  they look very much self inflicted  i know about depression  i ve had it for as long as i can remember  so you d think i d know how to respond to this but i don t. i need help reaching out to her. i know she s obviously not okay  and i want to help her without accidentally hurting her or straining our relationship. any advice ,2021-01-21 00:24:38

209,recently  i been thinking about the ancient people. how do they know 1 hour  if they are doing their meditation. it could be 40 minutes. it could be 1 and half hour. without using my smart phone  i can never be right about 60 minutes.  i start to experiment different app  different phone  and different way for my meditation time. i found a monkey mechanical timer for cooking. it turned out to be really good. it doesn t need battery. there is only one function. the monkey always happy. and the advertising image say  don t monkey around with your cooking time.  lol. it s definitely true with meditation. so many snake oil sales people monkey around with meditation time  so it s easier to sell their program and for them to make a dollar. it s the full monkey 60 minutes meditation or nothing.  if meditation become like another instant gratification or a product money can buy  it is then just like all the other junk.  how do you tell it s one hour  how about ancient people  any creative way  comment below...,2021-02-12 01:24:06
137096, i wish this world was more about doing good. but mostly its just about who has the most. the more you have the more urges you get to obtain more. sometimes someone will acctualy get what they really wanted. but in the shadow of that acoplishment  jealousy will form. the amount of worth you have is you bankacount.  i just hope that one day i will have what i want so that i can see who actually cared  have a great day,2021-06-03 04:17:50
76153,so earlier today i was texting with a friend of mine  who is also the only friend i have  and somehow we got to a bit depressing topics and she asked if everything was alright and that i can open up to her if i need to. so i opened up a bit  but not only did she then not respond to my text but decided to give her smartphone to her partner  who i only know very slightly  and let her just read the text i wrote her personally and let her send me other text messages on her account  bc she did something else. this was not the first time she told other people about things that i wanted to keep private. i don t know if i m overreacting here or not  but this just felt so bad for me. i rather keep these things to me from now on instead of having this,2020-10-30 16:06:53

420, responses needed   focused slow body movement s effects on the mind and body  hi  i m a college student writing a research paper on the effects of focused slow body movement on the mind and body.   my hypothesis is that slow movement decreases stress  anxiety  and improves your balance  all for similar reasons as yoga  meditation  and weighted blankets do. i am at the point in creating my paper where i am needing input from other people  that s what this post is for.    if you could answer the following i would appreciate it immensely.      interview questions       what is your credential for making your claim    practicer  researcher  instructor  expert ...     what is your current belief about slow movement and its effects if any       what caused you to form this belief            are there any precursors to that    what do you think a person fully committed to practicing slow movement would be doing every day         is that a life to be envious of  why why not            if not  what is to be taken from that example and what is to be left    what sources or experiences do you have to back up your claim    do you currently practice any slow movement exercises    have you heard of anyone using heavy jewelry for the purpose of balance slowness    what does stopping to smell the roses look like to you    what adjustments should we make to our fast paced society  if any         as someone in the                  field  what have you done or could you do to spread awareness to your claim            what have you done    do you have anything else to add ,2021-02-20 22:05:32

160795,hey guys   this is kind of a strange topic to bring up  but it s something i ve been wrestling with for awhile now. i have struggled severely with depression  anxiety  eating disorders  and self harm since the age of 14. i had 3 suicide attempts during my high school years and starting missing school because of panic attacks. i ended up missing so many days that i became truant and had to repeat my junior year. during this time period  i tried many different types of treatments. cognitive behavioral therapy  every type of ssri or snri you can think of. i stayed at in patient treatment centers for months at a time. nothing worked for me. nothing worked that is  until i accidentally got pregnant at 17.   when i found out i was pregnant  my mental state completely transformed. i decided to keep my baby  and suddenly i changed from being completely focused on myself  to focusing on my baby. for the first time  i felt relief from the depression  anxiety  and the eating disorders. i ate whatever i wanted during my pregnancy  and for the first time  i didn t hate myself. i completely stopped self harming  even though that had always been my main coping mechanism.  after i gave birth and was able to hold my son for the first time  i felt this extreme euphoria that took over my entire body. i could never describe it to someone who hasn t experienced it  but it felt like the most incredible high as though i had taken the best drug on earth. this lasted for days and days. i couldn t sleep in the hospital because i was so happy. i just stared at my son for hours while he was sleeping. i have never been this happy again since.   this happiness continued after i brought my son home. i was so focused on him and it became my passion to be his mother. taking care of him was a full time job  but i loved doing it. i didn t even mind getting up at night with him. my depression and anxiety went away for a long  long time. only as my son starting growing up  did i start to feel it slowly creeping back in. now my son is 8 years old  and the depression has come back full force. it s worse now than it ever was before. i m constantly thinking about ways to kill myself and i haven t left the house in 2 years. every single day is a battle just to make myself get out of bed.   a big part of me wonders if getting pregnant again  and having another baby  would fix me  just like it did the first time  i want to have another baby so badly because i feel like that s the only thing that will make the depression go away. but i know that it s wrong to have a baby for that reason. i m not in a stable position in my life financially  either. my husband is totally against having another baby. he doesn t understand that it was the only time in my life when i felt normal and whole.  women of reddit  is this a normal thing  i feel crazy coming out and saying this  but i can t be the only one who has experienced this.,2021-08-26 12:38:24
199545,i don t want to be alive any longer. i want to disappear from this world. i m so done with everything. having to wake up for school  lack of sleep losing the people i love having to go to sports  arguing with friends. i m done. i don t want to do anything any longer. spending time with my family makes me happy but then i feel miserable again when i start to think that someday we might not be happy anymore.i m ready to end it but  it won t end the grief i feel it will just pass it on. my parents will be miserable. my sister won t be able to handle it. my friends won t be able to understand why it happened. i don t want to leave them all like that but  i no longer want to be alive. maybe in the future i ll have a reason to hold on and something that makes me happy but  right now i have no idea what else to do. i want to cry and yell and cut myself. yet  i can t because i don t want to worry anyone around me.,2022-01-15 21:00:59

1011,more and more places require pets  especially dogs  to be microchipped. even where not mandatory  this can be a crucial step in helping carers and pets reunite in case the pet goes missing. since the pandemic  there has been an uptick in  dog nappings  due to a rise in demand for pets. dogs are stolen from their owners and sold to a new home  often unfortunately with no questions asked from the buyers.     here s what you can do to have a quick action plan in case your pet goes missing       all of the below applies to microchipped pets. i will be using the uk for example purposes only. please  research the applicable regulations and providers in your country of residence.     amp  x200b       once your pet is microchipped  ensure to register its chip number online and link it to your contact details. there are a lot of providers out there  so please research carefully before you make your choice.         as an example  you can find a list of providers in the uk that comply with government regulations  defra    https   www.gov.uk get your dog microchipped  https   www.gov.uk get your dog microchipped        the best way to choose a provider is to check that it complies with your local government regulations concerning pet microchips  most government websites would have some information concerning this published  and check their customer reviews.       it is not unusual to have a one off small registration fee per pet  using a uk provider as an example  this is gbp 12  and a small fee if your address changes  the same uk provider would charge gbp 6 for this . there are no other costs involved for a basic membership.  example used   https   www.pettrac.co.uk   https   www.pettrac.co.uk        important  ensure that you always keep your details  phone number  email  physical address  up to date in the pet microchip registry        save the contact details of the pet microchip registry in your phone. many of them offer 24 7 lost and found support numbers which is vital to have in case your pet goes missing.        if the microchip registry offers a 24 7 lost and found hotline  it is wise to have your pet wear a collar that has its name  microchip number  and the 24 7 number engraved on it.         this way if your pet is lost and someone finds it  they will have a  usually free  number to call that will be answered 24 7  and you will not have to give out your private details to unknown persons or get a new collar every time your details change. the registry will contact you and help you reunite with your pet.      ensure your current vet knows the microchip number  in case they weren t the ones who implanted it  and the provider where your pet is registered. ask them to save this information on your pet s record.      if your pet is prone to running away going missing or if you are especially worried  you can take these few additional steps so you have a complete plan of action  which hopefully you will not need        create a  missing  poster on your computer in advance  including the microchip number and 24 7 freephone number to call if applicable  so all you have to do is share it if needed.     make a list of where you would want to share the poster. do you want to print it out and post it in your neighborhood  do you want to post it in certain groups on social media specific to your area   missing pets  do you want to send it out to all nearby vets  have a list handy so if you need to  activate  your plan  you already know where you want to share your poster.    this way you already took some essential precautionary measures to increase your chances of locating your pet in case it goes missing. usually when such things happen  one tends to panic and other than searching the local area  doesn t know where to begin.   by taking the above steps in advance  you could put your mind at ease  a bit  knowing exactly what number to call to report your pet as missing and that if they are found  you have done everything possible to have them be swiftly reunited with you.   disclaimer  even by taking the above steps  there is no guarantee that every lost pet will be found. however  the chances of it increase significantly and may give you some peace of mind knowing that you have a concise plan of action for this scenario.   i hope this is of some help or at the very least offered some food for thought ,2021-03-16 06:32:57

89398,  i ve been having ongoing depression related to ptsd for a while. i guess i just need some place to put all this.   i was born to drug addicts. meth  cocaine  uppers of any sort is what my mom told me she preferred. my dad preferred meth.   he also preferred me to be a boy  and he hated me because i was a female. he would sexually and physically abuse me  always careful to not leave marks. he would put his hand over my face and mouth until my vision turned to black static  telling me i was useless  worthless and lazy. he told me it was his job to show me my place. he would wait until i was focusing on something  a book  a movie and come up and slap me or punch me in the back of my head and pull my hair. he would wait for me to fall asleep and put his hand over my mouth and nose. he would tell me  you females should all just die  especially you and your whore mom  and he would laugh while beating me with a belt. i learned early on he liked me crying so i wouldn t give in and then he would just go more and more at me. one time he got a needle and held me down saying he would blind me forever. telling me if i don t do what he says exactly  he s going to let me live but disable me forever.    when i complained to my mom  she told me various things like  deal with it    suck it up    you ll get over it.  i still remember i was 6 when i asked her why she stayed with him  she gave me a look like i was horrible and so full of contempt  like i was a bad person. she treated me like i was shit on the bottom of her shoe after that. i don t remember her ever giving me hugs to console me when i was in emotional pain  just telling me i ll get over it and that it ll pass.   i guess i told my 1st grade teacher i was being abused  so she called my parents. my parents convinced her i was lying.   i spent most of my time hyper focused on books and school work. by the time i was in 3rd grade  i picked up every book i could my mom had. dean koontz  james patterson  gone with the wind. i don t remember much about being at home other than when i was alone   reading my books. or sometimes doing my best to hide. i hid under my bed  or my wardrobe and i remember sometimes just staying in the park until late at night and sneaking home to sleep in bed after i knew my parents were sleeping.  when i was 11  i attempted suicide after a bout with my father. i took a half a family sized bottle of ibruprofen  and spent what felt like a week vomiting and feeling like my veins were on fire. i always wondered why she didn t take me to the hospital. she said  i didn t know what to think . but the ibruprofen was halfway gone right after she had just bought it  and i was sick. my mom later on when i was around 23 told me she was going to let me die. she was going to let me die and it would all just be over for her. she didn t have to worry about  being caught  and she d just be in jail and it would all be over. her exact words.  i m 31 now and i spent my life making excuses for my mom. trying to protect her and acting like she s the victim because that s how she always acts  and i believed it. i believed it until i had a child of my own. now i don t even know what to do. my mom acts reasonable but she still blames me  dismisses me and acts like she never did anything wrong. when i try to bring it up  she plays like she s a victim  and it s up to me to let it all go and move on.   i was so functional and happy for two years after giving birth. i did really good. and then i had a surgery that i learned i had opiate resistance  it was extremely painful when i woke up and it was only 5 minutes of pain before they knocked me out with versed but it felt like forever and my ptsd came back with a vengeance.   i feel so much anger at my mom now. i know she knew  but she turned away and was always so cold and distant to me unless she felt like being otherwise. she would tell me i am crazy and i made it all up. she even convinced multiple therapists of this. she helped my dad lie over and over.   i spent 3 years as a teenager in and out of the hospital  one stint was a year and a half long wherein i was diagnosed with schizophrenia. i was put on so much medication   i was on thorazine  valium  zyprexa and ambien all at the same time  plus 10 more. i took 23 pills a day  and i was basically one level above comatose. people treated and spoke to me as though i was mentally deficient. my therapist thought i believed i was abused  but believed my parents that they never abused me so decided i hallucinated it all.  i do not have schizophrenia. i do not hallucinate nor do i have any delusions despite currently being on no psychiatric medication.  i have tried every medication available to me. i recently had to stop taking cymbalta because it effected my tachycardia and i could not keep taking it or risk a heart attack. it s the only medication i have ever found that helped me.  i feel so hopeless  i feel so helpless. i have a 5 year old daughter and i do everything i can to spend time with her but sometimes  i am gone. my brain cannot handle being present.  sometimes i spend all day smelling a chemical smell i can t explain  no one else smells it. like a constant flashback somehow. my brain is a vortex of despair and no matter how much i try to stop it  it won t stop.   i try to function and i just have to go back to zoning out and i m just a constant zombie. i m just extremely depressed. i don t know what to do and i worry that my parents were both right. i m useless  crazy  and i ll never escape my past even though i ve spent years in therapy and on medication trying to be a normal  sane human being. i don t know why i posted this  i know many people won t read it because i type a lot. i write it. i write a lot. but i m lost   and i want to do better for my daughter and i feel like i can t no matter what i do.,2020-12-11 20:23:02
162594, i ve come here a hundred times. i don t know for how much longer i can spin this tale of sorrow  not even the sympathy makes it easier to stomach anymore  no doubt you re all sick of my drivel as much as i am. but  what better choice do i have  let depression eat me inside out from the gut  like a spider  i ve been a leech my entire life  sister  kind as i try to be. this is no different  though it only gets harder with each passing day   like a senior  no longer able to bend their legs back as they used to.  i m in agony right now. i never asked to be born  and if i knew what being born entailed  i would ve strangled myself with my own umbilical cord. every day  i bear the weight of being a living failure  i can t accurately describe just how painful it is to know what a shambles your life is but not having the strength to change it  so you spend your days living in petty escapism. i ve given up on my dreams. they re there  still burning bright in my mind  but i know i ll never reach them.   ...death scares me. it scares me so much thinking about everything just  ending. but right now  it still scares me  but i see it as a partner to free me from my suffering.  no no no no  that s it  i can t keep it up with the fucking fancy schmancy snob talk anymore. it physically hurts trying to phrase how terrible this sensation is in an artistic way  especially knowing this is going to be buried in the sands of time and the waves of people with similar problems who are better than me in every way. like seriously  look at everyone here right now. take a big gander. brave people  right  take a look at the outside world  how many success stories of people in dark places pulling themselves up into greatness there are. there s so much value in every single person  heroes   now look at me. useless. worthless. i ve tried. oh have i tried. i ve sat. i ve sat for hours. i ve stared at screens. i ve stared battering myself into oblivion just to write a few words. but nothing ever comes of it. what comes of my life  i sit around draining my parents. i drain my teachers. i drain you  i m making you all my bitches and i hate it  but there s nothing else i can do. oh what  i m funny    i m caring    hmmm i don t know  that s not going to pay the bills  that s not giving my life meaning  i still feel like complete shit    right now i just want to die. death scares the absolute fuck out of me  and though i cling onto life  i d appreciate the agony of existence just  disappearing. six years of fighting this demon thus far  and it s not gotten easier. i ve just gotten more exhausted. and i have nothing to show for it  minus a meager bit of progress. still a burden though.  i was trying my hardest not to be a whiny bitch but i had to.  no  i can t handle it. i m stopping it here.  i m going to bed and crying now.   bye.,2021-09-01 23:04:40

22629,i m sure this whole shitty situation has been bad for everyone  and i m no exception. it s put into perspective just how shitty my existence really is. i ve never been the most social person  i ve had depression from a young age which didn t help  but i was antisocial before that. i hadn t realised just how truly alone i am until the quarantine started  because my routine suffered absolutely no changes. i ve realised that i have no real friends or relationships  that i never go out or hardly leave the house  that i sometimes spent days without talking to anyone even when the virus hadn t hit. no job  no school  no goals or purpose behind it all  just a sad excuse of a human being wasting his time away on this earth by eating and jacking off. i ve felt like this for a while  but the reason i m venting here is because a question won t stop echoing in my head   would it really count as taking my own life if i don t have one in the first place  ,2020-04-17 03:30:50
95212, hello everyone  first time poster on reddit.  back when i was 17 19 i felt life was great  i took part in hobbies i thought i genuinely enjoyed   had friends in those hobbies  goals and aspirations. i went to college and completed school  then went back working for the family business  business got extremely busy when i returned from college. when this happened i stopped most hobbies and living outside of the business activities  things got even more busy  one day my father had a massive heart attack in the office and passed away instantly. myself and my mother ran the business after that day for a year  it remained incredibly busy and i was unable to handle the workload now that dad was gone. everything started to pile up and i couldn t keep going as we were  my mom is over 60 and she was ready to retire  at the time i didn t see a way to keep going and thought that it would be better to close down. we sent out a letter and closed the business sold assets and layed off 12 staff.   i cannot get over the idea of what i did by closing the business that my father worked his whole life building. everything was just getting good  all the years he worked hard for it was only in the last 3 that it was very profitable and allowed my mother the retirement she has today. i m working in another industry now  but i can never escape the thoughts of what could of been and the regrets i have of doing what i choose to do by closing instead of reaching out for help  finding a business mentor etc.   from the time i came out of college until now i haven t been passionate about anything  each day feels grey and fuzzy. i ve been telling myself for a long time now that is what adulthood is and i need to suck it up and move on  but i m not sure now this is what i m supposed to feel like  i get everything done and do a good job at my new profession but it s like in my mind i m doing it all for nothing.   when i daydream i think of the past days of being in business with my father and i make myself believe that i m almost in that same present day situation running the business  i ll search the internet and find equipment that would of worked great for us in the work we did  look at pricing and creep on old business competitors websites.   i still sometimes get out and do some old hobbies and hang out with friends but it s always empty  everything feels like a chore  it s emotionless and feels indifferent to me.  has anyone felt like this before  thank you for your time and i am interested to see if you feel this is apart of life adulthood or i should be looking at getting some type of help.,2020-12-29 00:06:06
188742,writing this after another fit of rage where i trashed my room and beat the shit out of my own face. i m 27  no job  no friends  no education  no romantic life  for the past 10 years ive done nothing but sit in my room and play video games and draw. i have an extremely low self esteem so i cant do anything on my own without panicking and self destructing. i don t know how to drive or do most basic adult things. i live with my dad and stepmom who baby me and will just let me sit in my room forever  i m losing it. i have no goals or interests and no motivation. i feel like a prisoner  i ve been fucked up since i was a kid and now that i m older everyone just acts like i should have basic skills even though i didnt have a chance to develop them as a child. any time i read about another 27 year old having multiple degrees or a job and a family i want to bash my skull into the wall until i cant feel anymore.  those are the worse aspects of me  i m not stupid or completely socially inept. i just hate having to interact with other people and feel like the world around me is just wrong. i feel like a prisoner in the body of a child that died long ago,2021-12-03 20:01:48

8906,often when people boil eggs they ll use a large amount of water  often times much more than required. this wastes both water and time by taking longer to boil.   you can fill the water just up to the point where it covers the egg  but you can also just fill it so that the eggs are partially submerged  so long as your pot has a lid to trap in steam the eggs cook fine.,2021-10-29 21:58:51

141,has anybody ever been buried  like at the beach in sand  head only thing above the ground  that s the closest thing i can relate how i ll feel at random times through the day  seemingly every day.   it s as if there s pressure all around  pushing in and down on you  but no matter how hard you try to struggle your stuck  exposed and immobilized. trapped  unable to break free from the binding pressure each day brings.  it s not as if the world is a dark and gloomy place  but i m unable to enjoy it. i m looking around noticing all my friends enjoying life  going to new places  meeting new people. but i can t.   i m tired  worn down  the same way you get after being in the sun all day and get a real bad sunburn. drained of energy. and every night i know that the next day  i ll be buried neck deep  trapped.  i don t wanna be trapped,2020-02-01 23:01:16

4325,when following a cookbook or online recipe you can very often double the amount of seasonings they suggest and or halve the amount of sugar. i m pretty sure that this applies to baking as well but someone more experienced in the science of baking can correct me if i m wrong.  basically recipes assume you re a pleb with a culinary palette the color of a food for less floor. therefore it expects that you will confuse sweet with quality and encourage you to add way too much. spices are considerably more expensive and so the recipe  assuming you re a culinary philistine  will lean into your natural inclination to use as little as possible. recipes tell you what they think you want to hear.   while it s true that spices are indeed expensive you will not regret doing two things  buying them fresh and using a lot of them.,2021-06-28 16:31:34
2156,i just want to drink until my body literally cannot function. i hate my life  apart from my job. my job keeps me going. i keep picking up extra shifts or staying longer cause i have nothing else. my first only meaningful relationship was nearly 3 years long and it was both physically and emotionally abusive. the next i was ghosted after being the best gf ever  imo . i m such an introvert and i know i wouldnt ever leave my house if it weren t for my job. i hate being neat others but being near myself is almost as bad. at the same time being alone is slowly killing me. i m not sure what else to do as i sit here on my second glass of crown,2020-02-07 20:06:22
8950,at our house   santa  fills the stockings and brings each kid   one   gift that s a total want  vs something they need   but nothing outrageously expensive. all of the other gifts come from mom and dad. with the concept of  santa brings presents to good boys and girls   i don t want to create the opportunity for my kids  gifts to make a friend feel he or she did not make the grade this year.  example  last year i was lucky enough to score a ps5 on release day  and i made it abundantly clear to the family that we got it because i researched  tracked it  and acted fast. if santa brought it  my son s friends would have wondered why they had been left out.,2021-10-31 08:57:37
5751,i started meditation last month to relieve stress and anxiety. i also suffer from muscle spasm whenever i get stressed. last night i took 4 grams of magic mushrooms and meditated for about 4 hours. i never felt this sense of relieve before. i was able to feel my muscle fibers relaxing one by one. i was able to focus for longer and i was more aware of the monkey mind. do you have any experience with this that you can share  any best practices ,2021-12-20 12:29:43
194949,i want to reach out to my therapist  but i have no money. even if i did get the money  one hour isn t enough. there are so many emotions and feelings going through my mind i can t keep up  and it would take years to resolve with my therapist. emotions are complicated  and processing them myself is hard. my thoughts feel like a bowl of spaghetti. they re all intermingled together  which makes it hard for me to think. i honestly don t fucking know. i also want to reach out to a man. it s like i need comfort from a man because i never really knew my dad. so i m also seeking a man s validation  protection  and comfort  which isn t healthy  and my therapist is fucking expensive.,2021-12-28 18:59:32

7840,if a friend introduces you to their friend group or however don t give up on it. stick around because relationship building takes time. it might feel like you re intruding or an outcast  but if you get past that stage by hanging out with them you ll be fine. spend time with the people individually and things like that.,2021-09-30 17:07:43
191347,hello    i would like to know if i have depression.   nothing in life makes me really happy  i m all time tired  i isolate myself  when i don t do anything  i just think and sometimes 1 things come back to me all the time.   i have no emotions  sometimes i pretend to smile. staying with people irritates me  things like games  animes  movies etc.  do not make me happy  even the other way around  they make me addicted  make me stressed  sweat etc.   have no problem  no sadness  no anger  i don t know where this depression is coming from if it is.  thx for your help   ,2021-12-13 15:27:03
60170,after a pretty intense fight with my girlfriend  i was feeling pretty low. today wasn t that great either  regardless. after the fight however  i talked to one of my friends and together we talked through some of my anger and emotional problems.   the realization  i ve been trying so long to be happy without doing anything positive.  i realized tonight that just wanting to be happy wasn t enough  but that in fact  i need to be more positive with myself. i need to look after my well being just as much as i do others. i need to make sure i m doing the thing i enjoy too. i need to say positive things to myself. and more importantly  i need to show others that i do have positive thoughts and feelings.   i spend so much time talking about the negative  without saying anything positive. that is changing tonight.  i dont know if anyone else will relate to this  just my personal depression journey   hope you re doing alright  and no matter what it will get better  ,2020-08-29 03:10:39

1540,the voice of babaji  chapter xi of  the voice of babaji a trilogy on kriya yoga   by v.t. neelakantan  s.a.a. ramaiah  babaji nagaraj.           the first paragraph on page 211 clearly shows how the one plane allows for freedom. in a single frame  every aspect is whole.          through the seeming conflict of the of the world  there is a plane which every one is in.   the light shineth in the darkness and the darkness understandeth it not   or close to the quote  don t remember exactly .  suffice it to say  the darkness is a mere shadow of light  with seeming consciousness.           yet  just as a shadow moves in reference to an object in the sun  it is not separate.  the plane is all encompassing.  for this reason  it is a privilege to be in.  to leave is to change the delegation of love and alter the character of a person.  for this reason  it is not a responsibility or a privilege to communicate with darkness  for in being darkness it has complete dictatorship of what vibration it is in  seemingly.           to communicate light to light is the method  for it is the only thing which is true. if apparent darkness is there  see it only in reference to light  for that what the apparent darkness is.  god is all   aum kriya babaji namaha  satguru deva namaste  satguru deva dayakapara  satguru deva kshama.            god is all do not give the darkness the privilege of your precious love. the god is all their mere vibration should be seen as such. allow the never ending clarity of light to be the in residence  do not listen or take queues from darkness  for it is acting in a single  vibration   not clarity  which is synonymous and the same as light.,2021-04-27 11:11:53

42035,hi  i ve had a lot of depressive episodes in my life and this one has begun a little while after covid  along with the worst anxiety of my life  i have social and general and am now having panic attacks everyday which involve crying and hyperventilating along with the unusual .   i had a breakdown tonight and usually i will be very sad empty and just crying wailing. this time i was angry and furious  had my anger breakdown and  also yelled my bf over something very very small. i m scared of myself. i punched a wall and scratched myself with my nails along my wrist and i can barely remember feeling either of them. i proceeded to have a panic attack and cry until i eventually calmed down.  i ve noticed anger has been bubbling inside me for the past month or so and it s starting to get out of hand and effect the way i interact with my bf when i m angry and i hate it.   i have an appt with my new psychologist  only had one session so far  on thursday  and don t know whether to tell her about this whole thing or not.   just wondering if anyone has experienced this before  i m generally a person who can remain very calm even when i have something substantial to be angry about  but lately every little thing is getting to me and making me angry as well as depressed.,2020-06-23 07:29:59
191827,she gets mad over the smallest things. so i ll correct my behavior and do what she asks. and then she just moves the goal posts and makes me feel bad about something else. i had to move back in with her because i couldn t afford to live on my own after covid hit. i was depressed for months and didn t get a job for a while. i was nannying part time but it wasn t a real job i guess  even though that s what she does. so i got a real job. in sales. super out of my comfort zone but i m making it work. i m doing it. it s hard  i m having to learn so much  but i m fucking doing it. and i m proud of myself for it. but it s not good enough for her. she complains about my cat s litter box  so i clean it every time she uses it. she complained about me not telling her when i was spending the night with my boyfriend. fair. so now i tell her every time. they wanted me to move out by january but my stepdad lost his job so now i have to pay the water and electricity. fine. on top of my new car note and phone. that s fine. but how am i supposed to save money to move out  whatever. i ll figure it out. i stayed with my boyfriend last night and let her know. this morning i wake up to her nagging me about shit i already took care of. she also started going on about how i need to learn to recognize  the ones who are there for me . because i m spending too much time with my boyfriend.  the way you do things for your boyfriend  i would like at least to received a cup of coffee from you.  ignoring that i fold her laundry for her regularly when she leaves it in the drier. i don t complain about it  nor am i doing it for recognition. just an example. i keep trying to meet her demands and she just keeps making other ones. i can never satisfy her. i stay with my boyfriend because he doesn t make me feel pressured or guilty for simply existing. i m twenty fucking seven. i m trying my hardest to get myself back to a point where i can live on my own. but just going to bed and waking up in an environment where i ll never be good enough is just so so draining. it just makes me sad.  all the while she tells me how i m the engine that keeps her going. she tells me how proud she is while nitpicking every little thing i do. it s so much fucking pressure. and if i talk to her about it i m just ungrateful and have no reason to feel this way. i hate it. i hate it so much.,2021-12-15 12:52:28
4007,i ve recently read  the mind illuminated  by culadasa and the author says that you should focus on the sensations of the breath exclusively at the nose  alternatively at the abdomen . i ve been meditating for about a year now  at least 15 min per day but i ve always focused on my breathing as a whole if that makes sense. is that also okay or should i try to focus on the breath at a specific location  thanks  ,2021-09-01 08:11:29
15710,it s a hard pill to swallow. when my mom was dying in the hospital the  love of my life  at the time decided she was just going to start having sex with another man. she even told me she didn t have the time or want to be any support to me. so really if you look at it logically. i m so undesirable that it s ok for someone to just kick me when i m down like that. it s ok to just shove me to the side while my last family member died. better to just start screwing someone else. move on and forget as fast as possible.   no one stepped up to help when i had to go pick out a coffin  pay for a plot and give a eulogy to a bunch of empty chairs.   i m here. i know that pisses off people but you have to deal with it. i m not going anywhere. you people are just going to have to live with that fact. i m not going to apologize for being who i am. i don t know why it seems to piss people off. i don t understand why i can never be more than a placeholder until a better man comes along. you re just going to have to deal with it.,2020-03-22 13:01:29

4437,i keep being amazed at how few people  especially students  have taken the time to do this.   at the average speed of 60wpm  you could type a 500 word essay in 8 10 minutes easily once you know what to write. it ll take you a about a month of practicing 45 minutes a day to reach that on average.      but it ll save you time in job applications  e mails  social media posts  ebay listings  pretty much anything you do in a computer  or typewriter  of course  will be easier and faster.       it s an investment in saving yourself precious time  not just a skill reserved for administrative jobs.,2021-07-01 09:33:49
198654,i ve just been slacking off for weeks  and sometimes i think i should get my shit together but i really have no big goals or dreams to work towards. life seems so pointless bcuz i don t have anything of importance to me to accomplish.   the  goals  i have to achieve now  are mandatory  and i m already so burnt out and exhausted. i just prefer to stay in my room all day  eat snacks  and distract myself from reality.  but i know i can t afford to do that much longer because i m at the age where i m expected to start having my life figured out. all my peers are off to college  being independent  having social lives  etc and i m at home rotting away in the same position i was in 4 years ago.  i just want it all to end. my life. i just don t want to be here  i genuinely don t see a good reason to stay. i don t feel like i m strong enough  to be here,2022-01-12 04:27:26
8458,my good female friend  i knew for 9 months now  stopped to replying to me 2 months ago. she told me something like  she has to bury herself with her problems. i was fine about it and didn t bother her. i finally decided to message her month later and she said she s alright  but she has no memory on her phone and she needs a new phone  because she can t use messenger. i was ok about it  but there s something strange. she s online every day  in the morning and in the evening  she changed her photo on profile like a few days ago and she s regularly posting on her facebook  but she does not respond to me message since month. if she has cannot use messenger on her phone  why she cannot reply to me on pc from facebook  she didn t even read my messages at all.   it s kinda tough to me and the reason why i m concerned about her is because i helped her to treat her traumas and supported her in tough times. she also helped me with my insecurities  but generally she was the one  who throw outside the most negative stuff.   i mean i m ready to give up on her  but i m concerned if she just used me or she really might be unable to reply.,2021-11-15 04:22:39
82966,i  22m  always thought i had add and was naturally demotivated. but tonight as i was talking to my mom i was wondering if i was depressed. i have always found that i don t feel anything. that i was always in neutral mode. that life was making the choices for me. and that no matter what the choice was  i was neither happy nor disappointed. i never felt any emotion coming to me and pushing me to accomplish anything. but i ve been like this for ages and i always told myself that this was the norm.  tonight  before going to bed  i was talking to my mother about an injury that happened to me almost a year ago. we were talking about how this injury has affected my life since the day it happened and how i still haven t been able to heal it. and during the discussion i felt this anger taking hold of me. i don t know what i was angry about or what caused this emotion. but i hadn t felt this for a very long time. maybe years. it gave me a lot of motivation to care about my injury and get my life back on track. it even seems like it put my add on hold and my lack of motivation is gone.   then  i started thinking about this sudden anger and wondering about the famous quote from master yi   anger gives motivation without purpose  which led me to stumble upon an other quote   depression is anger turned inward  and i wonder if what i had all these years  my add and lack of motivation to get shit done with my life  is actually a depression that i have had for all these years.,2020-11-23 00:32:09

158793,i just turned 30 this year and for the first time in my life i got a high paid job that i cared about. the problem is... yeah. my depression and anxiety issues which have gotten really very very bad last year. i went on medication last year and somehow manage to live my life  take showers  do laundry  socializem still not fully great with my everyday life but im not struggling as much.   the problem is any time i experience something stressful i get so anxious and scared that i keep on escaping it hoping it would go away. a shitty quality in a person who works writing emails...   so i keep on fucking up  nit answering people  forgetting things  basically being an anti employee of the month and im out of excuses. last night i got super sick and today i slept through the daily standup. i think everyone s super fed up with me. our main leader is on holidays now  but my two main supervisors just invited me to a call called  chitchat  and i think i might be getting fired.   i just feel like an absolute failure. i don t know how to overcome this overwhelming fear and stress connected with working. i get nauseous  my heart trembles  my stomach aches   because of an email. i feel old and inadequate  this kind of problem sounds like something a 22 yo could deal with me but not a 30yo with years of professional experience.    i just wonder if we have anyone here who got fired because of their shitty performance caused by mental issues and got back on their feet.   thank you.,2021-08-19 09:56:22

115242,can i just hit the rest button on life   all i do is wake up in the afternoon and play video games till 5 a.m. and repeat the process over and over again. all my friends have graduated college and here i am  almost two years later  still struggling to find the motivation to log onto my school website and complete an assignment that is graded for completion.  why can t i find the discipline to even commit 10  of myself to my own schoolwork  all i want to do is play video games and it honestly drives me nuts.   even then  i have been doing well in most of my classes except the one class i need to do well in to graduate. i even got a second chance by my professor to complete all my assignments by friday even though they are super late. but then here i am  procrastinating for the third day in a row without even a hint of motivation to even complete them.   i just feel hopeless and want to kill myself and i feel like this is my last resort for help as i might as well not be alive if i cannot graduate from college. i would love any recommendations on being in the right mindset to focus on school.,2021-03-09 14:41:43
63118,in my first year of college i became severely depressed for certain reasons  nothing traumatic  i ended up losing all self confidence by spending over   200 hours on this project and it ended up failing  so all of that time i put in felt wasted. i was already very lazy unproductive before  but this just destroyed my self confidence and i stopped doing anything besides the minimum schoolwork to keep a good gpa . i basically spent the next 2 years of college doing absolutely nothing with my life. i have this mentality where i can do the minimum amount of work needed to  survive  which in my mind is keeping a 3.7  gpa so that i can get a good software engineering job and be comfortable. anything lower than this would feel like death to me  so my mind is somehow able to function enough to do well in school no matter how depressed i am. but when it comes to my dreams  passions  and hobbies  my brain does not give a single f  ck. i really do care   i always used to work on fun side projects and hobbies during high school  but after depression settled in high school i completely shut down. i literally finished all my college work in   2 hours in the morning and spent the entire rest of the day on youtube or manga. i never even read manga before  but after i realized that youtube got boring after a few hours  i literally adapted to increased my laziness and picked up manga as another time waster. as soon as it s time to sleep or i have some work to do  i would break out of this temporary brain distraction and realize that i had a real life to live and remember all the things i actually wanted to do. i just kept getting better at escaping by sinking myself further into the digital entertainment world of youtube  netflix  and manga webtoons.  now it s been around 2 years  and i feel horrible that i did absolutely nothing to them. sometimes i feel better by saying that regrets aren t logical and that things can be better if i change right now   but i literally can t for some reason. i actually took a few therapy sessions   6 months ago and i felt great for a week or two and thought i was cured. it very  very slowly crept back over 2 months and it was so gradual that by the time i realized i was depressed  i was too depressed to bother getting therapist appointments again. it doesn t really make any sense. i actually decided to finally book an appointment a few weeks ago. it s literally just a few clicks away because i just have to send an email and setup a time. i really want to book the appointment  but something is just stopping me. i mentally just reel away at the thought of booking the appointment and instinctively switch to some youtube or manga site to numb myself.  but here s the actual part i wanted to talk about. the depression feels different this time around. before  i would feel sad. i would constantly remind myself that i need to change and feel bad about it. now  i just feel numb. my suspicion is that it s because back then i was at college and was independent  so i knew i had to change. now that i m at home because classes switched to online from covid  i feel so comfortable with my family to support me and a steady education that i feel  complacent  with this shitty version of myself which makes me mad. i think subconsciously  i m getting completely complacent with this lazy version of myself because i know i can survive like this. even if i continue to barely work each day  i know i can work just enough to maintain my gpa and get a high paying engineering job  and since i don t  need  any of my hobbies to live a part of me just wants to throw all of it away and live this lazy worthless life.  before  i would wake up and know that at some point i would be able to recover even if i didn t know how it would be possible. now  i wake up and go to sleep feeling like this will never ever change and that i m permanently stuck like this. the part that scares me is that a part of me feels like i don t want to change  while the other is desperately screaming to fix everything. covid makes this feel even worse. before  i would at least have friends to meet with everyday that would remind me to at least do some sort of work and i would occasionally be able to start some hobby work  even if it was just for an hour. now  that s basically impossible. friends still text call but it s so easy for me to just ignore them that i actually end up doing that sometimes. any time i do talk to them  the positive effects are only like 1 10 and i don t really care about anything since it s all digital.  i literally feel like a dead soulless body with a rotting mind right now. i had an internship over the summer which was fun  but even then as soon as work was over at 5pm i would do absolutely nothing. now that the internship is over too and my school doesn t start until the end of this month  i ve had a solid 3 weeks of doing absolutely nothing. wake up  eat  watch read entertainment  play video games  sleep. i only feel truly happy energetic when i play smash bros for an hour or two with friends  and as soon as it ends i just feel stupid and brain dead again as i go switch back to passive entertainment. i feel like my eyesight has gotten worse in the past 2 weeks too and anytime i stop looking at my monitor i feel suffocated by the blurriness. i had glasses already but it was very minor  i only use it to watch tv  and i feel like it only got worse by very little  but the emotional toll and addiction to my laptop to numb myself is making this suffocation feel worse.    tldr    depression has slowly turned me into someone who cannot do any work besides the bare minimum to survive  schoolwork  job  and i can no longer do the hobbies i used to love so much. i had lots of goals outside of just getting a job  but i m not motivated to do anything even though i actively think and wish i could do them. can t even book my therapist appointment even though it would take me 2 minutes to setup  i m literally spending 10 minutes writing this on reddit instead of just booking the appointment . depression used to feel sad yet hopeful  now i feel devoid of emotion and i feel like this is the end and i can t change.  sorry for the really long post. just wrote everything i was feeling and wanted to be as descriptive as possible.,2020-09-09

200917,get medication and therapy. get medication and therapy. get medication and therapy. medication and therapy. medication and therapy. medication and therapy.  wait haven t you heard there is medication and therapy  you must be depressed because you haven t taken enough medication and therapy. now take your  shut up  pills  because your feelings are getting in the way of my desire to make you my loyal subordinate. slow down and you re out on the street. medication and therapy. you don t like working a thankless job in a dominance hierarchy that demands subordination above all else. you probably just haven t had enough medication or you need a therapist to explain to you that your employer domineering your life and robbing you of your dignity is an opportunity to follow your dream of being a servant. that was your dream right  no  medication and therapy.  for the record i have taken a few medications. they cause sexual dysfunction  withdrawals  one made me more suicidal  one caused me to lose consciousness when i stood up. therapy in my experience is only useful as a place to vent with someone who s legally required to keep it in confidence.  i m not making a political statement. humans are disgusting. everywhere they exist regardless of politics they build this dominance hierarchy so that some elite class can rule over a workforce that is expected to carry themselves and the ruling class or else. with massive double standards everywhere you look. you either have to hope that whoever you end up in servitude to is kind and fair or try and do the dominating yourself. chimpanzees do it too.  they call me lazy and entitled for not wanting to work under those conditions  but when i say i m fine with dying and that i don t expect anyone to carry me i m sent to the hospital by force if needed. almost like society needs me alive for pretty much the same reason slave owners didn t want the slaves dying. i don t want to participate anymore.,2022-01-21 09:42:06

127208,earlier this year i lost my grandfather. he was the best friend i had. i went into auto pilot throughout the two weeks following his death.  after about two weeks my dad had already gotten over the death. i  didnt want to do anything. i just wanted to sit home not go to school not do anything on my spring break i just didnt wanna do anything but die. one day i decided to attempt to kill myself by slitting the veins in my wrist so i could slowly and painfully die whilst feeling all the pain. my mother saved me but the knife she pulled out of my hand cut my finger and i had to go to the doctors to get stitches. about a week after that i started seeing a therapist. the thearapist is just an all around jackass to me though. he will say things like you crybaby stop it happened a long time ago. or why are you such a selfish freak trying to kill youself you fucking emo hippie. one day i had enough and he said something i will never forget  you wanna kill yourself. why dont you take another swing at that. i was furious and so were my parents. i stopped seeing him last week and to be honest im seriously connsidering doing what he told me to do.,2021-04-30 22:18:03

4468,i ve been practicing with the mind illuminated approach the last year or so  and find that it is a bit too complicated for me to fully appreciate at this point in time. now i am looking for something that is less formal and complicated  but still with some sort of progression of different states. i ve been attracted to shinzen youngs practice since it seems very practical and an active community  but i am at this point very open and am searching for alternatives.   my main intention with meditating is to be as aware as possible in daily life.  which teachers and techniques would you recommend that has clear instructions  some sort of progression of meditation  an active community and ample resources online ,2021-09-29 03:08:56

73841,idk if it s from lockdown or what but i m having such a hard time coping with my depression. i used to have the strength to ignore impulses and thoughts but i m slowly taking backward steps into feeling depressed everyday like i used to. even random thoughts of relieving myself of life as if it s painful to go on another day. horrible to think but sometimes i just feel exhausted living as me. keeping up with everything. i understand how ungrateful this sounds and how i should just suck it up but they are things i know are just thoughts  just having a hard time remembering everything i taught myself.,2020-10-21 21:04:14
188087,i ve been dealing with phycosis and schizophrenia  the schizophrenia being suspected by my therapist and gp but not confirmed  since i can remember and going through traumatic experiences certainly didn t help my development.  i feel like  if i overcome one issue  my brain creates another. i can never find peace.  i get to a point where i feel happy and then it all goes to shit. i literally have no control over my life. i ve tried am trying everything and every day now i just feel awful. want to jump infront of a cat  off a building  slit my wrists. it s just unbearable..i m not looking for a answers from you guys i m just venting i guess. my religion i was raised in i ve lost because they were actually a cult. so i ve a hate for god  no offense to anyone who believes in god . i feel like i have no one. my family relationship is in tatters and idk if i ll ever be able to fix it.  it s just panick attacks and crying and hating myself and everything around me every day you know  i m good at hiding it. some ppl know i m not...doing the best but they have no idea how bad i really am.  whenever i try talk to someone it s just judgment or they say they can t handle it  even though i handle them when they re upset. i ve just been the underdog my whole life and yeah. been struggling more then i let on  just need  a hug from someone who understands but not gonna get that lol.  hope everyone here is well ,2021-12-01 14:10:11
3878,food drives are noble  and while it s a good thing that people feel a personal connection shopping for individual food items from a list for someone in need  and it makes them feel like they did something good for someone  they did    it s always better to give money instead of food to food pantries.  that  1 you donate can be leveraged with other cash donations to buy large quantities of food in bulk at discounted prices from supermarkets.   also  food pantries have limitted storage capacity and may have too much of some inventory or too little of others at times. cash donations help not only mitigate this issue  but also helps with ancillary costs like refrigeration  heat  overhead  etc.  food pantries are always short on fresh fruits and vegetables  due to difficulties accepting food donations directly because of storage capacity limitted shelf life. cash donations allow them to leverage scheduled bulk orders from local farmers and supermarkets.   non profits  hearts may be in the right place when they sponsor food drives and solicit people to shop for and donate food items  but cash goes so much farther helping people.   if you work with or are affiliated with a non profit that sponsors similar kinds of food drives  you should encourage them and those donating to donate cash instead of food  and donating directly to a food pantry instead of the non profit to maximize the return on investment to the people you re trying to help.,2021-06-14 04:55:40
193804,to disclaim  please always call your doctor and make sure you communicate with your doctor about any symptoms you experience on an antidepressant. antidepressants may be the route to go for some and therapy may be the route for others. both together can be beneficial too.  this is not a post to deter individuals from taking meds or seeking help.           i have been overwhelming numb at home since starting my meds. sometimes i m not sure if this emptiness is worse than my depression itself or not. granted  through the work day  i find it easier to distract myself and be happier in person. i just feel so  artificial at home. so tired. so quiet. i sleep so much some times or i want to sleep. i just feel pitifully hollow. i do not know if the feeling of this nothingness was worse than the highs and lows of my depression or not. i know i ve improved task and work wise. i just can t help this disjointed and disconnected from my personal relationships.,2021-12-23 22:41:24

122780,i m a 19  almost 20  year old woman who has been struggling with depression for years. it s been off and on  but it s affected me severely. it s taken so much away from me. i had hobbies  and i don t find them interesting anymore. i had a job and school at the time  so it wasn t a huge deal. i moved away from where i lived before and put my education on hold.   and then my job sucked what little happiness and joy i had in my life out of me. it was only in retail  but regardless  i was miserable. my husband and i talked about it and i have money saved so i ll be fine for a while. he said i should quit. i had a panic attack one day and called out  i haven t gone back since. i feel better. i told my manager i had a transportation issue and i wouldn t be able to come in for a while. so i might as well go ahead and step working there  since it won t be fixed for a while.   so. now i m stuck at home most of the time  and besides getting my house together  cleaning it  rearranging stuff  getting rid of stuff  i don t do much else. i scroll through my phone on social media  i watch netflix  hulu  youtube  etc. there is nothing else for me.  today i am going to force myself to get gas  go to hobby lobby or michaels and i m going to get some yarn and crochet hooks. maybe an adult coloring book  i don t really know. but mainly the yarn and crochet hooks. i ve watched a few tutorials and i have a feeling i ll like it and be able to get the hang of it.   i don t care if i get frustrated or discouraged  if it ends up being more difficult than i had anticipated. i am going to crochet until my fingers fall off.   i don t know if anyone else here has had to do the same thing  but i refuse to just live and not  do  anything. i have to make myself do something or i might lose my mind.,2021-04-16 10:47:24

176895,i ve spent the last 5 years struggling with severe depression. dropped out of school  moved back home  lost my job  lost my relationship  and eventually moved back in with the parents at 23 years old. all of this was because of being depressed and all the symptoms that come with it.  i am so numb  all the time. i m watching a lot of my peers hit giant milestones in their lives. graduating  getting married  buying a house  moving away  etc. and i m just  existing  barely. rotting in bed for over a year  frozen in time.  i m currently on my third mental health medical provider. i have tried pretty much every antidepressant or mood stabilizer there is to try for my circumstances. i literally have a microsoft excel sheet to keep track of what i ve tried because even my provider has forgotten what we ve already tried and has accidentally re prescribed things before.   i ve been in therapy for years. my therapist is my only outlet for conversation and venting now. i can t maintain relationships and friendships because of my condition.  if one more person tells me  it will get better  or  don t give up hope  i will explode.  i am a shell of a person with a brain plagued with severe medication resistant depression. i live in a pretty rural area so resources are scarce for adults with mental health issues. i don t even have access to a psychiatrist. i just finally was able to get in with an actual md after seeing two nurse practitioners for a few years who admittedly were in over their heads with my case.  i can t even cry anymore. i m just watching this disease taking away years of my life and nothing i ve tried has helped.,2021-10-24 04:14:44

2252,on january i started to do mediation using waking up app of sam harris.  i finished daily lessons in one month and had some benefits. quickly i learned how to calm my mind and how to focus on silence. but things changed when i learned that sam harris is an atheist. i stopped to use his technics and searched for other apps and methods. but with every next teaching i started to have questions which made me confused. i realized that different teachings have different answers for simple questions. what am i  does time really exist  is reincarnation real  are we living in a simulation  if there is only one true and meditation offers to bring us closer to truth  why different teachings have different answers  now i regret that i started this path. i was  a total capitalist and was very happy with my life. meditation took all my wish to live.,2021-05-28 15:22:12
55393,i never get peace of mind with these thoughts constantly around. every day is the same constantly laying down unable to do anything productive because pursuing any activity increases the risk of these thoughts coming back to torment me. every day im bombarded by unpleasant images and memories that are stuck in my head and keep repeating itself. i cant do anything whether its masturbating or listening to an audiobook or exercising working out or talking to anyone because thats when these intrusive thoughts tend to pop up and just ruin my mood. i cant fucking take it anymore. the cringe  the discomfort is really overwhelming that i just wanna kill myself to end my suffering. i cant do anything without the recurring thought or image of me doing something ridiculous  bizzare and cringeworthy... god  god fucking kill me already,2020-08-10 21:08:36

108084,i live in a house with five other people  yet i still feel so alone. the house is small  we can t  escape one another my family hates one another. the only thing i ever hear is the screams  screams at one another that make me want to cry. my family only interacts with one another to either scream  complain or ask for something. i cant remember the last time there hasn t been screaming between everyone  about how messy the house is  though no one will bother to clean it. my only solace from the constant screaming is my room that i share with my other siblings  my desk being the only thing that is clean in the house. but that still get contaminated by old water bottles and food wrappers that i didn t eat  or by the overwhelming noises of the screaming  the noises  the presence of everything that makes me want to cry. and i cant tell a single soul about it. i can not escape this  i have not left the house in weeks  my school is online  so i am stuck here. with the noise that never ends.   my parents talk behind my back about me  but just in earshot so i will hear every word that they say. i can not tell them about my anxieties  about how i feel  about anything i want to keep private  as it will not stay that way. i will hear things i confided to them being spoken on the phone or chatted about casually with others.  they are not bad people though  they are just stressed  my disabled sister is at home  and she will always scream for what she wants  and will never stop  no one sleeps  and that only makes the screaming worse. there is no escape from it.     i have friends  but they are all too busy to talk  with school  with work  with friends from school or actual life. i am scared to bother them with my problems with how lonely i am  as i know they are all annoyed by me  that they only really tolerate me. i know i am annoying  i am bad at social things  i try my best  but it is never good enough. if i were to die  they would be upset for a few days but would move on quickly  no one would really care. but i am too much of a coward to go through with it  even though others would probably better off without having to deal with me.    my only solace is my escapism  the writing i do being the only thing that distracts me from the world both locally and at large that is crumbling around us. but my writing is terrible  and the anxieties still drip into my thoughts no matter what i am doing. i can not escape. reality feels less real every day  i feel like i am floating through a dream. nothing is real  i can see my hand  but i can t really feel it. i smile i laugh  but i only watch behind my eyes  spending my nights letting my emotions out where no one can see. so no one will talk about it. i am just so alone and it hurts so much. i wish it could just end that i could just not be here anymore. that i could just not be. but i can not say anything to anyone  as i don t want to bother  i just smile  and pretend that i am perfectly alright as the screaming never stops.  i am sorry for this rant  it is something i had on my mind  i will probably end up deleting this later. i am sorry agian.,2021-02-09 00:23:54

119689,hi everyone  i d like some input on my thought process here and if i m making sense... i know it s long  but would appreciate it if there s someone out there that could take the time to read through this  especially if you have wellbutrin  or if you ve been living  drug free  and doing well .     alright  here it goes...  i was on zoloft 25mg for about 8 months back in 2018. zoloft is an ssri and directly effects the levels of serotonin in the brain. this past february  i started wellbutrin 100mg sr 1x per day  and this med is geared towards dopamine.      i didn t start wellbutrin because i was depressed  rather everything in life sort of felt  blah  to me. i was under the impression i was experiencing post ssri induced disassociation. when i started the wellbutrin  i must admit  a lot of feeling came back. i even went as far as resigning from my job only a week into taking the medication  and while that was something i was considering for a while  i am convinced the wellbutrin had   at least   something to do with it.     i m very sensitive to these drugs  so 100mg wellbutrin sr  taken once a day  was perfect for me.      but then i started experiencing some weird  dizziness like  symptoms. i d make spelling errors in my emails at work  have trouble  focusing   like  physically looking at something with my eyes   and just a general  wtf is happening... but i m cool with it  type of feeling... it s really hard to explain.      i took it 1x day for a month  all of feb   then started taking it every other day beginning in march. that seemed to do it for me  and all seemed to be going well.      then  i thought i was doing ok  but started getting paranoid about my libido sex life  not that i was exactly experiencing any adverse effects  the  itchiness  i would sometimes feel  the dry skin feeling  and the anxiety around thinking i was losing my hair faster than i would have been had i not been on the drug.      so i stopped completely  was basically tapering already . i didn t really have any side effects  but then a few days later i ate something like 7 000 calories in one sitting. i also remember being really  really tired on this day  so my body could ve just been craving the sugar  ate a lot of cherry pie . this was something like 3 4 days after my last dose  but i m also thinking that my drinking from the saturday prior had something to do with the binge... more on this alcohol below.     anyways  i woke up the next morning after that and my face was bloated. i felt like crap. then i shaved my beard two days after that   a beard i ve had for a long time  mind you. this was when things just started going sort of downhill.      it was sort of this  holy f  ck  rollercoaster that i m just now regaining balance from today  about a week or two later.      i m starting to think i should just stay on the damn drug for 3 4 months like my doctor has advised  but he admittedly isn t the best with the psychological side. he s more specialized in the heart  which is why he s our primary care doctor  my dad has a heart condition . the wellbutrin thing was actually my idea  of course he researched it before giving the greenlight   lots of people have success with wellbutrin after an ssri  myself included .      i just can t really decide if i should go back on it  or just wait it out. looking back  things were a bit better when on the drug  but being off of it has really given me a sense of control over my life that i felt i was lacking when on the drug. i ve made two really big realizations since being off wellbutrin  so it s reassuring to know that i can make really strong progress without the drug influencing my life. i m reconsidering my relationship with substances and alcohol  and i ve noticed my living space has been cleaner  on top of a few other things  although i ve noticed i ve been spending a lot more money  it s a bit more difficult to control urges to  say  buy a coffee or a nicotine vape  and i just can t tell if hair loss was a thing for me  but i don t know .      i just don t want to lose my hair. i don t want to mess myself up going off and on these drugs  granted  100mg is not a big dose at all  and my experience with 25mg zoloft wasn t  that  significant  either . i don t want to feel  out of touch  with my life. i don t want to be dizzy going into work and not really realize that i m dizzy  if that makes sense  lol .     on the other hand  i really feel that i ve regained a degree of control over my life since being sober from it. i still can t tell if my hair has been impacted  starting to see a reoccurring theme that i m subconsciously very concerned about the hair loss   i ve definitely gained a slight amount of weight  most noticeably in my face and abdomen   my skin is not as dry  i don t get itchy sensations around my body  i can bounce back from the fatigue quite nicely  but am usually only tired if i smoke weed that day   i ve realized that alcohol is negatively effecting my life  i ve taken an honest look at my way of life as whole... the list really goes on and on. the point is  i ve still managed a very positive life  and made really monumental positive change since being off of it.      this post is getting too long... so i ll cut it here. thanks to everyone who took the time to read this  any input is appreciated.     tl dr   considering going back on 100mg wellbutrin 1x every other day  like i was up until march 17th. it was a few days after that when things started getting weird  disassociation  weight gain  binged 7k calories one night  sort of a  whoa  type of feeling when you finally come out of it . that said  i m reflecting on the time i was on it  and realized that deciding to go off of it exposed a few weak points in my life  so am actually grateful for the experiences i had coming off of it. but  i m now considering going back on it. i also stopped largely because i didn t want to lose my hair  which is something i m now realizing might ve been nothing short of my anxiety coming into play  because 100mg is a very low dose for wellbutrin . overall  my experience with wellbutrin was good  and i really liked my physical appearance on it  however i ve made some really positive changes since coming off of it that i m thinking i want to ride out from a sober perspective. i m also considering going back on wellbutrin sans alcohol for two months and see if i can really get things going  because i was drinking while on wellbutrin. coming off of it has really made me realize my body doesn t tolerate alcohol well  and i shouldn t be drinking on these drugs to begin with  so i d like to potentially give sobriety  in combination with wellbutrin  a shot and see what happens. or  maybe i just go sober in general.      note    there s a lot going on here and i m sorry if it s confusing  hopefully it makes some sense. it s a lot to organize internally and convey appropriately. if anyone needs

183966,why am i depressed over this  in this day and age you see employees quitting over a shitty manager or being treated horribly by a boss. i m a gm and i had to fire an employee i admire  respect  and appreciated. he had a drug problem and did drugs at work  i fought for him but in the end the word came down from the top that he is to be terminated. damn this fucking corporate strong arm. he was one of my best employees  he needs support not abandonment  and i just feel my depression kicking in because again  what s the point of it all anyway. no one truly cares and i can t even show this kid some compassion because i m his boss firing him.,2021-11-16 18:09:19

118570,last night i left all of friends and they stopped but since im selfish i left them they i thought after leaving everything behind i would feel better but i still feel bad i left them but i cant forget about them i left them because before i was 19 i had no friends i lived by self well my parents were there but i did not talk them i was mostly alone and unhappy when i met them my lonliness started to get less but i also started to feel like a burden and im not used to being in relationship i wanted to alone again because thats who i was   but even after leaving them i still feel bad i mean i dont have that many good reasons for leaving them they are not people that hurt well im planning on leaving my parents because they are horrible to me i promised to them i wont hurt myself i guess i wont kill myself since im a coward   there is also no point in making this post maybe i was always meant to be unhappy for life since there are just some people just unfortunate in this maybe god created for met to suffer   if there is such a thing as a happy life i wish i could get that when im reborn,2021-03-29 23:12:23

157282,i cant stand being around happy and jumpy and enthusiastic people  i know that makes me seem like an asshole and it does make me feel like one but it s true. i just get so fucking overwhelmed when someone in close proximity to me has life in them and is bubbly. im so physically tired 24 7 and being around someone who is energized and always ready to start a new day makes me feel small and even more tired. my mom is like this and anytime im around her i feel like she s sucking away the minimal remains of spark i have in me and it makes me feel like a body without a person. again  this makes me feel like shit but i cant help it no matter how much i try.  i wish i was awake again,2021-08-13 23:05:51
170825,that s all i have to say. i don t really know what else there is. i feel like nobody is there for me  and i am always there for them. i am tired and sad all the time  but nobody knows it. to them  i m great at living. they even ask me how i do it  how i make everything look so easy. it s not easy. when they crumple  i am there for them. when i crumple  i am left behind. it s like they think it s not a big deal because it never happens. i m always doing okay. i m clearly not. but whatever. i literally have nobody left to even check on me  so at this point  it doesn t even matter. i m lucky that i love my dogs so much because they re the only thing keeping me here. all i want to do is crawl back into my shitty abusive relationship with my ex so that i can at least have some form of comfort  regardless of how fucked that is. i m just uncertain of everything now.,2021-10-01 23:05:38
26162,i am starting to feel like the only friends i have now are either using me or only acquainting with me because they know i m fragile. i truly feel like the only person i have right now is my dad.  i am someone who needs other people to talk to and vent to  and dad just doesn t understand mental illness. i feel like i m a burden on everyone and that i m annoying when i reach out for help.  my best friends recently told me that i am too much of a negative person that they don t want me in their lives anymore  and last friday i got dumped by the guy i was in love with.  i don t know what to do. i don t want to give up and leave my dad alone  but i also don t want to keep on suffering.  i m studying to become a nurse and i know that if i hold on  one day i can become someone that truly helps people  but i need help and loyalty now.  i m lost.,2020-04-29 20:24:23
4745,alright so i reconnected with an old friend recently  and obviously we have a past. she used to be such a compulsive liar  who manipulated people. so a few days ago she messaged me saying she s different now  and that she is just working on herself and working on being a good mom for her kids. i don t know if i should trust that she has changed or is changing or what. see i have a really good heart  and no matter how badly people treat me i always end up giving them another chance. it s super frustrating. anyways  what should i do ,2021-08-06 16:58:52
146773,i wake up feeling really down and proceed to go about my day feeling really depressed and not being able to do much. i curl up in the evenings and just lie on my bed feeling like complete crap over my body  how i ll never be the girl i want to be and then i ll spend half the night in tears not being able to sleep. i find this really takes a toll in my relationship with my boyfriend and this leads to more fights because i m distant or that i seem uninterested.  i really wish i could have a minute of peace  even doing activities rarely takes my mind off of all the dysphoria.,2021-07-07 21:45:06

142353,hello all  i have struggled with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder  clinical diagnosis  for close to 10 years now. i believe i am also bipolar  family history and symptoms match  and on the spectrum  every exam i take shows significant asd traits but no formal diagnosis yet . i don t really have any family left  my dad passed 6 years ago from a heart attack and my mom passed last year from stomach cancer. i had 1 brother that i was raised with but he is special needs and i am his poa. i have some awesome friends but none that take in a nother  dog.   i have an extremely nice puppy  just under a year old  the goal was never for me to own this dog. my ex and i got the dog together under the pretense she was going to be taking care of it and i would be financially responsible for it. she didn t have her id at time of adoption so i put my name down. we broke up and i have the dog. i love this dog  don t get me wrong and i ve tried to do the best by her. i have paid for obedience classes  get her groomed regularly  feed her daily  etc. but my depression gets so bad that leaving my apartment at times is insurmountable.  please don t judge me to harshly for this. i know it s bad but that s why i m here. sometimes i struggle to leave my apartment. leaving for work sometimes is really hard. i had to take a 3 month loa after my mom passed because i just couldn t get out of bed. i struggle to take my trash out  as i type i have 3 full bags in my apartment. as this relates to my dog  it means i haven t taken her outside to use the bathroom in probably weeks. i own a carpet cleaner and i clean everything up as soon as it happens but i really struggle with taking her out. she wasn t house trained when we got her so she doesn t tell me when she needs to go. it s very difficult to motivate myself to get on a schedule to take her out at a certain time of day so she just goes randomly in the apartment.   i love her and want to provide for her but i m worried my depression stops me from being able to care for her adequately. i m currently not in therapy because i can t do virtual appointments but now that i m vaccinated i hope i can start going back. i m just really struggling to objectively view my situation. am i capable to take care of a dog  there is a huge stigma surrounding surrendering a dog   i don t want to do it  but is it something i should do  even if i get back into therapy is it right of me to keep the dog not knowing how long this will continue before i get better  is there foster options to care for the dog while i receive the care i need  i just don t know these answers and i m so afraid of the judgement of others to even ask them.   please be my objective eyes in this situation. what are my options  what is the most ethical thing for me to do in this situation  i don t want my dog to live this way but if she continues to live with me it will be this way until i can get better.,2021-06-22 05:14:20
18896,but then i turned into an anxious and slightly paranoid wreck from weed and alcohol abuse. now i m 31 and find it really hard to maintain online friendships. i was always bad at making friends irl  so i turned to the online world  but now i suck at that too. i miss playing counter strike and cod with my old online buddies. now i m just stuck at home due to severe anxiety and a medical condition  playing games alone. such fun  s,2020-04-03 00:32:38
6142,has anyone been in an intensive outpatient program and did it help you  i was hospitalized a few months ago for attempting to end my life. my doctor wanted me to transition to an iop  but i was anxious to get back to work and not dip into any more of my sick leave. in the last week or so i ve really started spiraling and worry i ll either end up dead or back inpatient. so  i m wondering what your experience in an iop was like and would you recommend it  i figure it could be a good middle ground. thanks.,2020-02-19 21:35:01
16964,i ve noticed that now that i feel depressed and recognized that that s what s going on everyone wants to help fix it . it s annoying  i ve been sent two self help books i don t have the attention span to get through a book  and a bunch of links to videos and websites. i know it s out of love but i m not ready for it  i find all of this overwhelming and it s not helpful. is that normal  is it normal to feel annoyed at the people who want to help you  i m not asking anyone for help right now and they automatically reach for the fixit tool.,2020-03-27 01:06:50

3747,if you are like me you browse through a ton of news and publication websites on your phone daily you have probably seen a paywall. a paywall blocks you from reading the full article  usually with a pop up and that blurs the background stating you must subscribe.  i cannot justify paying a handful of subscriptions per year for what sometimes is a single news article or so a month if that from a website.  if you use chrome on your android  and i m sure it s similar to apple phones i m not sure  most paywall sites use javascript to put up a paywall. a simple way around this is.  1. click the three dots in the corner of your browser 2. click  settings  3. scroll then click  site settings  4. scroll then click  javascript  5. there will be a part that says blocked  click  add site exception  6. write for example  www.nytimes.com  7. click  ok   now you can freely browse the articles on that website without a paywall coming up.  enjoy,2021-06-10 21:49:13

11124,i ve been paid the incorrect amount for three times in two months now.  today i emailed them about the last mistake  and they called back saying    gt   there s nothing we can do. what s on the contract was a mistake.   me   but i legally signed a contract saying i d get x   n  and i didn t get n.    gt them   i don t know what to tell you.   me   it s okay. just email me with that information. i ll take care of it.     long silence   gt them   i m afraid it is what it is.   me   doesn t matter. send me what you said on the phone by email.   them   okay    awkwardness    bye.   about one hour later they called back     gt  okay so we ve managed to get the bonus as stated on the contract and you ll get paid next week.   me   thank you very much.    gt them   happy new year  etc.   me   you too  enjoy.        sometimes it pays off to enjoy  chess  https   lichess.org . stand up for yourself. what they are doing is a reverse    office space  https   www.rottentomatoes.com m office space   scheme   it works because probably thousands of people don t care or are too tired to do anything about being paid a small amount less. however  it s not that trivial as it seems because n   thousands of people can be a lot of profit.      the pitchforks are coming to eat the rich.,2021-12-30 18:45:21

112811,so my emotions are heavily suppressed to the point i don t even recognize them anymore  but i can still tell that there are emotions underneath it all from the physical effects and mental effects. whenever i see a knife i think about killing myself  but due to the suppression i have no urge to act on it along with the rest of my emotions. there is also an ever present weight on my mind which i can t quite figure out which emotion it would belong to as its description fits quite a few  but i think i may be depressed under it all. my sister was recently diagnosed with adhd and both my father and i are the next most likely in the family to have it as well as some speculation that my father has several other mental issues that haven t been diagnosed. recently i think the rest of my family has been catching on that things aren t quite alright on my end and i am just wondering if you guys think i should seek out help from a professional. one of the reasons i have been putting it off is because my father is absolutely unreliable  when i have tested the waters with him results were spectacularly horrendous. in a conversation it went from  your grades are slipping   people are struggling during the pandemic   do you know anyone struggling   and as stated before he may have several underlying issues. my mother on the other hand is much more reliable but also much more overloaded especially at the moment  since i feel no sense of urgency to the situation i have not wanted to add to her worries. the person i have confided the most in is the aforementioned sister who i have only told a little of this mess but from what i have been gathering she has been pressuring my parents about it. i was just wondering what you guys think i should do.   thank you for reading this and thank you again if you have an opinion you shared with me.   edit  i should say the emotional suppression has been going on for about 6 years and the suicidal thoughts for 2 3.,2021-02-24 01:43:51
36855,so  thanks to a shitty issue with my pharmacy psychiatrist  not sure who is too blame  they both pointed fingers at the other  i had to go without some of my meds for 10 days.   and it was hell. i had withdrawal sickness from hell.  i m back on them now  but my mental health is still not happy about having to go cold turkey.   i m giving myself self love  and not expecting too much from myself  but i really want to get back into working out.    i have a membership at a gym and i go to kickboxing classes normally  my gym is being smart  half class sizes and for gym equipment  every other machine or area is blocked off.    but as much as i want to go  i still physically feel exhausted and not the best. the idea of attending a class right now makes me shutter.   does anyone have a link or a recommendation or a routine for a way i can get a decent workout at my gym even though i m feeling blue    basically i just want something simple. it can be intense  but simple. 50 bicep curls  followed by 100 sit ups  and a mile run  sure.   any routine involving me getting a bunch of equipment out...not today. i love those  but not today.,2020-06-05 12:27:44

155028,i hate hate hate hate myself so much for being shy. i have such a hard time with conversation and i hate talking to people. i learned that no one really cares about what i have to say so i m just quiet most of them time. what gets me is that people get on to me for being shy and then they ignore me when i talk. i fucking hate myself so much for being shy. i wish i was aloud extroverted person. it s better to be an extrovert overall. it feels like i won t accomplish anything life being shy. fuck i hate myself so much.,2021-08-06 03:12:25
1356,hi   since i ve started meditation  the greatest difficulty and pain in the ass has always been the posture. there is always some stiffness in the neck when i lean into a chair or a pillow  even if sometimes it lessens by focusing on breathing  it comes back witj a vengeance. i often want to quit just because of that  wondering if it even makes any sense to continue doing it if i can t even the basic  the posture right.   amp  x200b    but i can t find the classical meditation cushion anywhere  i don t live in a developed or asian country and meditation isn t a common activity here  what can i use instead of it     amp  x200b   thank you in advance.,2021-04-19 18:03:56
7906,opened up in therapy about something i didn t deem important and rather silly  but kept thinking i didn t want to divulge at any point  with no real reason behind not wanting to . i couldn t have guessed in a million years that it was the root of my 9 years symptomatic bulimia. we hadn t even dealt with it yet  but a few days went by before i realized i wasn t having any bulimic urges. sometimes things don t necessarily add up logically when trying to remember the source of issues. the best sessions to me  are always the ones where i talk about what i don t want to talk about.,2021-10-02 17:57:34
67384,hi everyone. let me put everything straight forward  market promoted books on depression  self steem and things like that don t satisfy me. i m not saying that i m deeper than other people or know more about human s thought more because of reading some freud and spending lots of time thinking about the compexity of human process of thought  i m just not satisfied. what these books say  they just seem so stupid to me. i m not an arrogant person  this is a real problem for me  i can t find any appropriate help  book  anything. i can t talk even to my dearest ones  because once they start talking i feel deeply mentaly harassed because i realize they don t have a faint idea of what i m suffering from  despite all that explanations i gave to them before.   i can t emphasize enough on this  i don t think i m special  i don t think that freud himself should come down to earth from his elevated position in paradise and treat me  but regular treatments don t work for me. i m an undergrad student in one of the most prestigious universities in my country among lots of talented and skilled students  while i m not able to approach lots of my homework problems. i feel stupid. it s not because of i constantly compare myself to other people  i don t. it s because the only joyful expriences of mine  were those that make me feel the moment when you percieve something not really easy  when you figure out how to approach an abstract problem  and being unable to reach such joy for not a short time  impose such a heavy bear on my mind  that sometimes make me even suicidal. the deteriorating economical situation of my country makes it very hard to have a joyful break and go to a journey to get fresh  or see a therapist  if we take it as a presupposition that there is any sophisticated therapist  regularly. also my family is a traditional one  they don t believe in therapy and such things at all.    i m under a wild pressure. i don t think that i will be able to find a job. i used to be a good student in high school but now i can t solve problems  i usually can t prove things  i m studing mathematics   and i feel like i m dumb  biologically. i see my parents everyday  they are stupid  intransigent  and don t underestand even the most obvious lies that the dictatorship governing my country always regurgitate. and this  make me feel that i m geneticly incapable of being a mathematician and consequently  having joyful mind related expriences. i feel that i m inextricably linked with my background  with my parents  and i will never be able to run away from my roots.    i want help. i feel i m done. i feel buried  and future seems a bleak lie from here. please give me a name of a book. or a way i can systematically think in. or a new perspective from which i can see a future for myself. i m not bad in fields like philosophy and even i have seen some strands of talent in art in myself  but mathematics is the only thing that make me feel stunned  and always leave me in a slight tongue tied happiness.   sorry for any mistake in my words  sentence  or language structures. i read a lot in english but it was my first time that i wrote something.,2020-09-26 11:40:00
7490,reminder  a good physique isnt built in 3 months. you need dedication and time. so  if you want to see some results in the next summer  start hitting the gym right now   you dont need an exact workout plan or expensive supplements to start your journey. just work with what you have. your first goal should be  that you try to make hitting the gym or the place where you work out a habit. if you achieve this  you will see the results.  start getting in contact and with your friends and form groups. that way you will have more fun working out and it will be a social event  so win win.  i know youre gonna rock this. see y all at the gym ,2021-09-21 09:36:57
6088,i was pondering how to go about remembering that which has been forgotten  and reaching perfect understanding  and this message came to me     she knows what you want  but you have to let go for her to give it to you  because she can t touch what you are holding onto   it reminds me exactly of the rules to a boardgame i recently created  which came to me as fast as i could write it down in a meditation a couple months ago.  the animus in the game has a zone of  protection  around him which prevents the anima and the  other  from controlling pieces in that zone.  i closed my eyes and repeated in my mind over and over  let go  let go  let go...  and the very instant i opened my eyes i was presented with something i had been seeking all night.  our power here is to solidify what is.  when we relenquish our grip  the other can change it for us to what we are seeking.  trust the universe and let go.  i ve done it before  and it works every time  but sometimes we need to see it a few more times to really let it set in.  we aren t controlling what changes here  we are controlling what does not change.  our other half  and the third entity control what changes.  all three are fundamentally us  but while we are in here  this is how it appears to work.,2022-01-10 00:59:13

20337,i thought i would be able to handle it better  since i don t go out much anyway. but ever since the lockdown has started  it s been getting more and more difficult to do anything. i ve also been getting more anxious. i feel like just..cleaning up the room i m stuck in  but i can t get myself to do that. it just stresses me out even more thinking about it.,2020-04-08 07:00:11
127729,i m going crazy. i don t know what i am doing with my life and why i m doing it. or better  why i m not doing anything. i hate time. i see people changing in front of me  striving to get better and eventually reaching their goals  leaving me behind. i graduated high school last year  and spent one whole year doing almost nothing  after being rejected at the last exam for joining my country s navy at the officers school. and now i m trying again. meanwhile i see all my friends in university  having fun and going ahead. and i m here. doing nothing.  i would really like to join the officers school but i feel like i don t deserve that. but again  i m already one year behind with no backup plan  and my parents spent a lot of money  books  train and plane tickets to get to examination site  to help me i have no right to say or do anything. i recently tried to contact one old friend of mine  just to find out  from a common friend  that she is now studying in another city  following her passion. and i m happy for her but i m also really sad bwcause i wanted to see her and talk with her and tell her i missed her. and yes i know i m being egoistic  i hate it and i hate myself for being like this. i would like to go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist or whatever  but i already passed it  during ine of the navy examination phases  by lying and by knowing what they wanted to hear. and also because once i m doing something i need to be successful and couldn t be rejected there. but i feel like if i went to one i won t be able to join the navy anymore because i d be diagnosed with something. also i have an high iq and a friend said that probably that s the reason i could fake it all so easily and avoid the psychiatric tests. but i hate it. i just want to be loved  probably. probably i am just love deprived or just sad or whatever i don t know. i just want to be happy and loved back.  sorry for making you read all of this  have a nice day.,2021-05-02 16:09:08
46710,for a little context  i m a college student from korea. my parents live in japan because of my dad s job.   my mom called me crying a couple days ago.  apparently my dad has been struggling a lot with depression recently and he told her that he thought that maybe it d be better if he just died.   he s worked at the same company for 30 years now  and he said he feels as though there is nothing to show for it. he s a c level manager at a relatively big company  and i think he s accomplished more than enough  he started out as an accountant . he s provided for me and my sister and i haven t had to worry about money or college tuition  etc. my mom told him these things and that we re all really grateful for what he s done and he has no need to feel that way.   i know he really wanted to get to the ceo position and that last year he was robbed of what was basically his final chance to get there. i also know he s made some bad investment decisions recently that he has a lot of regrets about.   he also hasn t been getting much sleep either. for about 2 months now he s been getting little to no sleep because what i mentioned earlier was bothering him. he s taking sleeping pills to go to bed now.   and now i just heard this morning that my grandmother  dad s mom  was diagnosed with alzheimer and had to be moved into a elderly home.   i honestly don t know what to do  and it doesn t help that i can t travel there to see him because of covid 19. i m worried about him.   i guess i just needed a place to vent and get some advice. i ve been keeping this all to my self for a while and it hasn t been exactly healthy for my mental state either.,2020-07-09 11:43:00
6474,for me meditation is letting thoughts come and go and hopefully being able to notice them as they do. but i have been wondering about the question above for a few  hours now. like they say be the alpha male  be in charge  but by being that are we producing alpha waves in our brain ,2022-01-31 12:35:28
9339,hi there    broke uni student here. found a grocery delivery app that gives ridiculous discounts to new customers. i used to get  1 sims from my local supermarket and sign up with a new phone number any time i wanted to use the discount  but the cheapest sims they have now is  10.   would anyone know of any cheap way to get sims  ideally european for shipping convenience  or online mobile numbers able to receive text messages  i can allocate about  2  3  2.5 per number.  i kindly thank you   ,2021-11-10 15:50:37
7778,i m not necessarily just talking about how any one of us might  get hit by a bus  one day  or suffer a life changing event very suddenly. i m more talking about the realisation that life is finite and because the time we all have left constantly decreases  it means there will come a point when there is not enough time to do things you enjoyed again even if finances would permit it.,2021-09-28 18:04:54
61531,i honestly think that people won t believe me if tell them how incredibly broken i feel most of the time  i have been pretending to be  normal  so long that i m scared that nobody will believe me.  the last few years the only thing that keep me going are my cats because i know that if something happened to me they would end up in a shelter or worse.  right now the covid is making it even gorse for me because i m high risk person and when i try to follow all the rules people think i m just paranoid  at work  they don t let me work from home  if i tell the to keep the distance  i m the only one wearing a mask there  and don t touch anything in my desk they get ofended.  i m already having nightmares thinking how i m going to avoid christmas without getting all my family  mad at me.  i used to love being at home just watching netflix but now i don t even get confort on that  most of the time i just law down watching asmr and cuddling my cats.  it s getting harder to pretend that i m fine and i m scare that if i explode nothing good is going to came out of it.,2020-09-03 05:49:07
2284,voice becomes influential when struggling turns successful    world will credit you for the entire journey of your struggle but only when you will walk up to the pinnacle. a point from where none can overlook you.  the same voice that went unheard by almost everyone becomes the voice for millions. it s all about  practicing your work till it turns magnificent.  noone will come to see when you are beginning to paint your masterpiece but each one will buy after it s done.  you got to have an immense belief on your voice to walk till the world not only believes it  but go crazy to hear it.,2021-05-03 20:02:51
59018,i m miserably unhappy with my job. it s not a career  it s just a job. changing jobs won t change a thing. i don t have the skills or education to do anything other than what i ve already been doing  working in factories  warehouses  and department stores. the only real change would come in making less  losing out on the vacation time and seniority that i ve built up  and having to deal with the consequences if the loan i took out from my 401k doesn t roll over to my next employer. given the fact that i ve always felt like i just don t have the mentality to survive in such blue collar jobs  i don t think i ll be happy anywhere i go.  it s gotten to the point that almost every day is full of casual racism and bigotry from my coworkers. most of whom are trumpsters  who can t shut up about how bad liberals are. i have to hear jokes about driving cars into blm protestors. i hear comments about how lesbians are trying to create a society where men are no longer needed. i hear how   the blacks are outbreeding the whites.  i hear people say they wish they were jewish  so they could just cry  discrimination  whenever they don t get their way. i hear so many bullshit attacks on joe biden that can easily also be thrown right back at trump  but these fucking sheep don t see it. i can t really talk about who i am or what i feel  because i m definitely not going to find a sympathetic ear. i m an atheist and someone  who doesn t know this  once said that atheists have no morals. it s a very small work environment  so there is no way of making any complaints without giving myself away.  i have no idea what i want to do with my life  so i have no paths towards anything better. i was lucky enough to get into the facility i m in now  seen as a year ago i was in a factory setting that was way too hot and working 50 60 hours a week.  that sudden drop down to only 40 hours has made it clear how poorly i am doing for financially. i m trying to keep on top of my debts  but i ve been living paycheck to paycheck for awhile now and i m once again unsure if i ll be able to pay my rent and not be broke. spoiler  i m probably not. i rarely have more than  100 in the bank. it s my own fucking fault  but i have no idea how i can make any changes. i have no life as it is  so i m not sure how much else i can sacrifice before i have nothing to do other than work and sleep.  i have no social life  no close friends  not a single best friend that i can trust. i m kinda close to my family  but it s just not enough. there are too many strained relationships. too much anger and bitterness over the past. to be honest  i often find myself emotionally drained after most interactions with my relatives and often find myself keeping them at a distance. there are some incredibly toxic elements to some of the relationships that make it not worth the time. i honestly just would rather be an orphan.  i won t waste time pissing and moaning about the state of the world  everything sucks. i can t find a single thing to be hopeful about. nothing gives me the sense that things will ever improve and i m tired of being told i worry too much. i m not looking forward to anything meaningful. i m more excited about an upcoming movie or tv show than i am about anything substantial. i have nothing of value that i hold dear.  i seriously doubt i ll ever date again. i can t meet anyone if my life depended on it. i m clearly too fucking pathetic to be of any value to anyone else. i hate myself. i have no confidence. i feel so damn inadequate that i can t stand being around people. i just want to be alone. it s not worth it. i have failed at making any relationship last and i just have the stink of desperation and loneliness all over me. nothing i ve said or done has attracted anyone.   ultimately  i just can t find a single fucking thing to be happy about. nothing that lasts. no words have ever changed my mind. everything feels hopeless. i am exhausted at this point and i can t convince myself that any of this  any of it  is worth another fucking year of the same shit. that s really all there is to say. i could find out i m sick and that i have less than a month left and i d be happy to hear it. i really don t know what all these people who find fault with my worldview are on. i just can t lie to myself like that. i can t pretend hard enough to feel like it isn t all just a waste of time. everything is bullshit.,2020-08-24 16:48:05
13481,even when i know i m right about something  no one listens  they brush me off. it just feels like everyone thinks i m an idiot that can t possibly be right about something.   it s frustrating because i just want to feel heard by people in my life without feeling like everything i do or say is going to be brushed off or that i m going to say something the wrong way. i just want to isolate myself for a little while  just to get a chance to recharge and not feel like i m embarrassing myself 24 7  but that isn t an option and it sucks.,2020-03-13 10:12:38
130,                                hello there   how is everyone   i hope you are all doing well    and i hope that you are enjoying your day     so i am here today to meet and make some new friends with who i can have fun with   so here a list of stuff about me   i talk on snap and discord    1. i am really nerdy  like very nerdy  dc over marvel comics and heroes wise   jurassic park is my favourite movie off al time  i also love dinosaurs.i know a lot of random nerd facts about anything tbh  examples such as  star wars  jurassic park  comic facts etc   2. i game on pc  xbox series x and playstation  i would be up for gaming together   3. i love warhammer 40k  my faction is the imperium  and fav space marine chapter are the imperial fists   4. i love memes  i have a lot and i am willing to share and have meme battles   5. i am huge history nerd  love vikiing history   6. i am a extremely caring person and i can get anxious a lot   7. i m norse pagan  8. anime uwu   no one aged 17 and under     so that s it   i will tell you more if you ask   thanks for reading hope to hear from someone soon   ,2021-02-10 19:53:29
3343,hey i m ady i m 25 from nevada looking for new friends.  i like to cook play video games and chill with my bf and cata. i m just bored and tired of all the fake ass people in my city. i m also an introvert so making friends is hard sometimes but i m trying to open up more but people tend to only reply a few times or try to hit on me so plz don t do either of those things.    also i smoke weed if you dont like that dont message me i m sick of people telling me i m a drug addict cuz i smoke weed,2021-06-24 14:25:32
1463,sitting  facing wall  eyes open pointed downwards  and no object which is the soto zen approach of  shikantaza   just sitting   hard to explain why but it feels like a better fit. i tend to overthink and that extends into overthinking  insight   even though both probably lead to the same thing at the end but simply a different approach  intro level meditations may start the same  as both may be introduced to beginners to focus on breathing.   i have only went to one soto zen introductory class and taken nothing formally on vipassana. i just did guided meditations and listening to monks for a theravada based approach to mindfulness for a while before gaining a fascination for zen  so i am no expert on either.,2021-04-24 10:16:09
89149,my therapist gave me the task of participating in support groups  so here i am.  so my question is why should i suffer living life if it doesn t matter in the end  when people say that they don t see any reason for living  people respond by saying something like  well  why not  you re here anyway so why not just experience life   this might just be my depression talking  but to me  experiencing life sounds kind of awful. it feels like life is just full of suffering in order to live. like working for the rest of your life in order to not be homeless. but why  it s kind of fucked up  but i would rather just get life over with now than to prolong the inevitable  and not suffer along the way. it sounds a little pathetic  but the idea of working itself just makes me not want to live. i would like there to be an afterlife where i get to remember the good times i had despite the suffering  but logically i just can t believe this. i believe it will be eternal nothingness forever. i believe the purpose of life is to just breed and then die. but then again  i don t have all the answers. no one knows what happens after we die. and maybe i just haven t experienced life enough and gained enough knowledge to come to the conclusion that life is actually a good thing.  it s nice putting my thoughts into words. i would like to read other people s thoughts  and maybe some support. thanks ,2020-12-11 00:45:40
150993,while most of the world is moving on from covid  half of my country is in lockdown. once i found out that my state was going into lockdown  i cheered. my job causes my depression which in turn makes me almost unable to lead a happy  productive life     i haven t slept well for 3 years  since i started this job    would suffer from on and off insomnia   no energy to enjoy my hobbies   i would spend most of my post work time in bed watching youtube and napping   it took me 2 years to actually start working out  had a gym membership for almost 3 years before i went consistently    the reason i haven t even started university yet is purely because i m burnt out after work and can rarely muster up the energy to play a video game  let alone study  so basically i haven t studied properly at all to get into university for 3 years    i felt angry  depressed  anxious and almost inhuman everyday  ever since lockdown started  i ve woken up with a smile on my face  my depression is entirely gone  i finally have motivation to do productive things and most of all  i feel human again. i feel like i m almost being gaslighted when i see how many people view lockdown as a terrible thing.  i m honestly hoping our lockdown gets extended because i simply do not want to go back to work  the reason i m depressed in the first place.,2021-07-22 21:07:24
11863,i ve had a semi long life  57 years  of serial passions. i believe having passions is the key to having a happy life. for untold people  having a passion aid building expertise and or skill at that passion is also a pathway to professional success.  i give a speech once a year to the business school at my alma matter about thriving at life. out of tens of thousands of graduates. i emphasize this   learn to develop passions and then go full blast at your passion s .,2022-01-18 01:12:39
168256,i don t know that i have depression  i do however feel a general sense of inadequacy in my life. i m 26  i separated from the military a few months ago and decided to go to a trade school on the gi bill for the job i did in the military  welding  just to add some legitimacy to my resume and maybe fill any gaps in my training  capabilities. i left the military because i wasn t happy there. i was an nco and traveled a lot but i had no real life or sense of value. i decided to fully commit to leaving after a cheating gf and a crappy deployment. they weren t what caused me to quit but they sealed the deal. after getting out i moved in with my parents because i m in debt and need a place to stay and unfortunately the gi bill and a part time job just won t cut it given the cost of living nowadays. my life since college has started has turned into a grind. i was hoping to meet people in my age range at school or at my part time job but i m surrounded by high school kids. i live in a small town and have a couple friends i still enjoy seeing but don t spend much time with them. the whole gf idea gets brought up a lot by my friends and family to which i usually explain that i m just not built for a relationship. the reality is i don t have anyone to meet and if i did have anyone to meet i don t have many redeeming qualities. i kinda just feel all alone in this earth  when i don t feel alone i feel looked down on. things are just tuff right now and i know they will get better. i m just venting because i need to vent to stranger on the internet.,2021-09-22 17:03:25
648,maybe there will be a day when i will feel better. maybe. but if what i feel now isn t worth going through to   maybe   achieve that point  then offing myself is a sensible decision.    i don t care if i hurt other people  mostly because i never had any friend and there is no love between me and the rest of the family. they already hate me enough for losing my appartment and moving back in their place  they ll be okay with me leaving one way or another.  therapy hasn t helped in over a decade  meds haven t helped  electrotherapy hasn t helped  exercise and volunteering  not every volunteer makes a difference  haven t helped either. socializing and trying to make friends  let alone trying to have a girlfriend  are so out of my reach that the effort just isn t worth it.   telling a vulnerable person to commit suicide is a horrendous thing to do  mostly because i don t know the people at the other side of the screen. but let s face it. sometimes  it is for the best. sometimes  it is a good solution.  i hate myself  care about nothing  i simply want to stop existing.  it s a permanent solution   that is the entire point. every time i see such a post i see  keep trying . sure  that is totally a sensible advice for someone that just started therapy. for someone that has been at it for years or decades  you re better off saying nothing. you think i haven t thought about it  ending your own life is the biggest decision you can make  of course i thought about going on  and i decided against it. only i can decide if it s right or wrong to end a life that is mine  just as i can t decide that for someone else. physician assisted suicide is getting more accepted for terminal illnesses or when the person is considered in too much pain. my position isn t any different.,2020-02-03 09:48:40
12103,if you have a job that requires frequent regular password changes  always change it on a monday. if you change it on a friday you re more likely to forget what you changed it to come monday after the weekend has passed.   changing it on monday will require you to use it for 5 consecutive days before the weekend  leading to better memory retention.,2022-01-25 08:35:13

5769,someone will test me on it  but there s no secret knowledge that you have and your kid shouldn t  baring i suppose traumatizing or wild situations because we can continue to white lie to our kids about actual terrors   as classic as   you were in my uterus   instead of  you were in my belly    or finding a real way to explain sex within kid boundaries.   to as random as giving a real explanation to  what s that  whats mommy doing   when a toddler asks instead of blowing them off.   sure they might not fully understand but you validated their desire to come to you for knowledge which creates trust  expanded vocabulary  and potentially grew their perspective or introduced them to something interesting.,2021-08-03 23:28:54
136778,idk if this is depression or something more  bc there are other symptoms unusual for clinical depression alone  but  i just can t feel any positive emotions. it s just a constant flatline of nothing. that is  until i get hit with random anxiety  self hatred  or suicidal thoughts.   the only thing that makes me feel  stable  is music. if i just sit and listen to music  i can feel okay. but  nothing else helps. nothing i used to like gives me pleasure anymore. i know that should be obvious but  i ve never had it this severely. even if i didn t play my piano  i d at least enjoy seeing others do it. but  no. not even that helps anymore.  i ve accidentally gotten addicted to more unhealthy things in the past in an attempt to have an emotional failsafe to fall back on. drugs  porn  etc. these have been working less and less until they finally just stopped doing anything.  i feel empty. just a shell of a human being. what s the point in life if you can t give a genuine smile every now and then    i feel like this is causing me to become more and more reckless. i m so apathetic of everything that i m doing anything to try to feel something. i m afraid i might do something i ll regret but  on a much larger scale  i just don t give a fuck. i literally can t bring myself to care.,2021-06-02 00:56:20
153121,idk how to deal with this. it s obviously shitty thinking.  i got committed involuntarily for a suicide attempt and after the initial shock wore off  i went to groups with other people in the unit  heard some of their stories about why they were there and all that  and found myself realizing i don t have it as bad. i just noticed my depression easing up hearing about people who have it worse than me instead of feeling empathy sympathy.  like it wasn t bad enough that i m depressed with a suicide attempt on record but now my brain is just being a fucking asshole.,2021-07-30 17:45:47
154660,my whole life i have felt like a burden.    my narcissist mother damaged us kids beyond repair.    my life is great.  i have a spouse who loves me.  i have two kids that i connect with and love with all my heart.  i have not messed up my kids like my mother and father did.    i hate myself.    i have been selling things  donating things and throwing away things.  my goal is to get to where the only personal possessions i have are things i use weekly or more.    i ve shed any reminders of my past.  photos  band stuff  mementos and gifts.  all gone.   six years ago my spouse said  i wouldn t be happy anywhere   my spouse is right.    i m not going to harm myself.  i m just tired.  i don t want to be a burden.  the cleaning helps escape the memories.,2021-08-04 22:06:06

52890,i honestly feel very wrong to use the term   i am depressed  because i know it s thrown around lightly especially on social media and i don t want to invalidate the experiences of people who are actually struggling from depression. i think i have it but i was never formally diagnosed because my parents  country  and culture have a strong negative stigma towards it.   i moved back to my home country with my parents after the covid hit. i feel unproductive  on the verge of tears  always fighting about something in mind. i get stressed endlessly and wants to hide in my room. i ve been trying to be more productive but it is just so hard because every time i try  i remember i am not as productive as i was before even if i try my best. i used to not waste a single minute of my life. i would wake up  study  go to the gym  eat healthy  socialize  and maintain that straight as in university. but now i can t barely wake up  barely stay awake  do anything. if my parents criticize me for anything  even something small  like oh go put on a jacket it s cold or you re being a little loud  or whatever  i just want to cry. i was never this sensitive.   i m starting to push everyone away. a lot of friends live in a different country so it has been difficult to remain connected because of timezone difference. i recently found out i won t be seeing them for a while because the school decided to shut down for another semester. that just entirely wiped my any motivation of me to be snap them back  check up on them  just anything. i feel like i ve been a horrible friend right now.   i can t pull myself to do anything. i will sometimes feel the burst of motivation to clean  study  or whatever but it s gone in 3 min after i begin. i feel horrible  and even wrong for using the term depression because i am probably just lazy. but it s just so hard for me to look me in the mirror because i used to be so productive and awesome. i am generally proud of who i was before i moved back with my parents due to covid  and now i m so far away from her that im beginning to think she  my old self  didn t even exist.   i honestly don t know what i am looking for. i just needed to write it since i can t talk about this with my family or friends. maybe give me a pep talk  tell me to get my shit together  give me an advice if you ve been in my shoes  i don t know anything i just want to feel heard. thanks for reading if you made it this far. i know it was long and kind of pointless rambling.,2020-08-01 10:33:43
64706,when i get really depressed i just go on a binge of ordering tacos  specifically tacos  and eating until my stomach hurts. it sucks because i ubereats it every time and spend around 20  each time. i ve overdrawn my account 5 times in the past week but i just can t stop. moving on to my credit cards now.,2020-09-15 11:54:54
45766,so lately i ve been thinking about seeking treatment since i m slowly descending into darker spheres than usual. one of the scariest things that keep me from seeking treatment is how i m going to pause my daily life in order to gather the energy to open up to a medical professional and to do the necessary visits and therapy sessions or just to get a diagnosis and some meds. it just feels like there is this vast canyon i have to bridge in order to get help. currently the only thing i can imagine that can initiate the process of treatment is a full blown breakdown but i don t want to wait for that to happen and i can imagine that this isn t the healthy way of starting things.  any ideas and stories are welcome.,2020-07-06 07:41:02

33891,for the past year or so i have really been struggling with depression. i don t know why. but i think i found a main part of it.   amp  x200b   recently i have been really irritable and mad. i didn t really know why. i also haven t cried in months until now. i initially thought it was because i had blocked my emotions so much i just didn t show them. but now i think its because i didn t know what to cry about. i have realized that throughout my whole life i haven t really felt loved. or maybe just in the past couple of years i haven t.  i have 4 siblings. the one closest in age to me is 6 years older than me. this means i basically grew up an only child. i didn t play with my siblings very often. i was home schooled growing up so i didn t have many kids to play with. i wasn t allowed to play with the kids in my neighborhood. because of this i feel like i have been neglected.  it is very hard to explain my mom. me and my siblings have tried to figure out what is wrong with her. we have a hard time telling if she was abusive in any way. but i think i have figured it out.  i have felt like i have never truly been loved by her. or really anyone. she never did anything fun with me like my dad did. we never went to games. or went on bike rides or really anything. because of this the only things i have done with her ended up not being very fun.  it sounds really fucking stupid.  boohoo. mommy won t to fun things with me   but i feel like i haven t had many people who love me. of course shes said she does. but actions speak louder than words.  a lot of the things i have been doing lately are all things that make me happier. if i don t want to do something i won t until i am  emotionally stable.  but what i think my problem is  is that i don t feel loved. and if i don t feel loved by anyone i m gonna fucking love myself  if i m having a bad time and there is no one to support me. i m gonna support myself. and by support myself i mean play video games to numb the pain but besides that. i have identified the problem and will work towards fixing it.  next school year i think i will get in a public school. i ll be able to have more friends that way. i will also try getting a job this summer so i can have friends from there. then i ll be able to have human interaction like a normal fucking person.   amp  x200b   i m not very good at writing so sorry if anything doesn t really make sense. i think i got at least half the point across.,2020-05-25 16:54:33

2877,i know a lot of people lost money today because bitcoin and every other coin crashed down. i lost a lot of money  because i had no idea what i was doing. and then the app automatically sold everything  which left me with a huge loss.  i did not set up a stop loss  it just always happens with the app i wass using. i wasn t aware of that.   also  don t invest the money you may need in the near future. this will prevent you from suicide and losing everything. no one knows where the market will go. in essence  don t be me  because i bought at the top  everything dropped  auto sold  i had no idea what i was doing and lost everything. be careful   ,2021-05-19 16:43:05

3427,does anyone else have thoughts about their thoughts during meditation  like when i sit down i won t have regular thoughts  i have thoughts about thoughts that i have without having a thought first that i would be thinking about with this meta thought. instead i have meta thoughts about the state of my thoughts. or other times it s just absurdly empty to the point that it s  concerning. and then i ll have a thought about the lack of thoughts. is this normal  am i missing something important ,2021-07-27 23:45:32
3847,so i might have crippling depression and am only able to tell my cat about it  but hey  at least a cut an extremely toxic  friend  out of my life hopefully for good.   i don t want to say her name on here so i ll call her  bitch .   so bitch was a pretty shitty friend  but i had been friends with her since before i can remember and we were probably just best friends because i was a massive pushover and she was bossy so win win  right  well a couple years later  this girl  my actual best friend now  who i ll call amazing person  helped me realize that bitch is  in fact  an awful person. so then at that point bitch got really jealous that she wasn t my only friend  she wouldn t let me have any damn friends because if she did she wouldn t be able to threaten me with the  if you don t do  x  i won t be your friend anymore  . and she got us all to the principal on multiple occasions because she would start petty fights with us then blow it out of proportion when we tried to ignore her.   however  one day bitch made a pretty racist and not okay joke about ap  and she was pretty upset about it  so that s when i said no to that toxic mf and just yeeted her right out of my life. and now i hardly speak to her.   sorry if this was all over the place  i m just happy she s finally out of my life.,2020-02-12 23:06:00

9617,i would like to preface this under two things.  1. i know i m currently in a down moment or a low state of mind 2. most of this is going to come across as white boy first world blues  but please  listen.  i moved to switzerland in august of last year  after having lived in indonesia for two years  and thailand 5 years before that. i m from scotland. and the way of living here is so...disgusting.   everyone who goes to my school  admittedly  a private international one i am fortunate to go to  but can only attend due to my parents working there  we wouldn t be able to afford it for even one of my friend three brothers otherwise.  is a loaded  self obsessed  surface level human. they all wear the same clothes  listen to the same music  and all they want to do is spend lots of money. i can t do that. i don t have the means to afford to do that  i can t speak the language which is double isolating  and i m get scoffed at in public when people are able to tell. the sociopolitics of the country are that of straight white men in power  with no regards from the feminist  not including its third wave   lgbt rights  or even civil rights movements. racism is rampant  and society is a bubble of its own self funding morally bankrupt self. and yet  no one cares. they all adapt to it. i don t want to adopt  i want to die.  suicide seems to be a logical solution. don t get me wrong  i can socialise pretty well  i am no incel gamer joker  we live in a society  dwelling fuckwit  but i don t want to. i ve broken down scream crying about how living here makes me miserable  and how all i want to do is die. and i didn t feel any connection. i was given a disposable  things get better  message  or a  people will be very very sad if you go . if not  it was a toughen up  get used to it type message.   so i beg the question  if all i am is miserable  and no one is able to help me  why not just do it  i get out  i don t need to worry about this ever again. it would be a waking up call to all the people who don t get it  who never got it because they ve lived in a society where you can do what you want because we re apparently living in the setting of american psycho. i don t want to wait for it to get better  and i d genuinely rather die than conform to such a superficial and feelingless society.   and that s the outside  we haven t even begun to scratch the surface of the fact i hurt everyone around me  i am a constant burden and worry of my family  i fixate about the idea of not having to be here again.   i genuinely want to be what seems to be normal in this fucked up hellscape. i wish i didn t let any of this affect me  and just accepted it. i want to be able to spend upwards of 200 dollars a day doing standard things  only for my parents to drive me back home in their sports cars  not because it s what i genuinely want or think is how life should be  but because everyone else is doing it. i would try my hardest to fit in if i would be able to look in the mirror and not want to smash out of self disgust.   and if we re being honest  my death wouldn t cost shit. some people might get sad in the meantime until they find someone else to talk to. they d continue to ignore all the social and economic inequality in their world  hell  they d go on to propel it. i don t serve any message  and i m miserable here  so honestly why not    i am a sick person in a sick world and i want to make it better.,2020-03-01 11:02:48
9375,hi y all. i m joey and i m 16 y o. i ve been suffering from depression  anxiety and ocd for about 2 years now. i also have autism. i m currently getting help at school and i m having therapy. it seems fine on paper but i ve been thinking a lot about suicide lately. it doesn t seem to improve. i m numb all the time and can t seem to do anything nor talk to anyone. i don t have any friends and never receive messages. i ve not gone school for about 60  of the year so far and never felt relief or true hapiness in these past years. as a 16 y o kid in the netherlands  you have to attend school. you need to until you re 18. i feel isolated and lonely. being my age and having autism makes it hard for me to maintain a strong bond with someone. most people my age don t understand feeling depressed. i ve told almost everyone i talk to on a daily basis about my mental health and why i m not at school. about 2 of them  which were both girls  seemed to care... for less then a month. suicide seems like the answer even though i know it s not. something inside me wants to make my friends and family be filled with pain. that s the only way i know they cared about me. i would set an example for them. one that would show them how precious one single soul is and that they should be kind and talk to someone who seems sad and or lonely.,2020-02-29 17:55:55
95,i find if i struggle to acknowledge how my body  feels  in the moment  i literally name off body parts in my head and i find it helps my ability to feel that part of the body and become self aware. this may be related to the same mental process behind why we often don t acknowledge the presence of our tongues  or how often we blink   until we are forced to be made directly aware of it. ask yourself    how do my hips feel  my ankles  my toes ..   maybe someone else will find this useful. it s definitely made meditation way more enjoyable for me  given it takes less time  and for me to get in a state where i can let my mind wander.,2021-02-04 03:57:42
3814,   meditation  is a wonderful practice  but many people wonder when is the best time  for meditation. the answer will vary  depending on the individual and  the amount of time one has been meditating. some yoga teachers are very  specific about the optimum time for meditation  but some of us have very  strict work schedules.    morning meditation for early risers    morning   especially early morning  is traditionally believed to be the best time  for meditation  for several reasons. the first reason is  because of atmosphere  the world is still sleepy and quiet in the early  morning hours for the most part  depending on where one lives  and this  lends itself to a more meditative state automatically. another reason is  because one has  hopefully  just awakened from a good night s sleep and  sleep states have a special symbiotic relationship with meditation. one  carries the momentum of a restful sleep and meditates   building on the  foundation laid during the night  calming the mind and becoming  mindful. this state of being present within the moment is then carried  throughout the rest of the day.    exceptions to morning meditation    there  are exceptions to every rule  and it is important not to become  attached to a certain time of day. there is no magic time for  meditation. the time to meditate is when it is best for you. for  example  someone working the third shift should not feel obligated to  meditate at six a.m.  just because others have good results meditating  at that time. for that person  they may do better to meditate in the  evening  just before they head off to work.    night meditation for late risers    an  alternative time to meditate is before going to bed in the evening. for  some people  this could be their primary meditation time  for others   this would be their secondary meditation time. attaining a calmer state   through meditation before bed  can lead to some of the best sleep one  has experienced in their entire life. one of the primary causes of  sleepless nights is the mind s inability to cease its thinking long  enough for one to drift off to sleep. bringing stillness to the mind   through meditation  eliminates this problem.    brief meditation sessions    in  addition to a scheduled meditation  it is also helpful to try  mini meditation sessions throughout the day. these meditations need not  be long  even a few minutes will do. when an individual has already  trained his or her mind to be still through normal meditation sessions   it takes relatively little time to achieve that state throughout the  day.  just as the muscles in the physical body have a memory  so  does one s inner space. for those who only meditate for a few minutes   it must be remembered  an individual cannot realistically hope to reach  deep states of meditation and reap all the rewards of the practice  during short sessions. an individual  who regularly meditates for one  session a day of 20 to 30 minutes  will benefit from relatively small  blocks of stillness and mindfulness   interspersed throughout their  entire day.,2021-08-20 09:51:41
3145,especially when a random number calls your line  they have automated voice bots that can use your voice recording of yes as consent. which will allow them to sell your number to other automated call scams for a profit.   lastly if your on hold put yourself on mute. most people don t realize even if you hear hold music the other caller can have the ability to listen in. working for a call center the qa team told me they once had to call the cops on a caller that was on hold that they were monitoring. while over the hold music the qa team member found out the caller has specific details on a robbery they just made.,2021-05-26 16:40:24
166334,so my  21f  partner friend  22m   complicated status un related to this issue  has been going through a depressive episode for about 3 months now. our relationship ended at the beginning of august because of it but we got back in contact toward the end of that month. i am one of the few people  besides his family  that he wants to and feels comfortable talking to  hence why we kept in contact  but i fucked it up over the weekend. we were talking and he admitted he had lied hid that he had suicidal thoughts a few weeks ago. he insisted it was in the past and he hadn t had those thoughts for a while but when they were there they stuck around for a week or so. i was obviously scared  worried  and didn t know what to do. i had this fear he was hiding more or was still having those thoughts so i went through his phone when he left the room.  i already know this is incredibly wrong and a complete invasion of privacy so i don t need a lecture on that . i didn t find anything that gave an indication that he was still having those thoughts but i felt very guilty for having done it and i admitted what i did a few moments later when he came back.   he obviously felt feels very betrayed and violated. in the rough year that we were together going through his phone was something i had never done before and i am pissed at myself that i did it. i explained to him why i did it. that i basically was scared there was more he hadn t told me or he was still feeling this way. and he said he understood where i was coming from and that it was from a place of worry but it doesn t excuse what happened  which i agree with 100  . the conversation was left on a obvious sour note of both of us saying we aren t sure what this means for us moving forward. it has been three days since this and there s been no contact other than me sending an apology text the next day which he read and didn t respond to. i want to gain back his trust more than anything. our bond  but more specifically our trust communication  and openness was like no other and i feel like i just messed it all up in a moment where i felt very scared.     basically  my question is how do i gain his trust back  i know it is different for everyone but i am really struggling.   also  i reached out to his mom  the other person he has told everything to  and told her about his thoughts because he needs help and is procrastinating that process and that is not a luxury he has now. and he got even more upset at me for telling her. his family and mine all believe i did the right thing by telling his mom so i don t think i messed up there and i think he ll eventually get over that  it is just the going through his phone that i am worried about. i don t know how to win his trust back.,2021-09-15 13:16:37
119432,the only reason i m posting this is because i got curious and decided to see what my accounts first post was. i was surprised to see my previous post to this subreddit  had completely forgotten about it. i went through a rough time right before then  barely made it through my bad situation only because i had some extremely caring and supportive parents. afterwards   with proper therapy  medication  etc i really began making progress and became someone who did appreciate themselves and had found purpose in life.   unfortunately i made that common mistake of discontinuing use of mental health side since i felt so much better. i recognized the warning signs of depression  but just kind of put it off.  it quickly began to grow  and it felt like i feel back into old habits of negative thinking. before too long i noticed it had truly hampered my emotions.   i finally had to admit i needed help again  thinking i had caught it in time. started up therapy  started to lean on others for support. but it was just a bit too late. my relationship with my girlfriend imploded. i ve just about stopped any hobby i ve been interested in. i can barely put in the effort at work and it s cost me quite the opportunity to advance with what were easily achievable objectives.    looking back   my situation now isn t as bad as what it was 3 years ago. ive learned enough since then to not be a complete idiot and lose hope in life. still sucks though having to do it twice. i m sorta back on my feet with therapy  but i lost somethings i may never have again. i m ok with it i suppose.   i guess the while point of this im just feeling neutral. kinda like depression lite  and things will improve. thanks for reading i suppose.,2021-04-01 19:43:17

129393,i think i m a naturally happy person but the past 2 3 years have not been good in terms of my happiness. it all started when my first girlfriend broke up with me. i was 18 at the time and we had dated for 6 months. it was sudden one night everything was great and the next day she was done with me. all she said is that she lost feelings for me and even though i m grateful she told the truth it did hard a lot to hear that. that was the lowest i ve ever been and it took 2 3 months to really feel like i m myself again although i still got sad about being alone. im not really alone i have two friend groups and i talk to a handful everyday. i also have a large families and amazing parents yet i still feel alone and it s because i don t have that one piece and that s a girl to share my life with. i ve never been good with girls and it doesn t help that i m a bit of an introvert and have hearing damage so i have to wear hearing aids. i do think i m good looking so i don t think all the cards are against me. recently i went out with another girl who is just like me but more beautiful and quiet. she recently told me 2 weeks ago she doesn t know how she feels and wants to just be friends while she thinks some more. she s never been in a serious relationship and she s introverted so i believe her but it s been 2 weeks and nothing about it. we works together so we do talk a lot and it s not awkward between us and i do try to text her a few times a week. i feel like i m never going to find anyone. i wish i was more outgoing sometimes since i m pretty sure i m good looking but i don t have much of a personality to back it up. sorry got going on a rant i just wanted to get this off my chest a bit and see what people say.,2021-05-08 01:55:22
2344,we are 2 adults with kids. we have been close friends for years ever since we met at a baby group. we ve supported each other through thick and thin  enjoyed outings without kids to the cinema  cafes and restaurants  and chat daily on whatsapp about every nuance of our lives.  this week she just stopped. she didn t respond to my messages. i have sent several. i then sent one asking is all ok  she has seen it and not replied.  she s been a bit .... odd.... lately. she bumped into me in the park and basically ignored me while chatting on her phone to someone. she has made a few odd comments on text in the past  like how white people don t understand how difficult things are for ethnic minorities etc  i am white  and various other things like feel like digs at me.  now i m being ignored. we went from normal chit chat to her not responding to anything. i don t think anything dreadful has happened as she s posting on facebook constantly.  so what do i do  call her out on it  ask why  drop round to her house  call her  just leave it  it s going to really annoy me not knowing what i m supposed to have done or not done .,2021-05-18 14:51:45
16,i feel like i can now easily meditate for 20   30 minutes  multiple sessions a day.  still might sound a rookie number  but once even 5 mins was a huge deal for me . but i really struggle at being mindful. first of all  it s hard to remember that i ve to stay mindful. secondly  it s so easy to get your attention to breath while meditating than when you re doing your daily tasks.,2021-02-01 11:44:03
8226,my manager hasn t met with me or asked how i am in longer than i can remember. i feel unsupported. i m drowning. my work life balance is becoming non existent. all my boss sees is my estimated capacity and to him that means i m not over allocated  but that s not how i feel.   i have recently become so micromanaged and overworked that i am burn out  to tears. i am actively finding referrals through any contacts possible and recruiters. i am desperate to get out. 3 people recently quit and 3 more have given notice  across different teams.  the company i work for was recently acquired. a lot of my coworkers have left for higher paying jobs  despite the equity.  people will work just hard enough to keep their jobs in these kind of work environments. check on your team members  they are not units of work. they are people.,2021-10-13 00:29:38
160120,i ve come to accept that my life will never get better as long as i m the one who s living with it. it s been a lot of ups and downs  the events in my life fluctuating between good and bad  and you know what  that s normal  i know that s how life is. the thing is though  i ve realized i m the problem. i m so bad. i just hurt all the time because my soul is rotten and i can t just have good relationships with people or with myself. and i guess my question is  how can i ever be happy when i am who i am    that s besides the point though  the reason i m posting this is because tonight i plan to kill myself. no one knows  and no one will stop me. the only thing is  i m going to miss my cats. i love them so much  and i know they ll be okay because they have each other. but still  will i ever see them again  will i ever get to cuddle with them or feel their warm weight as they lay on my legs during cold nights  i know they re just cats  but they are everything to me and for so long they ve been the only things keeping me alive because they love me and i love them.   if god is real and he is merciful  hopefully i can spend my afterlife with them.,2021-08-24 00:18:54

4286,i m 22 and always thought i was lazy... im starting to belive most time of my life i have been depressed and didnt noticed till november 2019 where shit hit the fan and started to feel life has no meaning whats the point of existing if every decision i take always its for worse. last thing i did right it was finishing high school in 2016  then from 2017 everything went downhill for me  failed to get a stable job stopped going to the gym and realized i wasted 3 years of my life searching for a stable job instead of starting a career and lately spend most of the day locked in my room. listening to my favorite music  mostly pop punk punk rock  and sleep quite lot. sometimes i wanna sleep forever  or cease to exist  im a looser without job future and im not even sure what i want to do with my life.my father noticed i was quite angry silent and most of the time absent in my house he said to me he knows life its beating the shit out of me and apologised for not being an exemplar parent  my parents are separated since i was very young i dont even know the reason and dont really care about that  even apologised for not being strict or punish me enough and always let me get away. i dont blame him  nobody have a book to learn to be the perfect father mother. i dint feel its his fault   i feel destiny its making my life miserable with so much badluck. sorry for some typing errors i m from argentina and public education its bullshit all i learned its thanks to youtube music documentals vlogs  and video games.,2020-02-14 11:06:06
61001,i know it s a luxury to actually have the opprotunity to kill yourself. especially the way i tried to do it. almost everyday before today i used to think about how much better it would be if i never existed. it s kind of a long story as to exactly why  but thats the reason for me going through all the photo albums in my house and collecting all the photos of me and planning to burn it all with a lighter before i died. i m proabably talking about this situation way to casually  and i proabably should be using an alt account right now  and i shouldnt be typing this into an echo chamber  but i m so sick and tired of second guessing myself.  and i walked all the way to a bridge at 4 in the morning carrying a framed photo of myself in the pouring rain  only to walk straight back home. i m too much of a pussy to do it. i tried to throw the frame over the bridge. i just could not  no matter how hard i tried to muster up the courage. now i m tired and soaking wet  5 30 in the morning  sitting on the couch while waiting for my parents to wake up.  even if i regret i need to tell them. i need to tell someone. i ve been hiding how lonely i am the past 4 years of my life. and how i so desperately want someone to love. and how lazy ive been  because i have done exactly 0  of online schooling and i might not even be a high school senior this year. i want to tell them how much i miss hearing voices other than my own  and how much i miss my cousins because they re the closest thing i habe to a friend.   i want to tell them about the endless barrage of thoughts about worthlessness i go through on a daily basis. it might sound lile i m just bitching for no reason. after all  both my parents love me  i live in a nice apartment  i never experienced a tragedy or trauma. not even any bullying.  i have nothing to be depressed about  so why do i hate myself so much  i m so lucky. most people aren t so lucky to be in the position i am right now. most people here have way more life experince than me. i m just a dumb kid. so dumb  so quick to give up. i gave up on giving up. how the hell did this even happen    my parents are going to wake up soon. i just need someone to know. maybe i ll regret what  i m about to say but  i need to do this. i wont be able to reply to comments as fast as i want to  but i ll still try to read them.,2020-09-01 05:48:06
6070,have you guys  amp  gals ever got an meditation plateau   amp  how do you fully get back into that deep meditation state.  you know when you meditate  eyes closed  amp  you see colors  pulsing flashing lights  floating sensation  amp  everything    when i first started meditating 18 months ago  i experienced all type of supernatural things  like seeing beings in my peripheral vision  hearing whispers  amp  loud voices  seeing ufos  seeing imagines when i closed my eyes  lights flickering  glowing forming white orb  floating levitating when i closed my eyes to sleep astral projection  synchronicties etc.  is it the fear i absorbed from other people experiencez of deep meditation  the unknown  or is it because of my belief system  expectations  attachment etc  or is my technique not working anymore   because when i watch this video about meditation plateau  amp  i follow this guy technique about closing the eyes  being aware of your surroundings  amp  then body  then breath  amp  it worked  amp  i saw colors  amp  everything but when i do it again the next day it stop working.   months later  i went to get some crystals obsidian  amp  tourmaline  amp  put them in my pocket  amp  i was able to meditate  amp  it work for the next day but then it stop working  so what is going on  please help me. because i want to fully embrace this because before when i first started meditating i think my guide s were waiting to see me in the astral plane but me ego back off when i was laying down to sleep.  plus do you think these shadow beings cut it off  my meditation  because when i first saw them  thought they were benevolent extraterrestrials  amp  after january   march 2021 i think that s when the meditation plateau started etc. so was it the beings that i saw  made my ego say  nope    amp  stop my meditation   i have so many questions please help me,2022-01-09 07:33:58

130133, i m not feeling like myself lately  i just cant do it. i m always having these thoughts about killing myself but i m too afraid to do it. and it s not because i m actually afraid  it s because i m afraid of what will happen to my family if i do it. i got nobody to talk to but there is this one person i do want to talk to.  she has always had my back and has always listened to me when i talked to her. it s just that im afraid of how she will react or what she will do and it s even worse because i got trust issues. every now and then i ll get an anxiety attack and when i told my mam about it she just laughed because she thought i was over exaggerating. tbh if i killed myself it s not like anybody would even care.,2021-05-10 14:17:42

5096,so i ve been meditating for 7 days as of today and i m starting to wonder if i m falling half asleep or if this is just what meditation feels like.  i sit erect  but comfortably  count my breaths and focus on the rise and fall in my chest. i usually go for 20 minutes and after about 40 breaths i feel really at ease. my body kind of sinks a little  my jaw hangs slack and i feel at peace but i m aware of what s going on. i feel like i m consciously breathing and can feel the air moving but at the same time i feel like i have mini dreams  almost like visions  it sounds crazy typing it out but that s how i describe it. when my timer goes off  it startles me as if i was asleep but i don t feel the grogginess or puffy eyes.   anyone know what s likely happening here ,2021-11-07 06:40:45
123898,i get overwhelmed with my thoughts. a lot of the time i smack punch myself in the face as hard as i can until my ears ring. it s never left any bruises  but my face is often sore. it usually happens when i m feeling frustrated and helpless. i feel like i m split in two. i m overly optimistic and positive a lot. people in my life know me to have high energy and enthusiasm. i feel that way a lot. but when i m by myself i often feel depressed. i feel pessimistic and like i don t matter. all the relationships i have seem unauthentic. i start feeling like people i care about don t love me. relationships feel one sided. i hit myself as a way of telling the positive optimistic thoughts to stop and to be realistic. i hit myself to make myself realize i can t have what i feel i deserve. there s no point in being optimistic when my optimism might not be based in reality. i know that things change. i know that i won t feel this way forever. suddenly i ll open my eyes and be somewhere else. with new reasons to be happy  and new reasons to be sad.,2021-04-20 01:10:23

171538,i am 20 years old and am currently in pursuit of a ba in psychology online  a degree i know by itself is typically considered  useless  by our society. i enjoy psychology  though i have no idea what i will do with the degree post graduation. i ve already earned a general aa degree in pre nursing. initially  i was a nursing student  but i later realized that the field of nursing was not for me  i was only doing it to get practical knowledge in a field  as everyone suggests  and set the goal to simply get a bachelor s degree to satisfy the usual degree requirement for most jobs. i have always been hard on myself in terms of academics  as i am always striving to achieve a 4.0 and drive myself insane in the process.  i have been working as a waitress at a restaurant for the past 3 years. i ve been suffering from chronic anxiety  always repeating the same phrase in my head   what am i going to do with my life...   it seems as if everyone else has an idea of what they re doing in life while i am here getting a degree just to get a degree with no real plan. the upside of my college education is that i am getting paid to go to school  so i don t have any loans to worry about paying off. the downside  i don t know what i m doing it all for...  i have contemplated what i enjoy doing  but those thoughts are followed by the fear that all of my passions or skills are  useless  to the job market. i have skills in music  as i have taken both piano and guitar lessons and have created my own songs  and have performed before through recitals and street performances. i would say i am skilled at writing and communicating in general  though i feel like everyone is skilled in that aspect to the point it is meaningless to mention.  my goal in life has never been to become rich  but comfortable. i hope to live a relatively simple life in which i can work a job and have time within the week to do things i truly enjoy  music writing . it s just hard to know where to begin...   this anxiety i have worries me so much to the point i begin to lose morale if i get too caught up in my fearful thoughts of being a failure or being poor working minimum wage jobs forever. i know that i am a hard worker and am open to learning the skills of whatever job i pursue   but it s the fact that i worry no jobs will give me that chance compared to other applicants with my  useless  degree and limited work experience.  i m tired of feeling lost.  i miss my youthful days in which i could look at life and appreciate even the little things in the moment instead of being trapped contemplating the unknowns of the future. i feel like i don t even live life anymore. it is a constant grind of me scrambling to find a sense of direction with little to no avail. every day consists of me feeling as if i m not doing enough for myself.   i consider myself to be creative  as i am always driven when i am learning new musical performances  or when i am writing about my thoughts and ideas. i have considered investing in recording equipment that i can use to upload my performances online  compared to going to someone else s studio. then  the feeling of not doing enough kicks in. i think  there is no point in doing this  it won t get me a job  it s only a waste of time.   i seek advice from others that may relate to this struggle. i just want to be able to assure myself that i will be okay. i am trying the best i can to get it all figured out...,2021-10-04 14:36:00
2791,i was playing xbox when my brother got banned on xbox. we were playing fornite. there was 5 people in the party me  my brother  lucas  dalton and pushy galaxy. we ll call him pushy. my friend dalton reported my brother he got banned. my mom got on my xbox and went on the mic. here comes the bad part she questioned them who banned him. pushy said no one and started saying stuff. racial slurs. my mom is mexican. i m 50 percent caucasian and 50 percent mexican. he started saying stuff. after a few it cooled down and it was good. for me it was so awkward. now idk where pushy is. he changed gamertags. my friend dalton did ban him. he said he didn t want to get in trouble. i m still friends with them but i want to forget this. not a good memory. i kinda don t want to be friends with then anymore. dalton we have beef a lot. lucas a little beef. my brother a little beef. should i remove my friends  my brother olays with them a lot,2021-06-03 22:38:36

191625,when extremely depressed and without substances to numb myself  i can bring myself out of a funk by looking at violently dead people online. i don t enjoy it at all  but i think staring at it and focusing on it distracts me from my negative thoughts  and maybe i feel like  at least i m not that person.  by the time i ve processed my thoughts looking and thinking about these horrific images  what was bothering me before will have passed.  i wonder if it is somehow overwriting some inner ptsd with new ptsd     whatever it is  it works once in a blue moon.,2021-12-14 15:15:58

42436,just got completely fucking defeated this morning.       trigger warning for those who also have money eating issues      while this may seem dramatic  today was the last straw  i really don t know if i stood a chance of preventing another depressive swing.   let me give context of how i got to this point.  i was living with a group of friends in another state  away from my best friend that i grew up with and felt super alone with this group of people.  i lived with them for about a year and one girl in the group was convinced i was either trying to undermine her or steal her boyfriend. she purposely left me out of so many group things  knowing that i knew no one else in the state  and other girls in the friend group acknowledged in private that it was fucked up  but still didn t bother to invite me either.  while trying to find a job and struggling  i was working for instacart and ubereats  because a friend was telling me how they made so much money from it  and i ended up losing money despite how much i was working  because i couldn t afford my car payment  insurance and rent.   after having had enough i moved back to my mom s place and have been unemployed since january  and i  m pretty sure i can t get unemployment with an out of state license.   my weight has been up and down since last year and i just have had it  i don t want to spend the rest of my 20 s being the thickest one  for just once in my life  i want to be the skinny friend. if i can t be pretty  i can at least be thin. i was working out at first  but have been fasting more and more lately and i just want this one thing to go right.  for an extra fucking cherry on top  a guy that i ve been talking to for a few months now  since we reconnected after a year of not really talking. just started dating a girl  who sounded like an exact description of my personality and interests  and decided to text me about her  all the anime movies that are so great that she recommended   that i recommended to him a month ago . she honestly sounds like someone i would totally hangout with  but he just so clearly choose to start dating her  when i was right in front of him and we had been very flirty. all i can think  is she must be lighter than me and thinner than me and that isn t helping at all.  all this coupled with the fact that covid has pretty much canceled everything  i just feel really at a lose  and really alone in all of this.   today  i went to the bank to open a savings account to put my birthday money in it and realized i couldn t afford the  5 a month fee to just have the account and just left. it s such a small thing  but i have  100 to my name  a crippling amount of student loan debt  credit card debt  a car payment i can t afford and i just wanted this one thing to go right today.  i  just don t understand how anyone could say being in your 20 s are the best years of your life. it s just been hard. there have been so many times that i would rather just lay down and disappear  i can t think of anything worse  than having to just keep trying and trying only to be disappointed again and again.,2020-06-24 17:17:37
121973,wishes. luck. youth. they used to mean everything to me. and she fueled it all. we even found a way to make stomped out abandoned cigarette packs hold a wish. every night we were laying in the middle of the street pulling apart wish bones. i secretly always gave her the side i thought would get the wish. and before her i d never seen a shooting star in the sky. but those nights when we drank the moon s heroin  i almost always saw one. and i always knew what to wish for. i always begged and pleaded that we be endless. incredibly foolish and selfish. and yet that was every wish. every wish centered around how fucking bad i just wanted her in my life always. how i would do anything if i could just hold her hand forever. and we used to be so fucking pure. god. and i had been warned a million times. i had been reminded of what i am. they all told me. you re an opioid addict. you re bipolar. you are far too traumatized to love. and yet. i felt so innocent and young when i met her. it felt like every wish i d ever made had come true. the one i made that hot day in june when i decided no more. when i decided i would never cut another line of fentanyl. and i just wished that the stars please give me someone to love. someone to be loved by. and we were a couple of kids together. racing through streets at 2 am throwing eggs at peoples trucks. or dancing on picnic tables. or gulping down vodka before she played me another song on her guitar. and god. i wish i would have known. or listened. or something. because it all started to decay. and i realize now the reason we stuck together was because of trauma bonding. and as soon as i figured out her real age i should have run. i should have run for my fucking life. i should have saved her from myself. and me from her. and i know i shouldn t want her anymore. but still  every time i drive over the train tracks  or see 11 11  or watch a star fall from the sky  her name comes up first. and i love my new partner. i do. they are the first actually healthy person i ve loved. the first to respect my boundaries and set their own. and they make me so fucking happy. and i love them but i also know we are separate beings. and i don t need them to live. but i m so fucking confused. because for once i really believed i was loved. and safe. i believed i could trust her. and every time i fell into her warm amber eyes i could see our future. and it s so heartbreaking to let go of every little memory  especially the ones we had envisioned for the future. and it s especially impossible when our past still haunts me. i m unemployed again because background checks keep turning up that night in august when every window was blocked. and i spent the night in a cell. and i m so fucking scared that my stupidity and immaturity and desire to stay a kid is going to forever fuck up my life. and you keep saying i traumatized you and god am i sorry. and i m traumatized too. but still. for some fucking reason. there is this pull towards you always. like the moon with the fucking tide. and my ocean is so tumultuous. and i wanted to say i m sorry. i was toxic. i let all my trauma get in the way. i made it harder for you to leave. i insisted that we could make it through together when really we both had work we had to do. i begged you not to go and probably made you feel terribly guilty. i chose to hold shit in. i should have been the one to break up with you the second i knew you were lying. i should have said i knew. i knew you were strung out. and i shouldn t have hid my hurt from you. i always tried so fucking hard to act like you weren t tearing me apart. and i pretended that my love for you would be enough to make everything better. i never should have had sex with you. never. i should have listened to reason. and logic. i shouldn t have crawled in your window like a fucking fugitive running from the law just to hold you and sing with you and watch movies every night. and i should have left the second i saw your brown eyes turning blue. i m sorry i hurt you love. it will forever be my greatest regret. and all of our memories  they hurt more than anything else. and i wish. nothing. because i know we fucked it up. i fucked it up. we had the timing wrong. and wishing for you back would be stupid because we ve done far too much damage. and all i want is to talk to you again. and tell you. anything. just tell you anything. like i started a band. or i learned how to snowboard. or i taught my cat how to sit. or maggie died. your shitty gas station coffee is still in the back seat. and i wish we could at least be friends or something. but sometimes i think. i can t have anything i m addicted to. because it always corrupts the substance. and i was addicted to you. so someday. i hope that someday we can both stop hurting over it all. i hope someday i can stop hating myself for the mistakes i made with you and just get out of bed already. i hope someday maybe we can see each other and apologize. and know that we could have worked if only there had been patience. but more than anything. i hope you stay golden pony boy. i hope you just know how much i regret my choices. and you ll never see this. and i know i  embarrass you.  and i feel so fucking empty and lost. but i hope you don t. i hope you don t.,2021-04-09 15:46:09
71162,both 18 19 yr old girls btw   my best friend has been through a lot of traumas in her life and also throughout our friendship  including the most significant one of being sexually assaulted a few months ago.   i work at least 4 days a week and when i m not working i m doing homework or i m with my boyfriend  or i m having alone time  or i m spending time with my family  which honestly is like never because i m so busy . my best friend has had a deep downfall with her mental health the past few weeks regarding medication  breaking up with her bf  and the consistent trauma in ptsd and depression and anxiety she has. i want to help but whenever i can t hang out or i don t ask her to hang out it really hurts her. it s not that i don t want to  i just feel tired and it s not really something i think about that often because i m doing stuff and i just don t really necessarily need to even though i love her so much and care  i m an introvert and busy a lot.      now here s where it gets kinda weird  last week we decided to have a party and ended up getting super crossed and kissed and it was intense and we both agreed we don t actually like each other like that at all so we didn t really think anything of it. but the only thing is obviously i have a boyfriend. he has forgiven me but i told her i would need some space because of what i did i just feel guilty.     this week she asked me to hang out  what happened was only barely a week ago . i said yes but then after work i was just too tired and everything so i told her we could hang out in 2 days like we planned before. i could tell she was upset so she told me how upset and alone and angry she was because she needs interactions from people especially me and she feels like i don t care. i just feel like there s a lot of pressure on me and i m not sure what to do. i offered to hang out though so we re going to  but i just feel like her life is in my hands sometimes and i have major anxiety so idk. like i don t want her to be mad at me or feel that way  but i don t know what to do besides offer to hang out  and i feel like she s forgetting what happened or something... idk. i thought i was being a good friend until what happened and i can t tell if everything is all my fault and i m the worst or what  i want to help but i feel like life is swallowing me  what do i do next      thank u  lt 3,2020-10-10 22:01:13
2598,i moved back into my parents last year  and our house burned down last week. parents had insurance but not enough to cover all of my stuff and theirs. for only  20 a month  i would have gotten  15 000 for all of my stuff and i had a lot of stuff. instead i m getting  5 000 from my parents  which i feel bad for getting because they are not getting enough to rebuild the house.,2021-05-12 07:41:24

138802,moments of pure stillness  always bring pain. in stillness my thoughts are loud and i can t bear the weight. it s enough to put a crater in the earth. the pain inside of me is constantly screaming  she s constantly aching. my heart is stuck on a beat  my lungs can t grab any air. it s like the world is caving on top of me and the moment won t stop playing. nobody can hear when you fall if you re alone. no one will notice  not even the sound of your chest tearing. no one cares to stop and listen to the pain that flows through me. do you think people are scared to hear my story  because it hurts them or something  i would listen to my own pain if i wasn t scared of my own memories. then memories of not one time experiencing someone being there for me to tell me it wasn t my fault. how could i not want just one person to tell me all the things i should have heard when i desperately needed someone the most  when i had no one to hear me fall  when i was the most vulnerable and the most scared. i m still scared i m still vulnerable but now i m torn apart trying to put myself back together with the broken pieces.,2021-06-09 03:40:10

4395,now  any professional investor  or trader would be yelling do not do this  that is one of the dumbest things you could possibly do. yet here i am planning on buying a yacht in about 30 years. granted i get what they mean  like you shouldnt put your retirement funds into something as volatile as crypto  as you risk your retirement. but at the same time  people just dont realize how big crypto and blockchain are gonna get. like its starting to hit the main stream more and more every single day and its becoming easier and easier to access   for example you can literally transfer the funds from your existing traditional  roth  sep  or simple ira  as well as 401 k   or 403 b   into cryptocurrencies and other alternative assets  https   myaltoira.com crypto  and sites like that work directly through coinbase  and coinbase is absolutely legit. im starting to see more and more services pop up like this all the time  and its only a matter of time before all the people calling me an idiot for choosing crypto over conventional stocks and bonds realize they are just being boomers ,2021-06-30 05:27:20

11310,my husband s best friend has been his friend since high school  we re mid 30s now .  he was the first of his friends that i met and he has since become one of my best friends as well.  when my husband and i got married  we moved to a different state. this friend shared an interest in following us  but he had his own family and situation to think about  so he stayed back in our home town.  he s flown to see us multiple times over the years. we have never made a trip home to see the family without seeing him once or twice during the trip  even if it was just me and the kids without my husband. he s watched our kids grow and they know him well.  he s like their uncle at this point.  he confided in us a month ago that he was debating moving across the country to be closer to his family members who have moved there  also from our home town .  i immediately felt sad that he would be moving so far away. i looked up fight prices and it s 3x the cost to fly there at it is to fly to see him and family where he is now.   i completely understand why he would want to make this move to be closer to family  but i secretly hoped he decided not to because i didn t want things to change. i m sad that he won t be there when we visit and the cost of flights might lessen the number of times we see each other.  but i realized that i m being selfish in feeling this way. yes  we see him once or twice a year  but only for a few hours. the vast majority of our communication is via phone calls  texts  and social media anyway...so what difference will this make    maybe this move will make him happier  he ll be close to family again  there will be lots of new places to explore and keep him busy and new people to meet  maybe he ll finally find a partner  which he s struggled with in all this time in tbe same small town he grew up in .   conveniently  i know 2 other people who have moved to that state over the last few years. they haven t really been incentive enough for us to spend the money to go there  but i think he will be.  and when we do plan a trip  we can see them as well.   i m still really sad that he won t be there when we visit family.  all of our other friends have left the area  so it really is nothing but family now when we visit. but maybe it s time for some more adventuring across the country anyway. maybe our visits will be more special now because when we travel to see each other it will be strictly to see one another and the entire visit can be devoted to us  rather than split amongst family.  he knows he s welcome to come and stay here as long as he wants any time he wants  and we know the same will be true for us no matter where he lives.,2022-01-30 14:40:11

416,use soap and warm water and a tea towel or other soft cotton cloth. paper towels often have other cellulose fiber components that can cause micro scratches. even with super hard coatings the daily wash and clean  quickly at work using a paper towel  will kill your lenses. i  now use only liquid hand soap and warm water and dry with a kitchen tea towel and my lenses are good as new two years later and stay much cleaner due to the smoother surface and lack of micro scratches.,2021-02-19 03:45:26

112662,i can t even express happiness at this point. i ve been going through this half my life. my mother is toxic  my father is mentally abusive and while he doesn t hit me  his words can feel like a punch to the gut. he s always telling me to be a man like the one i stand before but he s not a man not even close. i m home all the time because coronavirus so i have no escape from them and school and football kept me out the house but  again  coronavirus. my depression pushed all my friends away long before covid. my family expects me to be this perfect little boy and i can t take it anymore. i ve been getting d s for a few months now  but i just can t find the motivation anymore. where am i supposed to get in life if all i have is me myself and i. i used to cope with the depression by reading  playing football and video games or on my phone but my dad ruined all of them. tore my books  takes my game constantly when ever he s drunk  broke my leg and 3 of my ribs by driving drunk with me in the passenger seat. my mom just watched him do it  with no shame. the only reason i have my phone right now is because they re out at the bar doing god knows what. so take a guess how i spend my days   exactly nothing but being my parents help and aid when i can t even walk without crutches. i m sorry i know this is a completely selfish thing to do but i just can t keep going like this. i want to have a future with kids and a wife  a suburban house with a white picket fence  a family dog but i won t be around long enough to see it happen. if your reading this just please pray for me  that it all gets better and i don t have to be that 16 year old kid that killed himself,2021-02-23 16:47:44
78922,i dunno why i feel like this. i have loving parents and some great friends. i shouldn t feel this way.  i don t get bullied per se  but i get outcasted  silent treatment  and there s this one guy who s always making homophobic comments to me  probably not realising that i m bi.  i had a sports tournament today and all i could hear all day was my name being thrown around behind my back and how shit i was at a sport i ve played for 10 years longer than most of them and also pretty much the only thing that makes me happy in life. everyone pretty much ignored me the entire day and one girl i know straight up told me to fuck off in front of 50 people.   now whenever i feel these thoughts i just feel empty and i want to do it  even if to get rid of this loneliness. but i shouldn t feel like this. if i were to tell someone about this they would probably laugh and say i was overreacting and i probably am. i m probably making a big deal out of nothing at all and you re all probably gonna tell me that  but i just need to vent.   i hate myself and most people hate me. i m going to keep trying to hold on but i dunno how long.  thanks for reading,2020-11-11 02:31:32

3057,morning guys  got a question for ya  this morning after i woke up i saw a light blue hexagon pattern all around me imposed on top of the normal world around me  it was also there when i closed my eyes  it dissipated after maybe 15 seconds. is it my eyes or something else    i sometimes experience it during meditation too  but less vividly.  and sometimes i see a different thing  it s as if everything is vibrating like when you re looking at a distance on the very hot road  the things in the distance seem to be vibrating but you just see the heat from the road s tarmac.   thanks.,2021-07-10 08:06:05

129453,i have been battling severe depression. the moments i m alone i spend crying  or tearing myself apart. my husband has already gone back into the office  but i have not  i do have a high paying job  just working from home . i am also pursuing my masters degree from home. he recognizes that i m depressed  but still tells me what i m doing with my days aren t good enough and i m a detriment to our relationship. i recognize this  but i m trying really hard not to be. my parents are both extremely busy  and i recently lost my last friend  a best friend i had for 7 years . i can t go seek help from a therapist because the moment i do i will lose my job  and i can t afford financial burden as we are in the middle of buying our first home. i decided to reconnect with the aforementioned friend because i have no one else. however  my husband does not like this person and is now upset i reached out to them.  i can t talk to my husband because he thinks my issues are over dramatic or dumb  and i can t talk to my best friend without creating issues in my marriage because my husband and best friend hate each other. i feel isolated  inadequate  and honestly wondering what the point of it all is.   i force myself to go to the gym 3 times a week  but i find myself comparing myself to everyone else there and feeling worse than before i went. the days i m at home i try to clean around the house  but it still isn t good enough for my husband and often times he comes home upset about something from work and i feel like he takes it out on me.   i am struggling with my own self worth and thoughts of suicide  but i feel like despite this i am still working really hard to be a functioning member of society. it s exhausting and i m not sure how much longer i can keep up the facade. i really want to get better  and i think i ve been doing a pretty good job despite the setbacks. i guess i m coming here more for validation support  since i can t seem to find any in my life. thanks for listening.,2021-05-08 09:32:42
5021,hey  i am looking for someone who would enjoy to either read books or watch k dramas with me  both would be great  d . sadly  i don t have many friends in real life who share these hobbies.  it would be cool if we could try to read watch something during the same time period and then exchange some thoughts about it online. if that is difficult i would also be happy if we just read watch different things and then share what we think about it and in that way recommend new things to each other.  for reading  i love fantasy  romance or contemporary novels. most often i read young adult but i would like to work my way through some classics. maybe we could exchange our goodreads accounts   as for kdramas i love anything slice of life  rom com  fantasy but i also have liked some horror  mystery and crime dramas but i haven t watched many of those.  feel free to message me if you are around my age and share my book or kdrama taste. maybe you could tell me about your favourite books kdramas to start ,2021-08-15 15:45:43

146474,long story short i ve been chronically ill and depressed for 17 years. i have never claimed disability even though i was probably eligible for it. i have worked on and off over my life but had long periods of unemployment due to health issues.  4 years ago i returned home to my parents after living away for a few years and life fell apart. i had been home for about 6 months and my mental health was rapidly declining. i hadn t worked  i d finished a long term relationship  i d come back from a very different life and and i was lost.   i decided to claim universal credit job seekers and get myself back on track. but my mum had had some inheritance money from my grandparents sitting in her account for many years and she decided to give it to me just before i claimed.  i didn t realise but there was a threshold for claiming that i now just exceeded  literally by a few hundred pounds. and i was not eligible to claim because of it.  i have now been at home for nearly 4 years. i have been in a living nightmare. my mental health has fallen apart and i have been at absolute rock bottom including regular suicidal thoughts and tendancies. i haven t worked this whole time and barely do a thing. i have sought help for mental health but i had the most awful traumatising experience and had all my 17 years of chronic health conditions disputed and was told i wasn t depressed and  just needed to take responsibility for my life . i was literally laughed out of the room after saying i was very close to suicide especially on one occasion.   i am now 37 and have thrown away the last part of my youth. i have been beyond utterly miserable and lost and ruined my and those around me s lives.  it dawned on me again today that had my mum not given me that inheritance money right then  i would have been able to claim universal credit and i would have been forced into getting a job and i would have been back on track. instead my severe anxiety  depression and health conditions stopped me from being able to make any decisions and i entered a bleak world of nothingness where i did nothing but sit in a world contemplating the pointlessness of existence  wailing myself to sleep in absolute desperation and feeling like the most worthless piece of meat ever to exist.   why did i just not give the money back and claim again. it would have forced me into a world of normality and i wouldn t be where i am.  i simply can t take it and every day is a nightmare. nothing seems worth it. i have no joy and everything seems pointless. i can t believe what i ve put myself and my family through. i don t think i can ever get over this and i m still just as trapped and unable to move on in my life. i m balling my eyes out now and i wish i d never existed.  please  i need some words of help.,2021-07-06 19:26:28

153686,i  21f  am someone supporting a person with severe depression. but i am the one who needs help now.  i have been seeing this guy  21m  since oct. 2019. we met at university  had an instant connection and started dating each other  until he suddenly disappeared. he didn t even go to classes anymore   he then told me he became severely depressed  this was almost two years ago  dec. 2019 .  when i met him  he was the most amazing person i know. he was incredibly smart  super funny  very sweet  he got me lunch during breaks and other small gestures   but also very awkward  he was afraid of horror movies  he didn t dare to be late  he didn t like taking the bus  and he was very awkward with our first kiss haha . he was also a big nerd. and he disgusted alcohol and smoking  and hated parties  just like me   he is different now   he started drinking  smoking and driving recklessly. and goes to many parties. he also cheats on exams. his house is a mess. and in general he just doesn t care about anything anymore. his awkwardness is gone. but the worst is his loss of emotions. i have to  fight  to be able to see him  considering his unresponsiveness   and i am tired.  i broke down last time we went for a walk  and i walked away. in the rain. just like a bad movie. he followed tho.  my breakdown didn t have a particular reason  just the way he behaves in general. it is hard to explain. he is just so  cold  and i don t recognize him at all. and i feel as if i am the only one who sees it  it tends to get very lonely.  i cried multiple times during our walk. but he kept making jokes and trying to  rationalize  the way i was feeling. it was as if seeing me cry didn t do anything to him at all  so i asked.  and he said that it did hurt him to see me like this  but that he didn t know how to process those feelings. he told me that i need to tell him what he needs to do or say  and that he will do it. does that mean that i am the only fucking person that could possibly make him  feel  again  is that the reason he acts so differently around me  because he is afraid of his emotions   i think  or well  i hope  his emotionless state is caused by his meds. he is slowly quitting them because he is  doing better . but i would like to hear some advice from you guys.  we agreed to talk when he gets back from vacation next week. i offered him to go and see a therapist myself too.. in order to try and understand him better. idk what else to do   my question  what are your experiences with antidepressants  and what would be important to ask him during our convo   during the months he disappeared i never stopped texting him  eventho i didn t get responses. i read books about depression  i got him summaries for classes  i defended him among mutual friends  i even made him a gigantic box with presents and food. and i made him  depression journals   see previous post .   when he slowly got better i dragged him with me to the library to study and took him for walks. literally  drag  him because it was hard to get a response.  some other suggestions of what i could do for support would be appreciated.  thanks so much,2021-08-01 18:48:41
9918,i see that very often  don t feel angry about your colleagues   or manager   to be less friendly at work than they are at the bar or during work seminars. it s important to make the distinction between the actual person and the colleague.  no matter how your coworkers re friendly during hang time  they have to be professional the next day  even if it means to reprimand you. don t make yourself inconfortable expecting favor treatment because of how friendly you can get with your coworkers.,2021-11-29 21:37:08
203415,my depression started 4 years ago. before that  i was like  the perfect girl . i was thin  hard working  and would care about the  important things . now i think i m getting better  but people still say i used to be better before depression.  my parents tell me how i used to be this brilliant student  and i m not anymore. my boyfriend told me i used to be more attractive. and i know those things are true  but it hurts to hear them anyway. how to compete with a person that doesn t exist anymore ,2022-01-31 09:24:05
12955,i told my therapist about an incident that happened last saturday. i  told her about how i took some of my meds to hurt myself  not an attempt  and she asked to talk to my psychiatrist about not taking a new med she put my on cause of the incident and the weight gain side effect. now i m really anxious cause my psychiatrist wants to have a appointment sooner... my mom doesn t know about the pills and definitely is qustioning why my psychiatrist wants to meet again so soon and that s making me scared of her finding out  i was in the hospital in october for suicidal thoughts and i m really scared she ll make me go back to  hospital.,2020-03-11 16:16:19
27801,i worked graveyard for almost a year and my company forced me to days. the loss of pay differential and completely changing my sleep schedule has made me depressed again. i get home at 6 30 pm and i go straight to bed. just like a month or two ago  i started to get better from seasonal depression. everyone kept telling me that i ll feel better when i move to days. but really it s the same shit  but with less pay. i work 13 hour shifts  sleep for 7 or 8 hours  and that leaves me with like 4 hours to eat  commute to and from work  and relax. and it s harder to sleep at 7 or 8 pm than in the morning.,2020-05-04 22:15:01

130860, i m close to finish my studies in a graphic design school and because we are close to the graduation  next week we need to choose a workplace to do practicum. but to do practicum to a workplace  we first need to pass an interview with the employer and i m so scared  this afternoon after i received the email with the information  i had a panic attack and i ended up under a blanket in the corner of my room. i still feel my breath heavy when i think about it  i barely managed to get to this point  there were so many times i wanted to quit  but my parents pushed me to finish my studies and now i don t know what to do     moving away from my anxiety issues  i have to speak to a person that is not my parents or my sister for five months or more  even to my teachers i have barely spoken to  i always end up answering in one word which most of the times is a yes or a no. i have no friends and no other family members  my social skill is a big zero. i don t even get out of the house  i m an extreme shut in   not even my working skills are any good   i m so scared  there is no way i m gonna pass any interview  i m doomed  once the interview starts i m gonna lose my ability to breath again.,2021-05-12 19:25:43
129965,but i just can t keep it clean. tonight  while i was trying to go to sleep for work tomorrow  i heard a roach scrabbling about.  we caught it but still.  and it s my fault too for leaving some easter candy out. it makes me feel sick and disgusted at myself. the sad thing is  it s cleaner now than it has been. and still it s disgusting.  my mom keeps lecturing me about having piles of clothing and easter bags and etc. and it makes me feel even worse. i feel like a hypocrite since i m always fastidiously neat at my job and can t keep my own room clean. everyone thinks i m so great  but i m not. i hate who i am as a person.  just a rant to try to help me relax enough to go to sleep... i hate this miserable existence and i hate myself.,2021-05-10 00:43:38
171768,i often think about this and i hate myself for the way i am because it limits me from being able to do so many things in life and live up to my fullest potential. it s especially hard when you see your friends and peers excelling in life  getting good jobs and forming great relationships.   i have rejected many client facing jobs because it gives me social anxiety. i am highly sensitive and many of my previous jobs gave me depression as i was often  too quiet  or just did not fit in with the rest. i ve ended up taking up an operational job which pays a lot lower with my years of working experience.   does it ever gets easier for us ,2021-10-05 10:27:48
4241,  i don t really have a lot to say. but i m bored mindless out of everything and down to some conversation. it doesn t have to be a long dedicated thing  but i ll be nice to have someone or a couple of people to always keep me sane .    thank you for accepting this lack luster post  lt 3,2021-07-22 18:17:26
117802,if i have to live out an entire lifetime feeling every negative emotion  so intensely   i mma kms within the next year.  my dad harps on me about how i m too soft. it s not something i can change. i don t have it in me to go kill small animals or do whatever it takes to have less empathy for others.,2021-03-17 07:44:19
970,does anybody else experience this    it doesn t happen during all of my meditations  rather the rare 1 in 10.   when it does happen however  it feels like my body radiates this specific  pleasure  or  relaxation . i felt this same way when i smoked weed months ago.   is this a natural  high   something i should be careful of divulging into ,2021-03-30 10:24:57
5721,when you release the tension in your jaw or relax it  does your jaw drop vertically  does your lower jaw move fully backward towards the floor  away from your front teeth  or are you able to relax it while keeping it in the normal position it rests in otherwise while not meditating    when i relax it i unintentionally let it slide backwards and it feels strange and almost unhealthy  is this normal ,2021-12-18 13:05:03
1582,for my recent birthday  my husband bought me one of those cool little temporary plastic greenhouses with the plastic wrap and the shelves inside  for me to start seeds and tend to my plants in. in mid march  i started having trouble keeping bees out of it   all kinds  but especially wasps and the like. they find their way in but then don t understand how to get out  and i am allergic and would be unable to go into my greenhouse and tend to plants until they finally figured it out  only to have the process repeat.      i searched tips like fake wasp nests and keeping certain herbs around to deter them but had no luck until i stumbled upon a tiktok that mentioned that bees can t see the color red and that if you wanted to minimize contact with them  you should wear red. i took this new info and ran with it  as we had just purchased some 5 gallon empty pickle bucket from firehouse subs that just so happen to be red. i suspected the wasps were entering in the flap under the front door where the plastic did not go fully to the ground  and so i set the buckets up side by side like a weird little red wall in front of it.     i have not had a problem since. when i need to go in  it takes maybe 10 seconds to move them out of the way and once i m done  10 more seconds to put them back into place. they buzz all around the greenhouse but haven t gone inside since i started doing this. my husband is helping me brainstorm a way to stretch a small length of red fabric across it so i can have my buckets back for planting in.       if you are like me and have an outdoors area that the bees like and you want to keep the peace and avoid stings or harsh chemical sprays  try this approach first. find something red and stack it  hang it  drape it and see if you have success. i d love to know if it works for you.,2021-04-14 16:40:07
186008,i have been feeling like im doing nothing to push my life forward   i m running around a circle nothing new  wake up  study  sleep  repeatedly over and over again     my hobbies and interests are what s keeping my spirit alive enough to live out . i felt like their a waste of time and i escaped too much from my everyday life to achieve something  productive.   and i have to study for my tests which i don t have the strength and mood to do so  but i don t want to disappoint my grandparents  i m frusturated  what do i do ,2021-11-24 02:02:58
3467,meditation has hit the main stream in the last few years and has definitely been given a boost by people s struggles during the pandemic and this is  of course  a good thing.  however  i m becoming increasingly concerned that meditation is now being used to promote the same corny  corporate  manipulative  quasi macho self improvement crap that filled everyone s bookshelves in the 80 s and 90 s.  what do you guys think  am i just unnecessarily gatekeeping ,2021-07-31 09:03:26
14745,hi everyone   i ve been lurking on this subreddit for a while now  reading through posts and trying to find some guidance on what is it like to be a patient in a mental hospital  specifically in the uk  as a lot of the posts on here are regarding us facilities.   i ve been experiencing a severely deep depression for around 6 months now  been trying different medications and cbt to battle through a range of deep rooted issues. i ve been on suicide watch for a period of time also  as i have been suffering from suicidal thoughts and have an unhealthy relationship with self harming that i can t break. therapy is coming to a close now  and i am definitely not  better   whatever that means. all i want is some relief   relief from waking up and crying  not being able to cope  feeling like i m in so much emotional pain that it physically hurts and i want to it all go away. that s how i m spending my days. some days i can t get myself out of bed  i don t eat  all i can do is lay there and sob  while i feel my emotional pain manifest into physical pain. all i can think to myself is  what s the point  i never have been and never will be good enough for anyone .  i have regular check ins with my gp  and she has suggested medication and therapy as i am doing now. she has not mentioned hospital. however i have thought about hospital many times  and it has also been suggested to me by a close friend.   i feel i get to a point sometimes where i can t function  and my self harming behaviour is a sign i m not looking after myself. i know these things are not good for me  but i can t stop it  it s how i cope. i don t have a physical support network here to help me  my friends gave up on me before christmas  and my closest friend who is the only one who has stuck by me  has moved to australia. they talk to me everyday and help me by doing so  but i don t have their physical support here  which was such a help to me. there s a chance i may see them at the end of june  but i m not sure now. i ve been surviving on my own  but it s been one of the most difficult times of my life so far  and i miss the support more than anything.  i ve been researching mental hospitals in the uk  and being admitted as a voluntary patient. i ve heard information saying mixed things  that the process has to happen via a gp referral  or that i can take myself into my nearest mental hospital and admit myself and they will assess me there  can anyone give me any information about their experiences in mental hospitals in the uk  just to clarify i am talking about nhs hospitals  not private.   anything regarding admission  your time there  facilities  treatment  how long you stayed  voluntary or involuntary  what happened after you were discharged  or did you leave on your own account    i ve exhausted so many options now  and i am seriously struggling. i don t know what to do anymore  and i m scared of how much worse i might get. my close friend who is in australia has told me not to do anything silly  i think we can all work out what that is   and i would never want to make them angry  upset or hurt them. they mean so much to me  in fact  everything if i m being honest  and it s hard to put into words  and making them feel any of those things would destroy me  but when i get into a dark place  i m not myself  i can t think straight  i act out irrationally  and the fact that i can t see them  to get respite and to feel safe is hard.   any information i could get would really help me. i m scared.   thank you,2020-03-18 16:37:19
6107,try as i might  i can t tell you how often something like this happens     guided meditation     feel the the energy from the earth  the sun  the air  flowing into you     my brain     with your powers combined i am captain planet   not quite the path to enlightenment  but hey  at least i m environmentally conscious  or a sucker for 90s pop culture. take your pick ,2022-01-10 21:14:34
138524,i haven t relapsed into an episode like this in a while. i feel constantly sick to my stomach and utterly hopeless.  my girlfriend doesn t show me any affection  no hugs  kisses  i love you  nothing. starting to believe she s done with  us  and i don t blame her.   i used to workout daily and i haven t done that in a while  feel like i m withering away slowly.  my uni work should be done now but it isn t  it s stressing me out and bringing my mood down as well.  i ve been looking for a job for 2 months now and haven t managed to get anything.  i feel useless  like i m trudging through a swamp just sinking.  the plan is to work out daily again  keep applying to jobs and try to re build some self worth. i ll be back in a week. if i haven t made any amount of progress i don t see the point in carrying on anymore. would like some support but i feel like i m not going to get it anywhere. i m lost  alone  tired  stressed and struggling to find any amount of hope.,2021-06-08 05:55:06

74775,i like started getting depressed in grade 8 n i just remember when i was in 7th grade i was super loud n funny n i had so many friends lmao. when grade 8 came along i stopped talking  i had a complete personality change. my friends always gave me shit  n still do for not being the same person. it s so annoying. i literally have like one friend who knows me and none of my friends even try getting to know the new me  even after 5 years.,2020-10-25 19:48:37
9972,i was hoping to meet some people on here even though it never works  i wanted to try meeting others anyway. i live in us and i mostly enjoy games  youtube  politics and circuitry. i prefer people near my age group so 20  year old creeps will be recognized and ignored. i m also ignoring post comments  people complain too much but my dm s are open if you d like to talk  that s all.,2021-12-25 13:00:36
13519,i posted this in another community and i thought i d put it here too  why not.  i ve  never posted something like this  but for once i ve no one  nowhere and  not even the will to reach out in my personal life anymore. i have  nowhere else to turn.  i had a  psychiatry appointment today  one i ve been waiting for for uite a  while  you could say i ve been waiting nearly a year since being told  i d be put straight into another mental health service and wouldn t be  left alone out in the deep end. you can probably guess where this  story s going.  the psychiatrist  heading the community service that i was in until this morning decided  to discharge me  against my wishes. she didn t allow me to speak in the  appointment. when i could get a few words in she would cut me off. she  wrote off some points that i wanted to bring up as simple personality  traits and that i can t compare myself to others  that each person is  different. well if it were that simple i wouldn t be in the services.  she said that i shouldn t strive to label myself or something when i  brought up that i suspect i ve autism. no matter how many times i said  how it s getting more and more difficult to exist in day to day life  with others i wasn t listened to.  she  told me what i thought  or what i went through. i said my last  psychiatrist dismissed a lot my issues. she said that he didn t  even  though these are two completely different services. this doctor in  particular stated that i don t have depression and the source of most of  my issues is me over exaggerating things in my head. never got to say  that because she wasn t interested in listening to me.  from  the beginning she had an opinion of me that i felt like i was going to  have to fight against  and she never let go of it  leading her to  finally discharge me. she said that i don t appear to like the service   that it s not beneficial  that i m not happy with it and that i always  had something to say about it. from the beginning of my attendance to  this service i was never entirely sure of how i was being deal with. i  had a main appointment at the beginning where she had to get to know me  and my history. i was at the end of my rope at that point in my life due  to trying to finish school and being in an abusive relationship where i  was gaslit into thinking i was an awful broken person. i had very few   maybe 2 max i think   check in  appointments later where 2 different  doctors did just that  check in on me and asking basic uestions to write  down the answers to in my file. at these points in my life i was  cripplingly depressed  had no idea what was going on at all due to  yk   trauma. my head was beyond broken and i couldn t articulate much other  than  i feel terrible  in those appointments. today she backtracked on  those check ins  that they were proper meetings  that i didn t like the  service sure i can t even make sense of what she said now as i m writing  this. i had no appointment during the next period of my life where i  genuinely just wanted to do away with myself which is a sentiment that  has yet to leave me and has been massively exasperated from today.  one  of the doctor s even said in the meetings i ve had before that there was  nothing he could really help me with because he didn t know me  that it  was a bit pointless to be doing mindfulness exercises  that he didn t  believe in half that shit. the other doctor ended up hugging me at the  end of our meeting because i was so fucking depressing. and today there  was this bitch again.  apologies if the above paragraph isn t all that clear  i m truly confused as to what my situation is too.  she  told me that i have no mental illnesses and cut me off whenever i tried  to say that i had no official diagnosis   just recommendations and  screenings because i never got the time of day anywhere. the only chance  that i had originally was the last psychiatrist that demeaned me. she  replied to me in these exact words   we re doctors  not imbeciles. these  doctors haven t found anything in you before. they would ve seen  something if there was.  i had two check in appointments and that was  it. she also said that i ve already been diagnosed with aspergers. i  haven t been  the child health service said it was a likely possibility  and wrote a recommendation about it in my file. i was seen very little  times because i was over 18 when they finally saw me. they told me  explicitly that this wasn t an official diagnosis. if it was  my  previous service would have known. she refused to listen and rejected  that.  i  began tearing up at some point  leading to full blown sobbing in the  end  to which her only response was  at the door to the office    name    come on  i have to move on to the next person.  i  broke down crying on the floor of the toilet inside. i couldn t go out  in public in that condition. this is possibly the lowest i ve felt since  i  1  was left on the floor of my abusive ex boyfriend s floor to curl  into a fetal position and cry  and 2  crying in the school bathroom and  cutting my arm after being demeaned by my principal for the sin of  reaching out for help.  this seuence of events has happened far too often for me to not give up finally  relapse into stuff or you know.,2020-03-13 13:22:17
179370,so from where can i start  well to see it in a way i for my whole life have walked on a path of throns to achieve the goal which was waiting for me at the end of the thorns path only to discover that it was all a mirage  the more i tried to get close to the never achieveable quest the more it got distant to me  walking on the hurtfull path on and on seeing my dreams turn into dust  from something so great and majestic to nothingness just mere particles that also at this point i don t think even the particles are real or just a creation of my mind for the self defence of my sanity giving just a glimpse of hope that maybe if i am able to collect these particles and somehow join them maybe..........just maybe i will be able to recreate that which i starve.  so there no start or end to my whole story  but after giving a good look i think that there is a start...................... looks like i never began  i just kept circling the start line thinking i am near to the end to the goal. just a mirage,2021-11-01 14:35:42
40252,so i have posted some updates on this but i am now 2 weeks into therapy and over a week into meds  they did double my dose which has left me dizzy lots.   i am though feeling far more positive  have less than zero hunger lately too but  tons of energy normally. i still am fighting hard with my anxiety which has moved from the feeling of being punched in the gut if you have anxiety like this too i am really sorry it sucks  to now an odd feeling of a slight burn in my chest when it is flaring up.  the added energy and attitude has been noticed heavily in my house  ex wife is still leaving but the kids are loving time with me  daughter has even asked to get into photography with me  we own a few high end cameras  so we have done a few nature walks now to take photos and everything it was awesome.  another very odd thing i have noticed  i started 5 years ago a company  we are kind of a marketing company and youtube channel  we were making good money but i dedicated tons of time to it. since this started i have zero desire to do anything with it  asked the team to take it over  and honestly started selling everything from it. i cannot even play a game anymore without thinking  what a waste of time this is  i honestly was addicted to gaming before this as an escape but now i just have zero desire.  this does kind of hurt me as some of my best friends we used to game every night now we all just chat at work but after work  i have zero desire to game or jump in a chat.  is this possibly part of the depression before  was this only an escape and now that i am starting to recover i no longer want the escape    last thing ending on positive  now down to 189lb for the first time since i was 22   ,2020-06-17 10:16:14

170270,i guess i have no shame at this point so i ll just tell a story about me  in june of 2021  not that long ago but it s felt like years  i began slowly diving head first into depression. i began to withdraw from anything social and locked myself away for days on end. i had nothing  noone  and nothing to hope for or nowhere to go. before all of this i had been learning how to be a more peaceful person  i have bipolar disorder  and i somehow  stupid of me  began to cycle my depression into hate gradually  i had a half of a month where i felt fine after i got through a rough patch but i m going right back in. and i  was not indoctrinated  optionally   joined  the far right. though i m aware that this is making me even worse at this point i have nothing else to think about.  i d like to say though   i began to put my hate into leftism big time  not a nazi or anything like that  just hate socialism   idfk why i m such an idiot  i deserve this shit for my stupidity but idk why it has to continue with no hope ahead of me.,2021-09-30 00:18:56

6960,if you genuinely feel they need improvement in x  y  z  just tell them in person. but don t write these down in the review. ultimately the argument can be made that it doesn t matter  but it does matter. and imo  they d appreciate it far more if you tell them what they need to know   in person. they ll appreciate it a lot more and you ll actually help their career. what i don t advocate is people that aren t honest in their reviews   because while that may help for that instant in time  it won t help them in the long run. sometimes you do need constructive criticism and constructive feedback  but ironically a performance evaluation isn t where they need it. if it s a manager  it s a different story. then in that case  it s fine to list what you need to. but also as a few lpts have mentioned  never assume that what you write is anonymous. assume they know who you are and that you wrote it. but as mentioned  if it s a colleague or a friend you genuinely want to help in the workplace  tell them flat out  hey i m going to write this as your evaluation   but to be helpful and truthful   i think your areas of improvement could be a  b  c but i won t put these into the evaluation.,2021-09-06 10:23:22

121052,i got sent to a stress center after i attempted suicide two years ago. i ve gotten to a point where i m even lower than i was at my lowest. and yet  it s so much more painful because i just don t have the energy to die.  it s honestly worse than being able to attempt. because  i have the resources  i m not afraid of death  i want to die  yet my exhaustion is so prominent that i m simply to tired to end it all. i m desperate to just leave yet sleep sounds so much better. i m just so done with myself.,2021-04-06 19:28:50
135479,i m not trying to be rude or disrespectful to anyone who suffers from depression no matter who claims it. i get sometimes it s not always so visible and some peoples defence mechanisms are different.  but one thing i notice is someone will occasionally tell me how often they have massive mental breakdowns and start crying over the tiniest thing. but everyday they seem quite energetic  happy  motivated and content   again  depression isn t visible like this  but i for one cant even smile most days of the week. i barely have the energy to drag myself out of bed  yet some of the happiest looking people i come across get so much attention on social media as soon as they announce that they are suffering.. like  what     it s not a complaint it s just a surprise  if anything.,2021-05-28 16:35:53
17216,hello all. with this pandemic going around  i ve been thinking a lot about death.  i have wanted to kill myself many times before  but now that i could potentially be killed by random contact with a virus i am suddenly horribly afraid to die.  i think it s because i lack control in that situation  whereas if i choose to kill myself then i m the one in control.  what are your thoughts on this  have you all been feeling the same way about death recently  and how do you cope with a fear of dying ,2020-03-28 03:22:37
73157,i made tens of posts on my different accounts  i talked to many friends  which are now gone because they don t care about me   but now i have no friends and also my parents stopped really caring  nobody cares anymore. people only judge me now. i ve only been attacked for acting miserable  misunderstood or completely ignored. i fucking hate having to post here because no one else cares. reddit doesn t even care either. every post i make gets either ignored as well  down voted to the oblivion or i get people who tell me the same cheezy  it gets better  shit. every fucking month it gets worse. people told me that i ll get better but it s the opposite. now i m at the stage of contemplating and planning suicide. is this  getting better    it s just a matter of time when i will finally take my life. and thanks to all the people that only contribute to my reasons to finally end it.  everyone just really wants me dead. and my luck makes it look like i m really not wanted here and that i m clearly wasting oxygen on this damn planet,2020-10-18 14:04:34
119767, thing is  i ve been depressed 9 10 years now. im 21m. i ve been unemployed for 1.5 years  typical living in parents basement. i can t even look for a job thats how depressed i am. i didn t even look for a job. i dropped out of college because i m beyond useless. literally i feel nothing  aside from pain or anger anxiety all god damn day long. im so bored of everything at this point. no one finds me attractive despite  putting myself out there   lifted weights for years  did nofap noporn  all that shit  meditated lots  did alot. like i have no damn personality tho  depression killed all of me it fucking sucks. thats why i just dont even try anymore for anything. no point of me doing anything when im depressed. honestly  i just wanna kill myself. i went from being religious to non religious  and meh if there is a god its obvious it hates me. so if there is hell after this hell atleast this life prepared me. i mean i am sorry to my parents but like  the fuck can i do. i dont wanna live. i ve heard all the fucking advice in the world  i ve tried so much. i m tired. nothing works anymore. pyschedelics fucked my head up so much that weed no longer works  alcohol doesn t. nothing does. no one cares either and even if they do it changes nothing. fuck suicide is so tempting.,2021-04-02 22:21:02

195770,i feel like i have this huge weight on me like i can t breathe. i don t feel happiness i m just sort of numb to everything. i can t find any joy in the things i normally do. it s getting harder to pretend that i m okay. i m so alone and i don t know how to fix it. i keep waiting for life to get better but i think i m gonna be crushed under the heavyness of the emptyness i feel. i don t know if this makes sense but whatever,2022-01-01 02:04:25
16376,i feel so alone right now and it s not due to this virus.   i don t even know how to fully describe what i feel  like no one cares about me. like i don t even deserve love. nothing matters. everything is king irritable. or cry. it was so sudden too. like i was perfectly fine and feeling okay and then the next second i was in tears. idk what posting here is even supposed to accomplish. i wish i could just sleep.,2020-03-24 19:34:20
9303,as the title says  if you become rich of stocks crypto or anything of the sort  don t tell anyone.  why you ask  when people talk about it they will make it out like  you ve won the lottery   got lucky. winning some sort of jackpot. and that your earnings was not hard earned and undeserved.   this can lead to being viewed differently by friends and family  so do your self a favour and keep your wealth to yourself.,2021-11-09 16:04:46
4474,last night i had one of the worst panic attacks in my life. i m currently getting off medication i was on for 1.5 years  benzos  and it s rough. my hands and face went numb in waves of panic. i truly was convinced i was dying for 2 hours.    anyways  i ve meditated before with less baseline anxiety and it helped a lot after a month of doing it but i stopped for some reason. now however  meditation is 2x as hard because of the increased anxiety and panic attacks but i want to be able to meditate daily and work my way up to being able to meditate like i did  30 40 minutes daily .    what are the best meditation practices or videos specifically for anxiety  panic attacks  and insomnia sometimes   i do guided meditations now but i was wanting opinions on what you guys do and also the best way to start out when you feel like anxiety is making it near impossible most days. thanks ,2021-09-29 10:34:09
9923,i m a gamer dude who enjoys working on my pos car. was recently dumped and it completely collapsed my self esteem. no surviving family members to talk to  and the relationship itself alienated me from any friends i had. i work doordash so it s not a job where i can get a ton of social interaction.  i tried making a profile on tinder to see if i can find some friends there  but most people on there are looking for relationships or hookups so that ended up being a dead end.   i m 33 and i live in lexington. if you play pc games  politics  or listen to podcasts like behind the bastards or knowledge fight  i m your guy.  right now i m kind of on shaky footing emotionally  but i promise not to bring anyone down.,2021-12-24 01:51:52
78324,i m in uni and have had my own apartment for over a year before the pandemic. i kept it because i still go to uni  but online and have a job here.   i ve been depressed for years but it was manageable because i was at least around peers and had a routine i couldn t really fuck off.   online school has absolutely killed me. every day i am getting worse and worse. i don t remember the past few months but my body is killing me  my apartment is filthy and i am realizing how fucked i ve been just laying in bed every day waiting for the weeks to end.   i cannot do uni in a studio apartment anymore. i ve developed anxiety to even go outside  i used to go on long walks and get coffee  just enjoy myself but now i m terrified to even step outside and take my trash out.   i m only 20 and feel like my life is over. there s so much wrong with me and feel like i m a walking corpse.   i m thinking about moving home because uni is going to be online in the spring  and i don t see any light if i keep living alone. i hate living with my family and was depressed in a different way there  but it seems better than this hell i ve been forced to create for myself.   i m disappointed in myself,2020-11-09 15:18:23
8903,for some people this seems like common sense but a lot of people who have never played an instrument don t understand.  i play the guitar and the banjo  and i can t tell you how many times people will ask me a question while i am clearly in the middle of a song. it s really hard to respond to a question and play at the same time  so the only options you have are to completely stop playing the song before its finished  try to answer the question and mess up your playing  or just not say anything which can come off as rude.   furthermore if you do for some reason ask a question and they look at you but don t respond  now you know why.,2021-10-29 18:30:38
9370,i have always been slightly disgusted by the sponges growing bacteria in the sink of my friends and relatives. even if you make a point of keeping them clean and dry  they are quickly falling appart.  as an alternative  you can use microfiber cloths for everything a sponge is tradionnally used   washing dishes  cleaning the tables  the bathroom.... they dry faster than sponges  last longer  can be organized by colors and  most importantly  they can be washed.  on you are done using one  simply toss it in the laundry bag. a pack of ten is enough to always have some fresh cloths ready and it will last several years.,2021-11-11 14:47:10
40821,am i faking depressing  i don t feel like i m thinking  but i m still sad. idk if this is normal or if i m inane.i feel crazy. it s kinda like i don t have thoughts other than the once in a while  you re fat  or  no one likes you  or  why are you like this   i feel like shit but have no reason to be like this. it kinda feels like there are eyes constantly on me  like someone sees every mistake i make. there s a voice but it is taking over me  like stealing who i am and replacing me with someone who will hate and criticize every moment i make. idk what is happening.,2020-06-19 05:34:44
10736,i frequently see posts on  say  r aita and r relationship advice about folks constantly receiving calls and texts from their parents  gfs  bfs  work  sos  etc. and being berated for not answering the call or replying to the text in a timely manner. often  in their post  the op asks something like  aita for not picking up the call replying to the text    the solutions is simple   get yourself a  land line  phone and give them that number.  and never pick up the calls on the landline  jeez don t even get an answering machine service machine for the land line.,2021-12-21 16:39:47
192341,   related posts      my mom...  https   www.reddit.com r depression comments qy8t4c my mom      my absolution  https   www.reddit.com r depression comments r58yqu my absolution 22m       post  first off  i don t want to hear any of the  you can t help everyone  bs that sound way too much like an excuse to not be one.  pretty recently  i found what i was always meant to be  the last thing that stands between you and the unescapable hell of your own making. the thing is  i m afraid it s gonna take way too long for me to properly do it.  sure  i always thought i d start with the one person that matters most to me and work my way up  broadening my reach  helping more and more as i go. although it sounds like the start of  negotiation  to not do it  i m very very motivated to make it  it s just that sometimes it really feels impossible. i know i set myself up to try and achieve the impossible with this  and that it s normal to feel like it s an impossible task  but somehow this keeps dragging me back a little.  for instance  i can t even bring myself to stand up to my mom and tell her she needs to stop acting like a two faced bitch from highschool and start acting like a grown up. i can t bring myself to tell her to stop treating my father and grandfather like that  especially right in front of me as if she thinks i d ever be okay with that. i finally realized she s always been like that and that she may never have been the kind woman i thought her to be  that it s just an involuntary fa ade she wears.  quite frankly  i m this close to telling her that if she doesn t stop she will lose one son in the process. i know i have the great power  but i m not sure i can handle the great responsibilities that come with it  my heart has been allowed to bloom by the kindest person i ve ever had the chance to encounter and i m trying to do the right thing to everyone i know and encounter  but it s so hard.,2021-12-17 17:35:27
69971,i just feel like it would be easier. i have a beautiful girlfriend  hobbies i enjoy  i m young and have my independence. i love all these things  and i generally love life in concept. why is it that  when you stack them up against the troubles facing the world right now  they don t act as a counter for depression   i feel guilty taking these things for granted and i often feel undeserving of them. the world is scary  it seems like more and more we re leaning towards right wing  xenophobic ideals as a society and it s genuinely scary as fuck. sometimes i just want to scream  why doesn t anyone care about global warming  why doesn t anyone care about each other  why do people only care about money    i ascribe a lot of my depression and anxiety to my job but i am finding it impossible to obtain new work  it s especially jarring as i am university educated. i don t look down on people who do the job i do but it is not the job for me and it makes me depressed.  my sleeping pattern is screwed  mostly because of that job having unsociable hours and partly because i covet my  downtime  so intensely that i will sacrifice sleep for it.  i ve never attempted suicide  but i have thought i d be better off dead. the reason i couldn t take my life is because i wouldn t want to have that negative an impact on the people around me  and also i want to play cyberpunk  but it s not because i value my life in any respect.   what do i do  is the world really as shit as i make it out to be  how do i be successful and get a job with a salary and which utilises my degree  how do i stop feeling sad    i m sorry for ranting,2020-10-06 10:07:55
162884,i need help. i don t know how to ask for it. i have tried many times  but lets be honest  mental health issues make most people uncomfortable and they don t know how to respond. at least that is my experience.   i m feel i am at a dead end.  i don t want to pay someone to pretend to give a shit. i can t afford to anyway.  i don t know what to say  or share.  i don t talk in regards to myself.   i m just so tired but it s never quiet.  i am not suicidal.  i ve attempted in the past and still have thoughts. have good days  amp  bad days. however  i am more or less in control of it now. after fighting with it for so many years. i have noticed when i get my period it gets really hard to keep that shit at bay though.  not sure what i m looking for. maybe i just wanted someone to know i guess,2021-09-03 06:57:29

59806,i think i m seriously done with life and i m looking forward to doing it. the world we live in is already hell. we are all divided and it seems like it gets worst. what s so wrong with a different skin color  or any race at least. everybody argues and never come to together. seeing this hurts because my life is also falling apart. i have high expectations that i probably won t get to fulfill. school is another waste of time. and adults these days blame technology for everything instead of moving forward. they think it s the root of depression or anxiety. truth is none of those are true. we all have to realize it s a way to view what s going on and a way to communicate. it s not the technology but what we do with it. i m too different i want to be in a relationship but i also don t  i just want to be unbothered the rest of my life. i have heavy anxiety and depression maybe it s not the technology it s the school system and the parents that expect so much from us. this world needs to change. before you know it we will have ourselves extinct by our own cause. the people of back then misunderstand a lot of things nowadays. this new generation might not be the best but we are also the most open minded. nobody is probably gonna read this but i hope it relates to you. stop the racism it s stupid fighting over a color or a race we look stupid as fuck doing this. i hope everyone finds a good life. my faith in humanity will never come back. we might have a brain and know how to use it. but animals that can t do what we do seem better then us. and also just tell the school system stop teaching worthless shit  i learn more here then there. i just wish for peace and unity.  p,2020-08-27 18:40:20

253,in our day and age with increasing reliance on using plastic rather than cash  there is an abundance of opportunities for bad people to steal your information money.  i started keeping all my receipts a number of years ago  at first to keep track of my expenses but i found many other advantages to keeping receipts    tracking expenses prevent fraud   backtracking in case of lost items   taxes taxes taxes  you have no idea how much you can write off if you have the receipts   and this is a big one you d never think of until it s too late  an alibi. if someone accuses you of a crime and your only alibi is the pizza delivery person you better have some tangible proof other than trying to track down the person and hoping they remember you.,2021-02-14 04:59:52
88886,i was doing really really well for about a month.  i applied myself at school and got some good grades. i practised bass for an hour every day  only skipping that very rarely. i studied every day  stretched every night and exercised  made my bed every morning and applied to a bunch of extracurriculars. i talked to friends and began reading again  i haven t been able to concentrate on that in years   only now i m slipping again and i don t know how to stop it or what to do.  i woke up a week ago in that depressed state again. i got a lower grade on a paper and the perfectionist in me is absolutely devastated. i don t have the energy or motivation to study and i can barely pick up my bass for more than 5 minutes without wanting to cry in frustration because i can t do anything and i m awful at everything. i can t focus and i m spending hours staring at the wall  or just laying down with my eyes closed thinking nothing  feeling so sapped and like i m staring up from the bottom of a well.  it s not fair because that one month of doing well when i usually consistently do like shit has made this even worse. the things i signed up for are actually happening soon  i ve been accepted  and i don t even feel happy. just dreading them because i d rather lay in bed doing literally nothing all day. while before i was so so excited. i can t bring myself to do any of the very urgent work i have to do and i m low key suicidal.   why was i suddenly okay  i don t know. i don t know what happened but something snapped again.,2020-12-10 06:33:32
12003,we use our kettle to heat water multiple times a day  every day. calcium from the water builds up into a flaky  milky white coating on the inside of the kettle. the best way to remove this is to leave vinegar soaking in the kettle for a while.   but sometimes i want hot water  now  and i don t want to wait for the vinegar method. i ve found that my silicone scraper  for scraping batter out of bowls  etc.  does a good job of quickly clearing off the majority of the residue  allowing me to put off the vinegar soak a little longer. it s actually much more effective than scrubbing it with soap.,2022-01-22 13:42:50

2221,they will stay ripe much longer  otherwise they usually get mushy in a couple days. the fridge does make the peels turn brown but they will stay good for much longer regardless. solves the problem of buying a bunch of unripe bananas and waiting for them to ripen then not being able to finish them before they get mushy.,2021-05-02 14:23:03

17257,suicide isn t a new concept to me  i ve been fantasizing it since i was twelve  trying to suffocate myself under my thick comforters as i resent my family for falling apart.   they were and are the only thing i care for. i partially raised my four younger siblings after my father broke my moms face  headbutting her multiple times in front all his kids  haven t seen him since i was 11.   i had this dream recently  my mom stared at me with a blank disappointed look as i held a knife to my throat. i was trying to convince her i was serious  but she didn t react at all. i stabbed myself and woke up sobbing with the realization that i m actually suicidal. alcoholism took my relationship with my mother away at an early age. i wish things got better after we left our piece of shit dad but our family seems to attract the worst people.   i ve given sold everything i ve had to keep us afloat  forget losing my virginity  i m years behind. i ve never owned a phone  car  or even a nice pair of shoes. i dress like trash and everything i m given gets pawned off eventually. i dropped out at 15  everyone says i m a genius  i had a very bright future  at 18 years old i still share a room with two kids  broke as ever. it s pathetic.    even if i could find resolve in all my bullshit  my mothers poor health will always haunt me. when i was 15 i found out she had cancer that since went into remission  she was diagnosed with pancreatitis when i was 17  and now recently diagnosed as diabetic. i pray she makes it another 10 years at least  i fear her disease could take her any day. i would blame myself endlessly if she didn t get to grow old. i ve tried to make her quit drinking and smoking. the amount of fear and stress i try to bury from these thoughts is by far the worst pain i ve ever had. i don t talk to others about these things and i try to keep it secret  at this point i have literally no one  i m just so fucking tired,2020-03-28 07:07:07
96144,i slowly fallen back into my depression. i ve noticed my mom get more irritable with me. even my therapist was concerned bc i couldn t stop crying our last session. idk how to tell my feelings anymore. i got pretty good at saying my feelings. and leaning on people. i went out 2 days in a row  which was irresponsible i know. but. it made me distract myself from my brain a little. felt nice just talking to friends  and forgetting what it is like to be cramped in a room. now in new year s eve. idk. all i want to do is sleep. i feel the need to die again. the thought that escaped my brain for months now crept back in and it s haunting me. i know dying isn t good. but i just wish i was better. i wish i was a better person overall. i wish my life was good. i wish there were no conflicts. i wish i could be hugged and told i m ok. i wish i could be happy. i wish i wanted to get up and do school. and walk my dog  and eat and take care of myself like i should but i can t. bc i don t want to be alive  i m just so sad again. and i don t know what to do with myself. i feel like all i do is make people worry. i don t know what i need or want anymore. i want to sleep. just keep sleeping and sleeping. and sleep,2020-12-31 16:29:53
127382,for years now  therapists  councillors  friends have all given the same damn answer to my depression   mindfulness    right off the bat  i just want to say it doesn t cut it for me. i know it can really help other people  benefit them or calm them but for me  it really doesn t do anything. in all honesty  i find it boring  belittling and stressful. i have told all these people who recommend mindfulness that i don t like it and it doesn t do it for me  but yet for some reason  they think if they are the ones to recommend mindfulness no matter my pleas  it ll somehow work. so i ve figured out i need a new tactic  i can t just deny mindfulness apparently  so instead i have to replace it with something. you know what does work for me  asmr. i love that shit. it soothes me  it relaxes me  it gets me to register detail in sound and touch and just gives me sensory awareness yet... bliss.   so here is the million dollar question. can i replace mindfulness with asmr  idk if this method is compatible  or worth putting forward to my therapist   who is a yoga  mindfulness addict       tldr  mindfulness doesn t work for me  asmr does  can i do that instead ,2021-05-01 12:45:28
510,mind and awareness are like water and ice.  ice is none other than water and water is none other than ice. not two things  but one.   mind is not awareness being deluded.  minds nature  when realised  is none other than awareness.  although mind and awareness are different in a sense  they cannot be distinguished by the analytic reasoning.  one day  as your confidence in a awareness grows  mind will appear as witless as a child.  awareness  as wise as a venerable old sage.  awareness will not run after mind  but eclipse it. in a relaxed serene state.  rest at ease.,2021-02-24 04:11:40

6066,she s my best friend in fact. she s just been getting irritated with me because i hangout with my other friends sometimes. i happen to be her only best friend in our town. she s always working  or going to school. she works full time during the week  and she s free on weekends  but sometimes she s doing homework. i also work full time during the week and but on the weekends sometimes i work both days as half days  or just one full day and off the next. so it s hard to try and meet with her i feel like since our schedules are very different. but since i don t know her schedule  when my other friends ask me to do something i say yes. but then she gets mad at me for not making time for her. mind you  she cancelled on me the last four times we were supposed to hangout. due to school or because she s tired and i m fine with that. on my end it s okay because when i do see her i feel like we pick up on where we left off. but for her she always tells me that she s irritated when i hangout with someone else and it s to the point where sometimes i don t want to post on my ig story when i m with my other friends so she doesn t feel bad. but it all goes back to me being her only friend  and she tells me it s not just because of the fact that our schedules are off it s because i make more effort to see other people instead of her even thought i knew her longer. i m just frustrated because that s not my intentions. any advice would be greatly appreciated.,2021-09-15 05:26:24
5900,i spent some time today googling meditation retreat centers in the tri state area. i am open to mostly anything  but would prefer a theravada based center  a jhana retreat  or a vipassana retreat. does anyone have good experience with any centers in this area   the ones i found that look promising are empty cloud  dharma drum  and bodhi monastery.  empty cloud is not doing in person retreats because of covid. bodhi monastery hasn t had a retreat on their schedule since 2020. dharma drum has a retreat in february.  many thanks,2021-12-30 19:15:26
107510,long story short. most people i ve encountered use  deceive  hurt deeply  annoy  enrage etc me to the point that i wish i would just die not to have to deal with anyone. i fake everything with everyone in my life as i have become very good at it. i just don t want to have to deal with people at all anymore period good or bad.    i have a girlfriend and parents and i don t give a fuck about how they would feel if i blew my brains out. i want to do it in front of them to make it sting more. i am a very morbid person who is a gemini and i often struggle with myself trying to make an attempt to ride this shit show of a life i have out.   i just don t know what to do anymore. i use to find solace and energy in solitude. i used to be an outgoing person who usually tried to see past the negative in people. now i only see red. all the things i used to do for   fun  play video games watch youtube or movies.....all of that is straight bullshit now. i do it out of habit and no longer because of enjoyment.  i deal with people i want to explode on everyday and i am able to control it for now but i don t know how much longer i have before i break and hurt someone else or myself. i m struggling to find space for myself but longing for companionship and it is a vicious cycle that has led me to not even knowing or remembering what true joy feels like. i am a shell of my former self. brittle and hollow.,2021-02-03 19:13:08

6709,whether it be which level of the parking garage or the intersection  street signs  of where you exit the parking garage. this can remove a lot of frustration  amp  stress depending on how many parking garages are in the area. it s easy to be excited  amp  you can t wait till you get to the beach. but i can speak from personal experience i was so excited i forgot what level i was parked on  amp  couldn t remember which parking garage it was. luckily i randomly took a picture of a building close to the parking garage  amp  it had a street sign in it so i was able to zone in on the location. if it had not been for that i would ve been walking around for awhile. parking garage was only 4 levels so not as much walking to figure that out.   it also can be beneficial to look back at your pictures sometimes to find out where you were at a certain time or where you were in general. a place like nyc can so big to visit you ll never remember you were in a certain area but by looking at pictures you ll realize you were in a certain place.,2021-08-30 14:26:24

1715,the codes work on the quantum level hence why they are so effective. as with all  energetic healing  https   youtu.be pc2rehhbdga   the power comes from your intent and opening your heart to receive the  love held in the universe. practice the codes when you feel strong to  activate your personal healing power so you can pull from that reservoir  when you are emotionally or physically drained. in this way you will be  taking responsibility for your own self healing for that is where all  healing lies.       how to use the healing codes  the spaces  between the numbers are important be sure to copy them exactly as  written for them to work. there are three ways to use the codes     the spaces between the numbers are part of the code  do not omit them.   copy and use the numbers exactly as written to active their power   placing  the codes in the energy field of the body is all that is required  they  do not need to be in the exact part of the body that holds discomfort.      write the codes in the air  big or small  you decide      write the codes on a note  place it in your pocket  purse  or under your pillow      draw the codes with your finger on your body.   relax  you cannot do this wrong. love and the power of your intent are controlling the outcome.  it  is your practice  skill  desire  intent  and trust that will make the  difference in the healing going from them through you and your aura to  help what you desire to be fixed.  there is also a powerful  influence of the energies that are on gaia at this time  they have not  been this high since the days of atlantis and lemuria think of it as an   energy soup  which provides the essential healing energy for these  codes to work  too. the higher the vibration  the better these codes are  going to work  in every way.  follow this meditation  https   youtu.be 6iigeywk3f0  to fully sense and feel this energy.      can  the healing codes be combined or repeated   yes. there is no harm in mixing these codes. they can be used as often as desired to achieve the result you seek.      what if the healing codes don t appear to work   similar to reiki  energy healing can take place on deeper levels than what meets the eye.  illness is the result of an energy imbalance that is very difficult for  most people besides psychic healers  to see. when the imbalance is not corrected  it manifests in the  physical mental or emotional body. so remember when you are using energy  medicine  the healing goes to both the underlying energy imbalance and  the physical. sometimes the physical heals first  other times new  perceptions to old problems come to mind which allow the healing to  occur on a deeper level. . either way  healing is happening  trust in  it.   amp  x200b    click here if you want to manifest miracles  https   www.youtube.com playlist list plxbafk6y5ygwogxydkemt2l1ei2nivif6 ,2021-05-04 19:19:16
184759,the worst part about being depressed is that negative thoughts literally consume your mind during every waking moment. i just wish there was someone who understood the extent of the constant emotional pain i feel.   i try to look happy for my friends and boyfriend but there are some days i can t pretend. i feel bad because i m always like this. there s always something making me sad and there s always some part of my body that i despise.  i know people are tired of hearing about how depressed i am. they might not say it but i fucking know that they must be annoyed and think that i m an emotional burden.   why can t i just be happy  what did i do deserve constant emotional and mental pain for the past 10 years of my life  i lose hope of ever recovering every day.,2021-11-19 18:39:47

4522,whenever i try to do sitting breathing mediation my heart becomes more present and faster and heavier than usual. even usually i m pretty aware of it. i need to quit cannabis and start meditating to achieve that level of nerve calmness without smoking but whenever i quit and start meditating it just seems like i m purposefully conjuring up a heart attack.  anything appreciated. i m clearly not trying too hard but it just seems like what s the point.  cheers,2021-10-02 09:51:07
4511,sitting with hips at 90 degrees means the puborectalis muscle is not relaxed  which means the kink in the upper rectum does not straighten out. raising the feet  so that the hips are flexed beyond 90 degrees straightens out where the colon and rectum join and allows poo to pass more easily  certain products can lift  elevate  and angle your legs when you use the toilet. this category of products  called potty stools  can put the body in an ideal position for pooping. potty stools are simple to use and relatively affordable.,2021-07-03 06:19:38
5023,understanding where these feelings come from  and just the vast complexity in which they ve formed is amazing.   letting things in this exact moment be as they are  and seeing them as they are rather than just reacting to discomfort. being on the verge of tears  but not crying. not because of suppressing any feeling. it s just the knowledge of it all  and being able to witness the sensations themselves without feeding similar past emotions into them has stopped any tears form fully forming.   tears are also welcome to come if they do find their way out though. i remember the last time i actually cried  during a meditation session  and witnessed the sensation of my tears. they released a stinging sensation upon the lines they left when i didn t wipe them away.  my sadness is free to express itself as the sensation it is  the only time it can do such a thing is in this moment. i may be feeling sad  but it s also mixed with happiness due to how i ve learned to perceive these sensations. happiness is a sensation i m much more familiar with than not  but it also can only live in this exact moment. perhaps i ll call it saddiness  but that s me just being silly.   the only point i m really making is   see things as they really are objectively and you ll be just fine. you will be able to make logical decisions rather than just reactions. understand your sadness will fade and you ll feel different sensations once it does. only time will tell what you ll be perceiving next.  as with anything on this sub  don t just take my word for it. your perceptions are only perceived after you ve realized them for yourself. be free and observant.,2021-11-02 20:57:59
187571,i am a limerent  in my case my limerence is characterized by a constant and intense need to be loved  it never goes away.  and i become quickly attached to a very handful of guys throughout my history  but those very few men have one thing in common i need to have sex with them in order to have feelings for them. it would depend on various factors  on how good looking they are  how old they are   how they respect and amplify my feminity  and how great they are in bed.  i m 31 now i had sex with more than 500 guys but i had gigantic crushes on only 6 guys 2 french  1 belgian  2 brit and 1 domican . 5 of them were white older than me and in my idea world husband materials.   the last one was a british  i only had sex one time with him but it was more intense than anything i ever felt in bed  it was during the last summer. and since then i never had sex.   i am seeing a therapist  i think she doesn t even have a proper answer to my situation but she s very good and i like her  that s why i keep seeing her.  now i m afraid to have sex  i have deleted all the apps on my phone. i m torturing myself to do not want to have sex  maybe next year or in 2 i might find someone who might fulfill my sexual desires and i might go back to the same rabbit hole again. i ve been on medication for depression for almost a year now  it s killing me inside.   i m thorn between wanting sex and also afraid to meet someone i might truly like. from all the 6 guys i had crush on only one saw me enough for a long term  the other 4  i was just a toy for them to be used even if they were good at giving me what i partially want.   i don t know what to do anymore. should i put an end to my sexual life or should i take meds to make me not having sexual desires at all to end my misery.  and once i become attached to a guy it would usually take me 1 year to get over him until i find another one who would make me feel happier. so basically i ve been on and off depression for 11 years now,2021-11-29 17:54:10
7231,kind of a vent ig   this has happened so many times and it s infuriating. since we re in quarantine it makes it so much harder for us to communicate. i mean even before quarantine started  everytime me and my other friend tried to make plans with this friend  she d always be the one to say  i can t because my parents said no  i mean she s nearly 17 and her parents have so much control and sometimes it s just so annoying i can t go out and hangout with my friends like other people because of this. once my stepmother even joked that i should stop being friends with her because she can t even make it to a sleepover. i m trying so hard soo hard to be understanding  but it s really difficult when she keeps constantly changing plans last minute  im curious how my other friend takes it so well. anyways  you don t have to comment or anything  i just needed to let this out.,2021-10-16 05:56:18
2029,i have always meditated trying to concentrate on my breath which is a great technique but i found another way that suits me better  i wanted to share it with you. with a focus on breathing i was often lost in my thoughts  space and time  sometimes i was distracted by it so much. what helped me focus easier i took from the last episode of   the midnight gospel  . deneen fendig gave a great advice on how you can redirect your consciousness from your mind head to another part of your body  she said to try to sense the inside of your hand  you can start just from one finger  just sense how it feels inside of it  under the skin  then you can sense 2 fingers  more and more fingers  your whole hand  then 2 hands and the whole body by slowly redirecting consciousness to the sensations of the inside of our body. i immediately tried this and had the most soothing transition to a meditative state. my thoughts no longer captured me in the future or past  they just came and went. i felt my whole body so warm and so relaxed by doing this. what techniques do you use to avoid getting stuck in space and time ,2021-05-18 11:00:25
123518,it sucks. i take like 2 hour long lunches so then i have to stay late just to meet my weekly hours. then i still don t focus for most of the time so i have to stay even later because i can t show up to the daily status meeting and tell everyone i finished essentially nothing. most days i log off around 8 9pm.   i logged off friday at 8pm telling myself i would jump back on sometime over the weekend when i was feeling better. well it s sunday at 11pm now and i never logged back on. but omg i did almost nothing on friday and i ve already logged so much work on this task i can t afford to drag this out any longer. so now i m torturing myself trying to make myself sit down and do it. and no i won t wake up early and do it. most likely i ll wake up as late as possible and make it to the status meeting late. i just can t deal with work anymore.,2021-04-18 23:12:44
140232,i want counseling because i feel alone and don t trust myself to set healthy expectations for myself  i m impulsive and it s blocking any positive momentum that i sometimes gain. since graduating college and entering the workforce  i have felt very stressed and apathetic towards work. i feel financially  socially  vocationally  emotionally  and physically stuck with my lot in life. coupled with this apathetic feeling towards life and existential  nihilistic outlook  i am not content.  i think i have commitment issues  deep rooted. whether it be tied to my personality  intp  5w4 sp sx   life philosophy  or the times we find ourselves in  i see both benefit and cost of every decision i can make. it might that i unconsciously look and find reasons not to do something or strive for something   i don t know if that is something i could fix  or if it should be fixed.  i see branching perspectives  outlooks  career choices  social causes  political and ideological identities and it seems incomplete to restrict myself to such a narrow identity. i guess deciding on what my identity is or will be in my life is an important factor of why i m seeking help. but in the words of the great exurb1a   you re going to have to decide whether you believe in god or want to eat meat or support abortion or feel that life has intrinsic meaning and whatever you do people  will shit on your opinions and tell you you re delusional.  really  maybe i m seeding a existential dilemma for myself. after a while of this toying with my sense of reality it really is enticing to question my identifiable characteristics    my personality  my experience  my life. i don t know what to do  i m tired of this and having this discussion with myself is nigh on insanity.  i don t know what i expect from therapy. i don t think i am normally very good at comforting myself in opposition to negative thoughts  at least i hope these sessions help this in some way  i don t know if there is something else i should be hoping for. now gosh  i feel this immense dread for anyone reading this because you too are unable to escape this  but somehow you ve made it where you are  i just want to get somewhere  because i am not anywhere i want to be now.,2021-06-14 11:51:11
8920,this is a bit late  but i always notice jack o  lanterns going bad in peoples  yards throughout october. a rotten pumpkin is no fun to deal with.  unless you feel that you must have carved pumpkins  keeping them whole until just a few days before halloween will make sure you have nice crisp jack o  lanterns for the big day. keep in mind  though  that weather plays a big factor  too. another tip is that if you use electric lighting in them  you might be able to salvage them for cooking  assuming they re still sanitary.,2021-10-30 10:48:46
4347,in which way does buddhism and psychotherapy have the same gods in common  they clearly overlap in the wish to reduce suffering  while buddhism goes much deeper.    amp  x200b   i m wondering if it is possible that the buddhist ideas are comparable to psychotherapy  and if yes in which way    how do they differ  ,2021-09-21 10:11:01
99576,i honestly don t see any upsides to anything anymore. the past two years reprogrammed all of my brain so that any positive thoughts i ve ever had have completely left me. i was in a mental hospital twice in the past few months and that didn t help  diagnosis and meds didn t help  talking to friends made it worse and talking to my counsellor doesn t change anything.  if i could see myself being happy in the future then this would all be chill and fine and just my run of the mill depression  but i genuinely don t see myself getting better anytime in the future so i guess i just don t see the point anymore. i don t even really see myself having a future considering i haven t had a real job in almost a year and the college degree i received two years ago i ve decided is useless. there s nothing about me that points to me ever being enough or being happy or even just being content.  i don t want to be depressed anymore and i don t want to have to pretend like i can do anything other than lay in bed and go to my doctor appointments. i don t want to have to pretend like i don t have anxiety attacks every time i leave my house because my mother wants to have dinner with me and won t take no as an answer.  i want to be better or i want to be left alone by the people who make everything worse and i really don t see either of those options happening. my brain just fucking sucks and i m the unlucky sad sap who s stuck with it.,2021-01-10 04:31:04
6060,i went through a super hard december and lost control so many times  and stoped meditating and taking care of my mental health.  i decided this new year   this january  to take responsibility for my own well being and make the changes i ve been talking about for years  mostly sobriety . and pretty much around new year s day i stumbled upon sam harris on youtube  and i m so glad i did. i eagerly listened to his appearances on rogan and started listening to his podcast and immediately downloaded his meditation app waking up. and i got to say this is the best meditation that i ve used. most are good   i still use insight timer     but i love the sound of sam s voice and i love the theory he puts with it. i don t want to say it changed my life yet cus it s only been five days  but i strongly feel it has the potential too. i feel like this is what i ve been looking for as far as learning a deep understanding of mediation and a full explanation and practice of a variety of techniques. i just wanted to share my rewarding experience so far and just say i strongly recommend the waking up app for anyone that needs a little help getting back on track with their daily practice. i now have a new understanding  new expectations for meditation  and overall feel way more hopeful about life.,2022-01-08 17:21:02

176251,i don t really know if this is the right sub but i am just sad and i feel so alone. i have been battling depression since i was 14 and some days are good some like today i just can t stop crying. i have friends but i never want to bother them with how i feel. i know it is too much and i can t put that burden on them. i m married and when i married my husband i thought i was marrying someone who understood how i felt and how some days are just bad ones. but it seems like lately  all he does is get mad at me when i am feeling down. he keeps telling me it s too much and he can t handle all my feelings. but i can t handle them either that s why i need support. i am just left feeling like a burden.  i don t want to feel like this. i want to have good days but i can t pull myself out of this pit. i want to be a good wife but some days it s hard to make myself clean the house or take adequate care of our dog or make it to the grocery store. when i am feeling down i pull away from everyone and all i want to do is lay in bed or in the shower. but as i lay in my self pitty all i can think about is i wish my husband was here to comfort me. but he won t he never does. that s all i want  to feel comforted by the man i love most but all i feel like when i m sad is that i m so broken no one can ever fix me. i know it s just my depression talking but it s the only voice i hear. i wish i wasn t so alone and sad all the time. i know it can be draining but it hurts me too. i just want to be good enough and i feel like i never will be. the littlest things can send me into a spiral of just toxic thoughts. a small fight with my husband can lead to an entire night of just crying. all i ever want is to lay in my bed and just exist. i don t want to leave this world yet because i know it gets better and that it is just a rough day. but it s just getting harder to pick myself up. i m losing the motivation to do that. i wish i wasn t but sometimes it just feels like it would be easier for everyone if i just ran away so i don t burden anyone else. i just want to be happy and i feel like that will never happen. my job has less meaning to me now i don t really care about it anymore and i just want to be at home and stay away from everyone so i don t make their lives any harder. i don t feel like myself anymore but when i think about it i have no idea who i am. i am just a wife with a meaningless job. i don t have dreams or ambitions i just exist. all i ever have wanted in my life was to be a mom but the idea of having a baby terrifies me. what if i pass depression on to my baby  what if i m not a good mom  what if postpartum depression just absolutely wrecks me  what if i can t care for my baby because i am too depressed to get out of bed. i  just don t know how to stop the spiraling of my depression thoughts. i just want to feel okay and i don t know how. i m sorry this turned into a long rant but it feels better to get this off my chest. i know things will get better and i just have to fight through it i am just so tired. thanks for listening.,2021-10-21 21:45:12
94866,why can t i have a break  in a matter of months i lost my house  my girlfriend  my friends and had to move back to place where i don t know anyone  god.   i feel so lonely  days are long i barely leave my grandma s house  i got no friends and no lomger i can t even look myself in the mirror all i see is just a stranger standing there  i wish i could go back.  gained weight and lost that weight  i m pale  my hair falls out  i no longer have a clean face nor my smile is what it used to be  i haven t felt good in years and some days i can t even get out of bed and other i just feel mad  i sometimes hate everyone my feelings went numb  my life as i knew ended in october 22 from 2018  things just seem to be getting worst since i m borderline broke and my father refused to help me  my ex keeps trying to push me to this point and i no longer think i m gonna be able to resist i feel nothing but sadness and anger  that s no way to live this is getting out of hand  wish me luck.,2020-12-27 23:38:34
188318,at the final subject of my  30m  studies  my professor  who loves to mention how discrimination is actually a good thing   i m a poc  screwed me over with bullshit reasons to give me a grade that s just low enough to block me out of graduating cum laude. i had spent two years of the prime of my life giving everything i have to pull this one thing off. skipping parties  staying very short if it s important enough  not spending as much time on my spouse or my job as i d want.   my professor wasn t even the teacher of that subject  he only graded the exams. the teacher is a coworker of mine and he agreed that i definitely should have gotten a higher grade after looking at my answers  but he wasn t willing to go against the professor. the professor has the final say  and that will be the case even if i go to some special committee to complain about my grade. i feel like i didn t fail  but i got robbed of a beautiful achievement and there s nothing that i can do about it.  this happened almost two years ago  around the same time that covid started locking everything down. the sun stopped shining for me. i spend my days waking up late  eating shit  sleeping irregular  stressing about whether i ll get fired from work or not. my work is very unsupportive and basically said the situation of my poor mental health is my fault. my wife doesn t love or care about me because since we got married because she s probably only using me for a residence permit. she gives me just enough crumbs of attention to keep me from divorcing her for now. i also have a smartphone addiction like everyone nowadays.  everything is going down for me  harder and faster day by day. i ve started fantasizing about eating a double barrel shotgun again. not that i d ever be able to do it  but in a way that a kid might joyfully daydream about something nice and impossible. i ve been dreaming about eating guns since age 14  when i discovered that i m not a normal straight guy. i had to repress  and still do  to please the closed minded people that are everywhere in my life  but after about 8 years of hating yourself  you kind of become numb to self hatred and it becomes bearable.  sometimes  i feel like there s hope. and i feel okay for a few days. usually doesn t last a week. and then it s back to a month or two of lifeless depression. i saw a therapist earlier this year and after a lot of information from me  her advice kind of boiled down to walk more  make lists and talk with your manager. we ended the meetings because i felt like i was paying a lot of money for no results.,2021-12-02 09:29:45

157514,i catfished a youtube chat for 9 months by pretending to be a 13 year old bisexual girl who was not accepted by her parents. i m actually a 13 year old bisexual girl who s parents don t know that i am bi. to feel better about myself after my  now ex  friend said that i m  just a waste of space  and a  mistake  i felt awful and i needed support from someone and compliments. my stupid 12 year old self used my main account that had my real usernames that my friends know belong to me. i feel awful and i don t know what to do. please help i don t know if i should come clean or let it be. telling them would get rid of the guilt and fear but they could react poorly and start a mob mentality or i could let it be and i wouldn t have to hurt these peoples feelings but i would still have the fear of being caught. i don t know what to do  i m just so afraid that the chat will find out and then my friends will find out then my friends wnd family will hate me.,2021-08-14 20:13:16
4828,if you re in a situation where you really need to fart but don t want to make a noise  like on a date or in a public place  find a space  bathroom or just walk away from other people for a moment   and spread your butt cheeks as wide as you can  and then let it go   it will emerge soundless. you will be amazed at how soundless.  if you re uncertain if it s a poop then maybe don t try this unless you re on a toilet.   unfortunately this trick can t help with the smell side of things but it was a saving grace in the early days of dating my partner. there was a lot of booze and late dinners that can make one a bit   gassy. funnily enough it was my partner who gave me this tip to begin with. five years on and we have only heard the other person fart once each thanks to this trick.  for those of you who don t believe in fart shaming or hiding   more power to you  some day i will be as evolved as you.,2021-07-12 09:49:52
2838, hey you   yes you  do you like having fun as a group  doing group events and voice chatting with multiple people    if you so this is then this the place for you    why don t you come along and join  you will fit right in and be welcomed with friendly people and greatness     i ve found that for me the easiest place to make friends is in a group setting bc you don t have to carry 50  of the conversation  you can pop in and out and things can still usually continue without you and there s not a lot of time for things to be awkward bc there are a few different people able to add input to the conversation  so if you are over 18 and under 30 why don t you come and join us and have a great time    we are sure you will enjoy it     message me for group link    also please introduce urself a lil bit like ur age and where ur from   a,2021-06-05 16:21:21
181,ok so i know this might be a gross topic but i think it needs to be said. anyone with a vagina or has discharge from somewhere into their underwear might appreciate this. i only recently tried this and it has been life changing.   when you throw underwear directly into the laundry basket  the fluid dries. that dry crust is really hard for the washer to remove. doesn t matter how great a washer you have  doesn t always get clean.   instead  if you clean it off when still wet  it comes off super easily with just some soap and quick scrub. then voil   clean underwear crotch every time.   p.s. in case it needs to be said  vaginal discharge is normal. however if the discharge looks or smells different than normal  please see a medical professional if possible.,2021-02-11 22:55:49
121931,i always wake feeling like please kill me but thats normal.   i hate the time period between 1pm to 3pm  the heat  the sun  everything feels unbearable. i cant explain exactly how i feel but its like it doesnt make sense to exist. everything seems worse  loneliness  anger  angst  and i wonder if someone relate.   i love raining. lets say if i wanted to kill myself right now and suddenly started raining i would stop everything and would play some random video game listening to the dark side of the moon. this is how much raining affects my mood,2021-04-09 12:15:24

60944,i have a life. i m alive and ya know  here. a family. a great boyfriend. all these things and yet i just have nobody. i don t have anyone to share my depression with. no way to lift this weight off my chest. i have no one. yet everyone  one should need. but i just  can t help feeling this immeasurable weight. i don t know what to do.    ,2020-08-31 23:36:43
193561,i feel like i have this massive weight on my shoulders  which consists of everything i have to do and i m fucking tired.  i ve been depressed for 6 years now and i don t know what normal feels like anymore. i hate how i have rare moments of optimism about the future and then the next day my brain decides to switch to thinking everything is shit and boring. i m sick of the notion that you should go to our friends for support when i know there s nothing they can do and there s nothing worse than knowing someone pities you. plus i dont want to be needy. i want to get rid of this loneliness  and i ve tried to make more friends  but it s so difficult acting like a normal human being when you don tfeel normal and every interaction is anxiety provoking. i ve had to stop clubbing since drinking is involved and nowadays drinking seems to make me suicidal. i m at the point now where i get anxious about the possibility of being anxious later on. i honestly just wish i could pause the world whenever things get too much. that s all for now,2021-12-22 20:41:34

802,by last year of academic phase   i mean like last year of elementary  last year of middle school  last year of hs. like you had the whole 3 years to find each other or be close but the last year is when it happens. i don t know how to make friends sooner rather than later  why is it taking me so long compared to others.  i never end up with anything.,2021-03-12 23:05:29
111234,so a few months ago i dumped the last group of friends i had because they were getting too hyper political and i just couldn t stand it anymore. i m just not that in to that stuff as much as others. but they saw it as abandoning them and possibly think i ve been  corrupted.  so now i have zero friends. i have family but it s usually a once a week or month thing. other than that it s work associates about work things.   i m ok with this............. but  i keep thinking about ape alone weak. i m at peace with being unwanted by women and being considered an eccentric by most but ape alone weak. i m going to need help. my family might be able to help some but not much.   ape alone weak  it s hard moving alone. if i want a big tv i have to pay best buy to help me mount it. if i need a second set of hands fixing my car instead of paying through the nose at a shop where do i... you get the point.   to be honest i m as happy and healthy as i ve ever been but should i trade some of that for a little insurance  apes together strong right ,2021-02-19 14:08:57

114668,hi community   i don t where to start but i m thirty and i think i ve been depressed in some form or the other for most of my life. i ve followed this thread in times of support  and i feel like it s a good time to reach out.   to start  i think my depression set in when my first dad passed away from cancer. i was seven at the time. i went through years of consoling and beat it for a while. i made friends  grew my life  went to collage  got a degree  found a passion in filmmaking and photography  as well as worked on various fulfilling projects. lots of time has passed since then and sometimes i was never depressed. it came and went.   things have changed since then. i lost my second dad to cancer last year on top of our new covid lifestyle. however  i still went in and out of depression.  now in the new year  i feel more depressed then ever. my job security is gone and i m grieving another loss. i feel like i have no direction. i try to work on my previous hobby s past times that i know will make me happy but i have trouble starting any of them.  i ve been trying to self coach myself out of this point in my depression as i ve done in other times. i m sure it s just a hard patch. but any support or advice would be great.,2021-03-04 22:47:07

68585,i saw a man today holding a gun up to his head  the pain in his eyes were indescribable. he was about to turn the gun on me before my friend floored it and we got out of there to the other side of the apartments. he was threatening to shoot other people earlier that day too. i am so shaken up by this and i ve never been in a situation like this before and i don t feel safe and i am very shaken up and sad about what happened. the man killed himself 20 minutes later and all i can think about is fleeing for our life and the pain i saw in his eyes. i heard the gunshot too. do i talk to a doctor and be honest and say that i m scared and sad and i ve been crying all day i don t know if i have ptsd or what is wrong with me i m only 19.   https   www.google.com amp s amp.marionstar.com amp 5872466002,2020-09-30 21:06:56

128464,i had this long post about my  journey   but i needed to remind myself that this post is for you  not me. you don t give a shit how i struggled  because you ve got your own struggles to deal with right now  and i completely understand that.   amp  x200b   i read through these posts and my heart breaks. people feeling unwanted  unloved  unaccepted by their family or society in general. i wish i could meet every single one of you and give you a hug.   amp  x200b   it needs to be said   you aren t weird. you aren t crazy. you aren t a burden. you aren t broken. most of all  you aren t alone  as much as you feel like it. you re just going through a shitty ass time  and life continually beats you down like an endless tidal wave. every day feels like you re walking through mud while wearing thousand pound shoes.   amp  x200b   focus on the little victories  i believe in you. i remember one day it took all of my will to just throw away the beer cans and fold the month s worth of clothes i had on the floor. in the end  i was still miserable as fuck  but at least i had a clean room haha. little victories.   amp  x200b   so often we suffer in silence  because we don t want to bother the ones who actually do care.  oh  they re busy with their own lives  i don t want to drag them down . fuck that. it took me far longer than i admit to actually reach out to a friend. they always ask  how are you    it s your responsibility to say  not real good man  would you mind talking  . it s scary as fuck  but i promise someone will listen. and it may not help immediately  but eventually something will click. even something as dumb as hitting up a homie with  hey  i m having a real bad day  can i just come by and hang out  . i can t possibly count the amount of times my buddy and i would just sit and play video games in absolute silence on my bad days. just having an ounce of normalcy  even for a moment  helped.    amp  x200b   i m rambling at this point  but i want every one of you to know that you aren t alone. you are loved. you will get through this  as impossible as it may seem. i promise. just focus on those little victories. lastly  reach out to us   this is a community and we all want to see each other thrive  not just merely survive.   amp  x200b   i love you all.,2021-05-04 22:47:21
287,i have tried buddhist meditation and mindfulness techniques and also paul brunton s meditation technique that he learnt from ramana maharshi. which would be better for me  i am attached to both methods but am also of an intellectual frame of mind and so have not progressed with mindfulness methods.,2021-02-15 04:41:10
90067,a year and a half ago  why couldn t i do a damn thing about my situation  was it that i couldn t find it in myself  ain t that a shame. it s alright to be ashamed of things every now and then. i m doing all i can to try to get over it. maybe my efforts won t matter. maybe i ll always be seen as that. mistake. that waste of space whose every dream and will was to not be like that. who can say if this next year will make up for all of that  it s not gonna be an easy ride  and it s not like i ve been asking for help. not that i deserve it  but wouldn t it be something if our disinterests don t align  if we could go our own ways  and forget about all of it  if it were actually better for me to set the example  give me the doubt of the benefit and leave me be  and maybe if things go my way  we can reconvene one way or another.,2020-12-13 18:43:20
3640,i really don t know if this question fits here but  at what age would it be appropriate to teach a child about awareness and that he s more than his body. the concept of the soul being who he is and the body is something temporary. and also  that he has a mind that can do tricks on him if he isn t careful about which thoughts he entertains    is it even something that a kid should know about or would it just complicate everything and make him self conscious ,2021-08-10 17:48:29
11437,just by making my girlfriend coffee  putting a glass of water next to her or making her a little snack really puts a smile on her face. not to mention if i happen to got time on my hand and e.g. clean the windows.  just doing things even if they are chores but   without being asked to do them   shows others multipile things    you do something without others reminding you   you like love others and show that by valueing their time   you think about them and also put your thoughts into action  i know this is simple and many of you will already know this but for those of you who don t  just by going one extra step each day and making your parents coffee  bringing the trash out for your siblings or doing the laundry for your so will improve their lives and mood while also making you feel great ,2022-01-07 02:23:11
3316,just like people have been blocking automatic updates on windows for decades  i advise people to block updates on their phones too. it s never about  security . it s always about slowing your phone s interface and battery step by step and then after a few years  they deliver the knockout punch  which causes your battery to drain within 2 hours.  do the same for apps too  and only update the ones which don t let you open them without updating. for laptops  don t do bios updates  that ll slow your batteries down even faster.,2021-05-31 12:52:28

131500,i ve gotten used to distract myself permanently for years so i don t get caught up in endless thought spirals...  i started with video games and self harm then drinking and smoking weed. and it came to a point where i feel addicted  not to something specific but i always have to distract myself with one or multiple of those things  today i had a pretty hefty hangover so i decided not to drink or smoke  lying in bed i don t play anything and i won t engage in anything else but instead of falling asleep since i m really really exhausted i get caught up in thoughts over thoughts over thoughts whenever i close my eyes...  the problem is i m not stupid and i know that continuing with games drugs sh etc will not help but actually make me worse long term... i just gave no idea what i can do i can t endure my thoughts i have no concept what i can do without considering things like suicide...,2021-05-14 20:00:15
1928,try to get some water loving plants to put outside. down here in florida it rains a lot sometimes. it s gray and wet for weeks and no changing the weather so it s easy to get things like seasonal depression or just down because of the weather. but having some plants outside like tomato s or something of the sort can help to change your mood.  1. one less day you have to water your plant 2. you can look outside and go  hey man  you re getting some free food and i get some free food from you getting free food.   3. a sense of accomplishment from virtually doing nothing.  it s not a complete cure but it s one of those things that helps make your world a little bigger and brighter.,2021-04-23 19:41:47
154734,so i ve always had a hard time making friends  i have a really close knit group i rely on and that s pretty much it. this friend of mine has been taking me out to meet her friends and i genuinely appreciated the gesture  it made me feel safe. however  she s been acting weird since then  joking about how i m  stealing her friends  or  leeching onto her  and i just can t seem to understand why she jokes about it even though she s the one to reach out most of the time. she suddenly stopped answering my texts until this morning  she said she s getting tired of hanging out with me. yet  4 hours later she asks me if i want to hang out. she s aware that i have depression and i don t want to victimize myself but it can be really hurtful to have these mixed signals thrown at me  especially because i don t have any friends to rely on. i ve been going out by myself and though i usually enjoy my own solitude i can t stop thinking about what i did wrong   any tips   tldr  my friend ghosts me but suddenly wants me to hang out again  and proceeds to say really hurtful things to me,2021-08-05 02:39:11
279,okay so for this entire day my friend has been going on how she can t be surprised of what i do  she lives like 650 km away from me so i asked  you wouldn t be surprised if i showed up at your door   she said  no  then i asked  if i sent you something nice  and again she said  no  then i went on and was like  if i produce a song for you   she once more said  no  so i am kinda stuck... me and her roommate kinda just agreed on  pranking  her in the way that we will pretend like something is gonna happen and we ask questions but nothing will happen we just  gather information  and then just one day randomly go boom surprise but i am still at loss cause i do not know how to surprise her   if someone has a good idea i could really use some advice ,2021-02-15 18:08:27
143212,does anyone else feel guilty about being depressed   i feel like i have no reason to be. i used to always blame it on my childhood. my dad was mentally abusive to me and my mom. but my mom was great. why should i be depressed about my childhood if i had a figure in it who was great to me. it s just me being selfish and thinking i deserve everyone to care about me.,2021-06-25 04:26:25
113671,being clinically depressed and anxious has made me lose all my friends and my best friend. i cannot take feeling this lonely anymore  i have no close or best friends right now or even anyone who texts me.  im self aware enough to know my depression. self isolating and anxieties has caused this but how the fuck did i fuck up my life this bad. i hate this stupid illness and i m afraid i m never going to have friends again  perhaps i m just terrible and worthless.  whenever i feel sad i just try to think of how lucky and blessed i am  but sometimes the fact that i m lucky makes me embarrassed that with all the privileged i still cant function or be happy.  sometimes i m hopeful but then i just remember that this feeling of crippling sadness creeps up on me no matter where i am or go.  i try to remain positive buy being lonely is getting tough.  i m 19  years old and feel like i have no value on this world anymore.  any advice or stories of overcoming something like the would help me so much thankyou,2021-02-27 05:12:52
92573,i am someone who has a lot of interests for a lot of things  piano  sports  cooking  baking etc.  and i realize that most of the things i do are for others in order to get recognition  oh  you re so good and smart etc.  and being apart of a community. i love meeting new people and get to know them and making friends. but i am rarely happy alone. this is why i ve never been in a relationship before since i m too desperate for one thinking that one would save me. why do i need the recognition of others and how can i teach myself the self love  how can i teach myself that i m enough already by myself  i m a fighter and i really want to learn,2020-12-21 02:14:32
2684,i just read the wikipedia article about mandalas and remembered something..  when i first started meditating close to 1.5 years ago  i had a visionary experience. i believe that i mediated for quite long for a newbie and was in a very sleepy   hypnogogic state due to my inexperience.  nevertheless  i clearly remember seeing certain shapes and symbols flash in my mind.  the first one  which was approaching me or i was approaching it  no idea what exactly happend   was some sort of an living  moving picture or thing  its  limbs  or parts were moving independently   that was shaped like a cross and had 4 swastikas on each quadrant with dots.. after that  mandalas of all shapes and weird sizes flashed non stop with incredible speed in my mind..  i remember i was surprised afterwards  i realized that most of the weird eastern art you see  are actually about these mental images one sees during meditation  i had no idea about  mandalas .  so.. whats the significance of these  are they somewhat pictorial representations of the structures of the subconscious mind  something sophisticated like that  or was i just imagining it   i need to say that i am not into mandalas  i dont know anything about them  the only thing i knew was the swastika and it had negative connotations to me due to our recent western past or whats being taught about it.. but later learnt its a good symbol  which was perverted  anyway...  has anyone else had similar visionary experiences  its very baffling that we have these things in our minds  which we usually see in the eastern world as paintings.. its especially prevalent in eastern  islamic countries.  im talking about things like this  for example  https   mandalaoftheday.files.wordpress.com 2015 10 2015 299 nasr al mulk.jpg  ...,2021-06-20 09:13:17
592,whenever my friends hang out near my house  they keep calling me asking for drinks  food  or to use a toilet. i know there are no stores near  and my other friends house  she usually calls  is like a half an hour away. they would never do that near their homes  other friends homes  etc.  when the stores there are closed  or it there aren t any. i m tired of feeling like a grocery store that gives things for free  and when i said no today they just hung up  and before that acted like i did something wrong.,2021-03-02 13:36:33
920,so i m a beginner  and i m reading about meditation. one common recommendation is to hold your hands in your lap  palms up with thumbs touching. it makes an oval  as if you are holding an egg. what i have noticed though  is that when i do this it is not a relaxed position for me. that is to say  it takes effort for me to keep me hands together. is that what it is like for a lot of people  i prefer to have my hands on top of my legs  as it takes less effort to hold my posture and also helps me sit up straighter that way.,2021-03-28 03:03:42
1012, it will be really tempting to buy a big  piece  to improve your look however buying a combination of good quality t shirts  trousers and socks is the most effective first step.  it means you will be able to mix and match these items and curate outfits for different occasions  dark coloured basics will generally always go together .,2021-03-16 07:25:23
6782,hey  i m at such a point in my life where i have some time to talk  but a lot of people who reply  seem to have normal busy lives  so it s difficult to bond  especially given the time difference.  i m looking for a fellow adult  who s open minded towards audio conversations  on an app . it could be entirely anonymous  no video   but i m sadly not huge on texting  hence my preference for voice  which i find to be a more human like medium and experience. i can understand obvious hesitance that some people could have  from my end i would do everything i could to preserve the sense of propriety and mutual respect.  general interests  literature  art history  philosophy  psychology  economics  languages  geography.  music  all over the place   seafret  m83  philip glass  lord huron  radiohead  sigur ros  mogwai  of monsters and men  yndi halda  god is an astronaut  godspeed you black emperor  keaton henson  laura marling  max richter  if these trees could talk  clint mansell  some songs of sia and adele  and many other artists. if you don t recognise some of those names  it could be a plus  because we could mutually enhance our preferences in music.  literature  non fiction  microhistory  biographies  geography and culture   fiction as in sci fi  mystery  thriller  subtle philosophical supernatural horror. i m more of a prose person  though i do appreciate some poetry from time to time. i might not be really refined for it  i find narratives extremely compelling  especially when it comes to crafting the story in a way that ensures the flow of events and miniscule details that are going to build up towards the resolution. i prefer contemporary prose  althought i have done my share of getting to know some crucial classics  mostly  western  sadly   both for school and out of my own curiousity. when it comes to psychology  my horizons were influenced partly by viktor frankl  erich fromm  rollo may  and some others who worked within the loosely defined existential school of thought. favourite philosophers  i haven t read a lot of primary sources  but i did find reading schopenhauer  sartre  camus  benatar  challenging  in a positive way . philosophically speaking  my interests concern mostly ethics and aesthetics. recently i ve developed a more nuanced perspective on merits of different approaches towards such topics as anti natalism and abortions debate  so if that interests you  we could discuss those.  movies and tv series  haven t seen one in a while  but i used to like black mirror  sherlock  house  futurama  elementary  and a few others. broadly speaking  i like film experience that attempts at focusing on complexity of human condition  that s why i tend to gravitate more towards philosophical films.  i watch quite a lot of youtube  educational  popular science channels  booktube  social commentary  some podcasts. i m quite fond of science communication in the fields of physics and biology.  a bit more about me  depression issues and anxiety  not really vehemently into intersectional social justice and a bit socially conservative  but i am not a bigot  i would never take into any kind of consideration your gender identity  race  etc.   do not play any videogames. i m a bit of a bookworm  and i tend to talk about lofty  ivory tower ideas  but some have told me that i do possess a sense of humour  which is probably amongst the most subjective types of assessments .  i suppose  i m looking for a person who also feels a tad lonely and in need of some emotional support. it d be great if we could stay in relatively frequent contact. i hope i do not sound very entitled  putting forward all these things about the  ideal  person to find on here. my rationale is that it might help to give others a perspective on how to structure potential connection  if any  depending on what you think  after finishing reading my post .  i ve posted this quite a few times  so my sincere apologies to the not first time readers.  thank you for reading this. feel free to pm me.,2021-10-03 23:35:06
6607,my mom would do this all the time when talking about people. she d say a name and i d ask who  but rather than telling me who they are  she d just say their name again.  chances are they heard you and know what you said but are confused  so rather than saying the exact thing you just said  add some context.  they could also have an auditory processing disorder  so it just takes them a little longer to hear what you said.,2021-08-27 17:26:50
144120,when i was taking my dog for a walk  i found an injured rabbit with flies swarming it. it was still breathing  so i ran inside to ask my parents what i should do. they said to not do anything  that it was too late to help it. so i had to just let it die  and i felt powerless to help it. now i feel like i have a death on my conscience  that i could have done something to help it  but i didn t. how do i deal with this ,2021-06-28 12:06:16
186506, basically this friend doesnt have the greatest parents either  but compared to mines hers are god like basically winning the jackpot of parents. she told me yk what when you finally get the job and apartment to move out you wont have to visit your parents since you parents were abusive enough we were having a convo where i was complaining where every other youtube video i watched on abusive parents didnt have a situation as bad as mine   she then went on to say  people like me with okish parents have it way harder   we didnt have it good and suffer with trauma but also our trauma wasnt as bad as yours to justify cutting off parents completely  this just was utterly gaslighting and i lost my shit. lol,2021-11-25 23:12:54

73312,why cant i do anything. i have so many goals for myself but i can t get to doing any of them  or if i do  i inevitably quit after a week or less. i m turning 18 in 3 days and i m so fucking done..there s too much going on in my life for me to handle and at the end of the day  i know i m just another person complaining. but i m tired. i have friends who ve been feeling the impact of self isolation throughout this whole catastrophe. i reassure them they re not alone and i try to be there for them cause i know it s tough. i feel like i m helping in some way maybe  but i m too afraid to open up to them too. i get in these moods where i feel really desolate and just find myself with this sinking feeling at any given moment. whether i m brushing my hair  putting on clothes  or just laying in bed like i am now. i feel like i m not doing enough and i m very much alone. i just cry in my bed. i don t want to be a failure. but i want to give up so bad. idk...i don t want to post this. i ll leave it here for like 10 minutes.,2020-10-19 00:02:39
99962,i don t feel like there s much meaning to my life anymore. i have a strained relationship with my family  the next person i love the most  my best friend and roommate  doesn t feel the same way i do. i go to work everyday and after almost 10 hours of travel and work  i m exhausted. i don t feel like i m cared for and i don t expect anyone else to when i can t even care for myself.   i m getting tired.  i keep seeing myself tidying my whole house up  leaving a little excess money for the rent and then chucking away all my things to leaving a simple note on the bed with  eh  just got tired of it all .  i don t feel loved  i don t feel cared for and the one person who would hug me and tell me she loves me in moments like this  is dead. i miss my mum and i want to go to her. i m really thinking that i just might.,2021-01-11 07:07:35
82261,i thought most people would relate to this but they don t.   does everyone else actually literally always do their best  what s wrong with me that i don t    i guess the confusing part for me is that it s not just one thing  or a couple things  i feel like it s everything. my lacking social skills  my slipping academic performance  my incompetence  my trouble with seemingly simple everyday things and life skills  my communication difficulties  my general lack of knowledge about world affairs  sports  and popular culture  my annoying verbal tics  my verbosity  my poor hygiene  my bad habits  my lying problem  my abuse of my prescription pills  my mental slowness  my  perceived  cognitive difficulties  my procrastination habits  my timidity diffidence hypersensitivity passivity  my relationship with my dad  my inexperience  my horrible sense of direction  working memory and problem solving  my badly bitten nails  my childishness  my proneness to infatuation  my weight  my  lack of  stable personal  style  fashion sense  my occasional arrogance  my false humility  my desperation and attention seeking impulses and behavior  my painting  my porn habit  my sex life and sexual history my entire personality ... it goes on and on. is it reasonable to expect improvement in all these areas  obviously it would be silly to try to learn a new instrument  a new language  and to take up surfing all in the same month and with the same intense focus but in terms of personality improvement  should i try to work on all aspects of my personality  at least as they come up    for instance  in a normal day  i am almost constantly noticing myself do things i know i should not or  after the fact  realizing i could should have done differently. so for instance i wake up and snooze the alarm a couple times instead of getting out of bed and going on a walk first thing which i know i should do. then i eat strawberries and coffee for breakfast and i know i should eat something else but i don t want to go upstairs because i don t want to talk to my grandmother which is not very nice of me   because she is my grandmother and letting me stay here in her basement  and she is lonely and i should talk to her  but i just don t feel like it  i m really really tired still and i just don t see anyone right now  but it has no rational basis and feeds into my avoidance and is overall slightly detrimental to me in the long run i.e. i don t get protein for breakfast and i don t feel good about myself for doing the right thing by chatting visiting with my grandma . instead  i do the  wrong  thing which is to not eat a bigger breakfast and avoid having to talk to grandmother.   this pattern of doing the wrong thing repeats itself 100s of times in a single day. by the end of the day  i can see all the ways in which i choose to do the easy but not as good thing. most people say they do their best every day  but i can tell you with certainty that i could almost always been better. i guess i don t understand the concept of always doing ones best  or how others manage to do it.   i mean  admittedly  i sometimes do do the  better  thing instead of the  worse  thing sometimes  but it doesn t cancel out all the times i did not do my best and in fact consciously did much less my best because it was easier  as in snoozing the alarm .   so in terms of improving what does that mean  really  when you make thousands of small decisions about how to behave every day    what if between those moments maybe you did consciously do the  right  thing many times and it was hard and you are improving. you can t say you really did your best can you    at one point does it become doing your best  and if you aren t doing your best that s not okay  correct  but isn t pretty much all of your behavior  including how you deal with your thoughts  in your control  so doesn t that mean behaving nearly perfectly  at least in accordance with what that person believes to be the good and perfect  the only way to do ones best ,2020-11-20 23:03:35
9366,city  country  suburbs  how do you like to get out to meet people    i used to meet most the people i knew from college or at a climbing gym. i ve been out of school for a bit now just working  and off work from a knee surgery  so not much meeting new people. the people i tend to meet at work are much over my age  21 . trying to find inspiration through what you guys do,2021-12-09 11:50:09
183718,im 23 and i talked to this girl online for a few days she is from my city we talked for about 6 days and today we met for the first time i really thought i liked her and was interested in her she wanted a real and enduring relationship just like i do and today it felt fine we kissed and cuddled  til a point where she obligated me  pretty much ordered me to delete all pics with my ex gf a girl i was with for almost 2 years i deleted about 2 or 3 pics but my heart melted a bit doing it i couldnt find a way to delete all plus there were many on facebook and all and she was lik fine you gotta delete them all when you get home though . when i got home she started acting angry and bossy and almost threw a tantrum i still had pics with my ex and she again ordered me to delete them when i tried doing it i started crying as even though we had bad moments i had great ones too and it was a good part of my life that lasted for quite a while and i was supposed to delete and forget all of that over a girl i spend only 2 hours with   besides this a day before this date of mine got angry at me that i fell asleep as i was talking to her as i had been on the phone texting her for those 6 days almost non stop and barely had sleep and she got angry at that too. for the simple fact my body couldnt keep me awake anymore i decided i dont want this and she almost made me miss my ex with this attitude as she would have done something like this if it hurt me did i do something wrong not wanting to talk to this girl again ,2021-11-16 00:13:19
10102,i might be talking to my self but thought if i just started talking then maybe i might get a conversation going....  when i was eleven i was extremely lucky to be taken to disneyland paris. my mum had started saving up the moment she knew she was having me because it was her dream to go and she knew she wanted to take me with her. we saw disney s musical version of lion king and i was blown away. absolutely beautiful show. what s your favourite musical or theater production   well my goal this new year is to experience more and travel more. so i found in birmingham they are showing disney s beauty and the beast. i had to get tickets  so i m going to see that in march  so excited. what are you excited for   what are your goals this year ,2021-12-28 09:30:25
161929,i have never posted here  guess you could say i m a lurker.  like many others i never thought i deserved to take away from their  spotlight  i guess. like it was selfish for me to think i had it bad when i know others have it worse.   it seems like a lot of people go from sorrow to emptiness  i kinda did the opposite and i am sure this is more natural than i think but now it s like i don t know how to handle it.   same old shit  fucked up childhood  fucked family  shitty ex girlfriend who said i abused her 8 months after leaving me for a coworker of mine. lost family and friends alike. even had to see a detective about it.   no physical abuse but lots and lots of mental stuff. from both my mother and that girlfriend. don t talk to a big portion of my family now. only just recently started seeing my dad again. not because he did anything wrong really but i closed everything off  and everyone.   i had to move out  i had no money. so i ended up having to max out my credit card just to survive  car broke down shortly after  now i needed a car. more debt.  i became reckless  i used to be great at saving money but when your money just goes to making someone else rich while you struggle to pay for food  i want something for myself sometimes damnit.   that was 7 years ago. now i still have the debt of a broken man  physically in a better place  and realistically mentally too but not by much. i don t get into a car or walk into a building and imagine all the different ways i could kill myself in there  at least not as much.   my emptiness has overflowed into a cataclysm of dread and sorrow.  i went to therapy finally  quite recently.  people say money can t buy happiness but after 8 appointments i got a bill for over 600 dollars. whoever says that is either a fool or an asshole. after seeing the bill i canceled all further appointments and haven t gon back since. hadn t gone long enough to make any real progress towards anything.   i did however find out that i have a severe form of dysthymia. which is basically just persistent depressive. and also general anxiety.   i m sure this isn t an unheard of thing but i am basically never not in a state of depression  it s almost like being bipolar  but with a smaller mood range. i am either terribly sad  depressed  or helplessly  hopelessly  exhaustively woven into despair that i crawl into bed after work and cry for hours  and everytime i think its over and try to get out of bed i take a couple steps and realize that i am not done and have to go back to it.   apparently it happens at some point in a lot of people lives but i have never not felt this way  for as long as i can remember. i cant find true joy in anything  my life consists of finding things that might make me happy and working towards obtaining them only to get them and have them become just another thing. i think that is how my collection started  i collect comic books and figurines  books. i think my collection is the only thing i can consider myself proud of though. it s like i can t grow myself so i instead watch it grow  each new thing a small victory  proof that i m alive and building something. like some sort of faux legacy to pass on  i am meaningless to this world but maybe i will live on in my stuff  heirlooms to pass down or something.   even when i was empty i believed that i just had to push  that i could make my life something. prove to people who wronged me that i was worth more. they would live in the shadow of my success and finally feel the worthlessness i have felt.   now though i am not empty  i am losing hope everyday.  is this it  the meaning of life  not surviving  not prevailing  just existing.  existing until it s not time to exist anymore. every day you give up just a little bit more  a personal race to break your last record of perseverance. to see how long you can make it  how long it takes for you to give up. truth is  we all would have given up by now. i am not sure if the reason is the same for everyone.   my reason for still being here is because i m worried the afterlife might be boring. interesting right  this may be our only time and even if it is terrible and nothing good ever happens  at least i m not bored.  i could be reincarnated as an anime protagonist in a world where my life could mean something  not without turmoil but with wonder and awe  and maybe a harem i don t know  don t judge me .   it seemed like a goofy joke at first  reincarnated into a magical world where the problems were different but i could mean something to someone or something  surrounded by friends who are cool but also kind.  throw in some overpowered bullshit powers and i am good to go.   it started as a joke but i want that. i want to be somewhere else  i want to be someone else. a different world  i different plane of existence where i could start over without the problems of before. somewhere where it would be possible to truly find peace.   i want that. i dont want to die never knowing what happiness felt like  only to live an eternity of regret and emptiness. hardships are eternal wherever you go but please let me be able to find joy in things.   a quote i always like was  you can either live a life of meaning  or you can live a life of happiness. you cannot have both.   i already can t be happy  a life of meaning makes the most sense. now i fear  i will not have either.,2021-08-30 15:33:22
116922,i knew that at age 20 i d have to make some big decisions about what i wanted to do with my life and   since the only thing i wanted was to die   suicide really felt like the way to go. i turned 21 in a panic because i didn t think this far. i made decisions that i didn t have the motivation to follow through with. the only thing i ve done since turning 21 is live and even that has been like pulling teeth.  i haven t been able to drop the thought that i should ve died years ago. every birthday and new year s eve feels like a punch in the gut and those are the two hardest days of the year for me. i hate myself for not killing myself when i was 20. i ve thought about killing myself every day for the past week and the only reason i haven t done it is because i don t want to disturb my family s lives. i knew at 15 that my life wouldn t be worth living and up to this point i ve proved myself right. every day is a reminder that i m alive for nothing and that i would be better off dead. i can t fucking stand it. i hate myself so much i can t even look at myself in the mirror anymore.   i don t know what i m supposed to do with these feelings.,2021-03-14 16:54:53
29494,i really don t think many people like me or think anything of me. besides my daughter  which is great but it s still hard when you have no friends or anyone else close  it s lonely. i don t exactly have any friends. i have one good friend  who lives a couple hours away so we don t see each other much. i am a reserved  shy person so making friends has always been hard. but even when i have had friends  it felt like i was always the last resort and an after thought.   i have a lot of family  but i don t feel like they truly like me either. i feel like they all judge me. and i can t open up emotionally to any of them because they don t understand what i feel and also because i can tell it gets on their nerves  and they just wanna talk about themselves. my mom for example  i love her but she just likes to talk about her problems and makes it about herself  and basically dismisses my problems.  my boyfriend and father of my daughter. i feel like he only  loves  me because he doesn t want anyone else to have me.  basically i feel like i m just kinda there to everyone  and nothing more  besides to my daughter of course . i also hate where i live. still living at home with my mom and stepdad  who i don t even get along with  stresses me out so so bad and i absolutely hate it. of course i really wanna move away  i think it d help my mood a lot but right now i have nowhere to go because i don t have enough money to move.   i m just so tired of never feeling or being good enough for anything anyone. i m not a perfect person  and yes it takes me awhile to open up  but i always try to be a good person. i wish i wasn t shy  i wish i wasn t so anxious  i hate it  but i really can t help it. i just don t know what to do.,2020-05-10 18:43:45

10562,always accept yourself for the way you are. you are thin  you are short  you are fat  it doesn t matter. always remember that if you cannot accept yourself for who you are  the society won t accept you. make peace with yourself. someone makes fun of the way you look  just smile and move on. no one is born the same in this world. good looking people didnt choose to be good looking. they are just born like that. we live in a society  even in 21st century  that still directly or indirectly judges looks. be confident no matter how you look. even if the society makes fun of you  you are no less than any other human being. your actions define who you are  not your looks. you never chose how you look. you are born like that. so be confident in who you are.,2021-12-16 23:09:42

76494,i ve just been thinking about all of my halloweens for the past for years and they were absolute dog shit.  4 years ago i dressed up for halloween just to sit alone on a bench because not even my friends wanted to hang out with me. 3 years ago i went to the store  bought myself 3 pounds worth of candy  and ate it all that night because i was so sad that i had no one. 2 years ago i did the same thing as last year and cried myself to sleep. last year i went trick or treating with my friend that soon after left me with the rest of my friend group.  this year my parents did not want to even see me because i didn t call them. like really  i m going through the worst time of my life. i can t even get up and go outside. i just spend all day in bed wondering what it would be like to have someone care about me just so the story could end with them leaving me. i can t even connect with anyone anymore and they re trying to make everything about them. fuck this ,2020-11-01 00:10:41

5617, apologies in advance  my first language is not english   why you can t focus  subconsciously  you do not want to stay with the breath. there are thousand other preoccupations.  this deeper layer is not accessible to you yet. hence the ancient technique of repeatedly bringing attention back to the breath. patient and consistent practice is the key. at an opportune moment  a resolve will rise up from deep inside to shed all preoccupations and really pay attention to the breath. and a glimpse of a deeper layer of being will be revealed.  you know the old saying  stop and smell the roses. in this case  stop and notice the breath.,2021-12-11 21:04:46

40667,my wife and i split up last year. i went through a major depression due to the separation. today i was clearing some old games off my xbox and i saw minecraft... i logged in and entered the world my wife and i had played together in. in an instant  i was deeply saddened as i walked through the empty house we had built together. the melancholy music really got to me. i saw how there was two of everything as we both lived in this house we built together...  it wasn t until i saw her diamond armor hanging inside the bedroom that i started to cry.,2020-06-18 18:36:42
141854,as a bit of context  i m 21 as of last week. i was raised in a christian family. my parents have always been loving and supportive. i graduated debt free with my first associate s degree in information technology a couple of months ago. i also have a fully paid off car  two younger siblings  an able body and mind  etc. i have a lot to be grateful for  yet i still feel depressed and dissatisfied with my life. i feel guilty for feeling this way as i know it could always be a lot worse.  depression is horrible. it robs me of my joy and makes it hard to enjoy the moments that make life so precious. it fills my mind with lies and tries to convince me that life isn t worth living. it almost has me convinced and i don t know what to do. it s insidious in how it goes about its evil ways. sometimes  it blindsides me  and other times it creeps in slowly. i m doing everything in my power not to let it take me. i ve been hospitalized twice  once for a few days and another time for a little over a week. i m thinking of getting a tattoo to mask the scars on my arms. some days i feel like i m on top of the world  and other days knock me flat on my face and make me feel like my life will never get better. depression changes how i view myself  people  and the world as a whole. i understand that life is relatively short in comparison to eternity  so i try to enjoy every precious moment that i can with the ones i love and who also love me. i ve missed out on a lot of moments with family and friends because of this pain i feel inside. i m trying to stay strong  but it s hard to live with all of this anger inside. depression is a thief and i m tired of allowing it to change my perception of life. i don t see it as a gift anymore and i feel like i m on autopilot. every day is an effort to pass the time so i can go to sleep  wake up  and repeat. i feel like i m on autopilot and i m not in the driver s seat of my life anymore. it s hard to keep trucking forward  but i feel it s all i can do other than taking my life. i m blinded by the pain of my circumstances  so much so that i have a hard time recognizing how much good i m surrounded by. can someone convince me that life is worth living ,2021-06-20 14:27:16
195495,have you ever reached the point where you realize you re over your head in your meds  or maybe they have finally started working after years of trying different things   i m reading a book right now that recounted a fantasy of a girl who had lost her sister to a tragic murder. she spent the day on the beach playing volleyball and drinking beers with her late sister. towards the end  she recognized it for the fantasy it was and cried in her sister s arms to only have that one moment again with someone you lost that you beg god for. i cried. i haven t felt something so emotional in a long time. for someone to put in writing what i could only feel inside.   so have i built up such a tolerance that the emotions i m trying to bury have snuck their way back in  or are they finally staring to work  or is it that someone has finally been able to describe that feeling you have inside when you have lost someone so close to you that you can never recover from  when will i ever find myself again ,2021-12-30 22:23:53
121735,i started thinking about this because i have wanted to try going for a run for a while now  i ve been told it helps with the brainfog  but i cant bring myself to even consider it if my parents are home  which they always are because of the pandemic now . i don t really know why but i just get embarassed just from the fact that they aknowledge my existance. even if i am doing something good for me like studying or reeding or exercice i will hide it from them just to avoid any coment. like i will rapidly hide the book i m reading and pretend like i was using my phone if they come into my room. i don t know why but i feel like it has always been this way  like i spent eight years studying music and playing an instrument even when i really didn t like it and i never told them.,2021-04-08 19:53:23

29204,i have been battling this bullshit for a year and i think about dying everyday  no one understands my fucked up mindset and no one loves me for who i am. people only love me for the image i put out and i can t talk to anyone about what i m going through because i hear the same god damn thing from everyone  i m here for you and you can tell me anything . people try to help me to feel better about themselves and it s obvious. that s why i have cut off all my friends. my parents say i m acting stupid when i say i wanna die so ive come to realize that i can t depend on anyone but myself because really  you re the only person who understands yourself and your the one who s fighting this battle  no one else. so.... fuck life  i m done caring.,2020-05-09 18:18:41
4679,i think it makes it much more comfortable for the person being asked which will also probably make them like you more since you re being considerate of their privacy and space.   also i think  can i give you my number   sounds cooler than  can i have your number   lol  and don t say  text me now  so i have your number cause that kinda defeats the purpose.,2021-07-07 19:59:14

87498,do you ever actually open up or try to talk honestly about the way you re feeling  then people cut you off or act like they know better.    i m actually feeling really hopeless to      it s just because  this  happened  you ll feel better.  or  you ve just got to be more positive.   okay i ll shut up  everyone knows better than me anyway  even if i m talking about myself.,2020-12-06 21:41:29
136732,personally  not only has the  fake it  til you make it  method never worked for me but it actually made my depression even worse than it already was because i got so good at pretending like nothing was wrong with me and hiding it from everyone around me so they wouldn t worry that i ended up trying to kill myself early last year and nearly died from internal bleeding hypothermia as a result of the suicide attempt it lead to because i deluded myself into thinking that everything was fine and would eventually get better for me. do people actually do this or is it just another bullshit clich  phrase that s tossed out like cheap candy and doesn t really mean anything  in a similar place again so i d really like to know.,2021-06-01 22:29:15

157868,basically  what the title says... i feel so toxic for wanting to just... isolate and see if they check up on me. i don t want to be a toxic friend to them. they acknowledge their faults and try to communicate. then there s me. i want to isolate to see who cares that i m hurt. isolate and escape into other worlds through reading or watching shows in bed all day long. i know my therapist wouldn t approve  but it feels like everything hurts and keeps getting harder. these are the first friends i ve made in over a year.,2021-08-16 01:37:10

194107,would be cool if any former long term depressed peeps here could share their survivor story here. things like how bad their situation was and what they did to climb out of it.  i tried to find an active subreddit for it  but with no luck.  of course the thing is  people who recover probably don t browse this sub anymore  and probably wouldn t want to  since it may bring up bad thoughts emotions again .,2021-12-25 06:23:12

129372,sometimes when my life gets harder than regular i get this feeling of wanting to kill my self. it s not that i don t want to commit suicide  i just have this feeling that i no longer want to exist in order to not experience the pain and self doubt that i do on a regular basis. it feels like a train of intrusive thoughts urging me to kill myself  when i feel the underlying issue is my brain trying to find the path of least resistance to address my problems. how can i combat these thoughts and what are some life changes i can make to relieve some of the pain i put on myself by being so self conscious with who i am. any advice is greatly appreciated  thank you in advance.,2021-05-08 00:01:21

87771,hi everyone  i m a junior in college who s been diagnosed with moderate depression for about 2 years now.  i ve been to therapy and have battling with depression anxiety for some time now. i ve been doing alright  but as we all know it can be extremely hard sometimes to deal with as time goes on. the pervasive thoughts and anxiety while talking to people make me want to   perhaps tell my circle of friends directly or make a social media post letting ppl know. i kind of want to do it just to be more honest with myself and those around me  though i am worried that ppl may view or treat me differently. my extremely close friends know  though i have this feeling in me to spread it to everyone or a bigger circle at least. what do you guys think  if anyone has any experience with this i would love to hear from you. thank you so much for reading  i look forward to your responses.,2020-12-07 13:09:09

142221,i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression as a teenager  and i was medicated with ssris for about a year before deciding to stop them. they helped me get better  but i didn t like the associated changes in my brain i felt foggy and just  off  and i didn t like the idea that a substance was impacting my thoughts and behavior. i did try one different antidepressant  which made me more suicidal  before the one i ended up taking for a year.    i am now an adult and i have not been rediagnosed  but i still deal with these issues most days. i have coping strategies i have developed so i am not as bad as i was as when i was originally medicated  but i still have many bad days. i feel like my depression is holding me back  but i am afraid if i seek treatment i will hate being on medication again.   i m open to any suggestions you all have  and i would love to hear if anyone else has had similar experiences with ssris and what worked for you.,2021-06-21 17:30:14

12155,  tl dr    once you learn how to pronounce things in a language  learn how to make sentences using verbs  to be    can    must    to need    to want  and   to have   as these are used very commonly in everyday language. also learn how to turn them into questions and how to negate them. you ll be able to express a lot of things very quickly this way  possibly after your first or second lesson.  i am a native speaker of czech and i teach it to exchange students who come to my country every semester. when i first started teaching  i was told to follow a textbook  which spends about four or five chapters  none of which can easily be finished in one sitting  on stuff like saying hello  describing what stuff looks like  asking for time and such. while those are  of course  good things to learn eventually  i felt like my students needed to spend way too many hours studying  before they learned something they could actually use in real life situations.  so what i ve started doing is teaching them how to make statements using the verbs  to be    can    must    to need    to want  and  to have  as the first thing  after pronunciation   since these are very commonly used in everyday language. it s good to be able to use them at least in first  second and third person singular  e.g. i am  you are  he   she   it is . making questions out of them is in many languages as easy as swapping words around  e.g. in german  du bist...    gt  bist du...  . negating statements is then again usually as easy as adding a preposition or a prefix  e.g. in spanish  puedes...    gt  no puedes...  in czech  m  e ...    gt  nem  e ... .  when you know how to start sentences using these verbs  you can very easily expand upon the range of things you re be able to say by learning new nouns. sure  you might sound a bit crude  but you can always learn how to sound more sophisticated later and it s always better to sound primitive and get the meaning across than not being able to express yourself at all  especially in countries where speaking english is often not an option  like in parts of eastern europe or latin america .,2022-01-27 06:07:56
4811,i was fixing our lawn mower today and wondered if my partner would know how. yesterday  she made me a formulated tea to help ease the wallop from my second vaccine. when she gets her second  i want to know how to make the same formula to support her.    this all made me think about other divisions of labour around the house and what are some of the things i do  and what are some of the things she does and what i need to learn from her.,2021-07-11 15:02:25
4881,has anyone here ever shifted gears in life and found themselves completely grown out of whole friend groups  and drifting away from people who you thought were going to be in your life forever   i m the type of person that if i bond with somebody  i plan on establishing a long term connection. i don t have a strong family bond  so i choose my family if that makes sense  and when i forge a friendship it s not just a friendship to me. it s more like becoming family. i either relate to people really well and can click with them like that  or i don t. i can be very raw with my emotions and not everyone can handle that. well  my best friend  sister  who was in my life for 7 years just disappeared out of the blue. there s obviously more to the story  it s just long. and it still doesn t make sense. i really haven t had a good friend since. it s been about 2 years and i can t seem to relate to anyone anymore. it s a lonely path. isolating. and i m not sure what to do,2021-08-10 17:00:28
5040,i have been friends with someone almost 20yrs  and i am using the word friends very loosely. but she calls me her best friend.  over the yrs she has a way of making comments  and acts like it is a joke.  because of this i keep my distance  i brush it off  but ultimately i never liked it  but gave it the benefit of the doubt. and it happens only  rare  occasions. i would be telling a lie if i said she has never been supportive when i needed it.  the other day i posted on fb  that my son took a trip to chicago.  she comments.   that s right antonio  see the world        because your mother wont       i was rather annoyed  i felt like she was making me the joke.on a public platform. i deleted her comment. because i am not going to be the brunt of her ignorant comments.  was i overreacting ,2021-08-16 00:31:57

61561,almost hard to believe  but i m about to be 33 years old. but i still haven t left my teenage phase. never left home  never achieved anything  never made trouble  never took risks  never  lived . how was this really the only option for me  really does feel like i was a mistake in this universe. too weird dumb for normal people  too logical to deal with assholes. so i stay to myself. can t work a job  can t be covered by any agency. so the day my parents pass  which i fear may be any day   that s pretty much the end of my story as well because i m not gonna burden anyone else. if my parents had any real sense  they d have kicked me out  loooong  ago. if i had somehow made a turn for the better while i was out there  then great. if not  it would just be natural selection at work.   every day  i fantasize about just vanishing without a trace. striking out into the world with no aim  letting come what may. i wouldn t even plan on being alive long but at least i ll have experienced something for once before i left this world. but i know if i did that while my parents were alive  they d just be hurt and worry themselves to an early  or earlier  grave. my conscience is already weighed down to hell. don t need that extra. so all i can do is bide my time and wait. kinda fucked up  but it is what it is.  there is no help to be given  there is no  fixing  this. if you were cursed with being me  you d get it. so any type of basic  advice  won t even be considered. this is just a whiney rant.,2020-09-03 09:55:36

5809, as long as you are a beginner certain formalized meditations or prayers may be good for you. but for a seeker for reality there is only one meditation   the rigorous refusal to harbour thoughts.   i like this because refusing to harbor thoughts seems possible to me and something to practice  at least in my experience preventing thoughts from arising in the first place is impossible  so this feels less intimidating    anyways just wanted to share. merry christmas and happy holidays to everyone    ,2021-12-25 15:34:09

86977,hey redditors   it s been difficult for me to remain positive lately. for months now i ve felt like i m in a slump and can t seem to find a balanced lifestyle. to be honest  i m pretty lonely. i have like two or three friends whom i talk to sometimes and meet up with  and while i don t think i necessarily need more to become happier  my life still feels like it s gotten to a halt. i ve studied in college for around 2 years and chose to leave based on some drug problems i ve had in the past  and now i m 23 and restarting university in a degree i m not particularly passionate about. my plans are to go to a different country to get a bachelor in hospitality  but my worries are if i continue there i ll be in the same position that i am in now  being unhappy with myself and all in all lonely and unable to find a new circle of friends. at the moment i surround myself with books and try to keep up with my current studies  but those seem like temporary solutions to this high stake problem. it feels like my life is basically over at this point and i ve had some suicidal thoughts too  but i also cling on some hope thinking it might get better in the future. do you have similar problems  let me know what you think   ,2020-12-05 13:56:25
7214,if you re in the highway for a while and you don t have any traffic lights to hit  speeding will save you some time.  but the thing that saves most time on road trips is the frequency you make pit stops.  also speeding uses more fuel and uses brakes to faster.  also it s dangerous.  also all that speeding you did to get to work prob only saved you 30 seconds at most.,2021-09-12 20:34:25

1833,hi everyone  i d like to ask if those of you who are cigarette smokers  or used to be  would say that smoking negatively affects your meditation practice or if being a smoker and a meditator are two things that can coexist.  of course  smoking is generally a harmful activity and doesn t exactly contribute to your mental and physical health  but what i m interested in are views on smoking and meditation specifically.  thanks for reading ,2021-05-10 06:55:44
161725,like what  procrastinating all day and be in constant inner turmoil about being completely able to make yourself better and more skilled yet you just don t  and you guide others to change  at the end of the day  you re just a stupid piece of shit who deserves no one and in return you ve earned nothing to begin with. and then after you re done you just sit on your phone  browsing  occasionally learning something  because it effectively neutralises your mind  as if putting you on morphine because you want this to stop for just a second.,2021-08-29 19:38:50
6664,i will start my post by saying that i had depression since i was in middle school. in highschool it got worse. people started making fun of me cuz of my looks  i was pretty skinny . i started going to the gym but they kept on making jokes about me. after highschool i tried going to a psychiatrist but i felt like she couldn t help me with my problem so i quit going to her. i gotta say i have serious social anxiety. i feel so bad when i m around people and i feel tensed up. i hate people noticing me  i m afraid of them wanting to talk to me cuz i will mess things up and feel like shit afterwards. most of time i stay at home and play my guitar. when i m at work  even though i m around my co workers i feel lonely. sometimes i have hand tremors and feel like my nerves are about to explode. i can t keep living like this. i would rather die than living my life like this. also i have ocd  i searched the symptoms online and i noticed that it might be my problem. i m really obbsessed with what people think about me. i feel like i m constantly watched by someone judging my actions or me as a person. i am desperate and that s the reason i m making this post. i thought about living in the woods because  maybe it will be better off without me. thought about suicide aswell but i didn t try it yet. i might do it because i feel like i can t take it anymore. is there anyone else out there who feels what i feel  can someone help me  this is my last call for help.,2020-02-21 12:08:30
59701,today i lost a relationship that i hold close to my heart because i am a bad person and used my mental illness as a leverage for being abusive. she was supportive and kind  so i took her for granted and subconsciously pressured her into dealing with my problems. it got so bad that she began to be depressed too  but i never noticed that and kept on abusing her. not until her boyfriend became so concerned and told me directly  that i finally snapped out of it. in the end i cut ties with her because my damage done is irreversible and we both agreed it is better this way. i am devastated because i love her so much  but my negligence and  taking someone for granted  mentality have done so much damage to a kind and sweet person that genuinely cared about me  to the point that is so toxic that none of us can keep on being friends. so please  it s great to have someone besides you in your toughest days  but please understand that they can also be vulnerable human beings themselves.,2020-08-27 07:16:55
157637,i m finding it harder and harder to get out of bed every day. even when i do manage to plant two feet on the ground and make it out of my bedroom  i usually find myself desperate to go back and just try and sleep the day away. i don t know what s wrong with me. i ve suffered from clinical depression my entire life  with bouts of moderate to severe generalized anxiety  but something feels different right now. i don t know if it s because of everything going on in the country world  but i just feel hopeless  like nothing is ever going to change. i ve had some suicidal ideation issues over the last year  that have gradually gotten more intense. part of me wishes i wasn t such a chicken and just to go for it  but i know i never will. i m too scared  so i ll just stay miserable on what i assume is going to be a permanent basis. the only thing that makes me feel better is delta 8 thc  which makes me completely forget about how i feel temporarily  but also makes me as useful as a screen door on a submarine. but  at least for a few moments  i have some relief. i don t really even know why i m posting here  but i guess i just thought it might be therapuetic to scream into the metaphorical void. but  i guess it s time to go back to bed.,2021-08-15 07:39:17

119910,i  20f  am really short  4 feet 8 inches   and and just like everyone else i gained weight in the year 2020. in december i started going to gym with my sister and after 4 months of diet and exercise i lost 2 kgs. i also have been depressed for more than a year but no one knows about this cause i didn t tell anyone and just started having episodes of sleep paralysis in this week. and this never happened with me before. so i was little scared of going back to sleep. and when i told my parents and sister they weren t even interested  so that made me sad cause i always listen to their problems but i feel like when it comes to me no one cares. anyway in the last 3 days i was doing better other than crying once a day over work things and my height thing.      so today when i went to gym  amp  my sister s friend was also there. i just know him but we never really talked but i know he does call me pennywise and that s why i call him voldemort. so today my sister sent me ss of their chat and he was saying that he saw lots of difference in my sister s weight but i looked more fat than i was before  then she asked him again  and he said he was serious. don t know why it made me cry for like half an hour  maybe i just needed a reason to cry. also i get suicidal thoughts sometimes but i know i am not gonna do it cause i don t have guts to do that plus i don t want to be the reason of anyone else s sadness.,2021-04-03 11:25:00
198085,i got married in may. the marriage has been wonderful  and the absolute best thing ever to happen in my life bar none. my wife is wonderful  beautiful  strong  and supportive.  a week before our wedding  my work informed me they wouldn t approve any time off for it  basically forcing me to quit. since then  job searching has been hell and i ve been hit with blow after blow  as well as failings and struggles in my personal life. i felt at rock bottom  and the thought came unbidden that  i wish i didn t get married so i could kill myself without regret . it s obviously untrue  i don t at all wish i didn t get married and i could never do that to her  but i broke down at work.  i m so exhausted. i ve been off medication for months because my insurance and refills ran out. insurance for this job that i just started doesn t kick in for a month. on top of that  just as i was getting used to this job  she got fired over christmas vacation. we haven t been able to pay our own rent in months  and now i m starting to realise this job misled me and is not nearly as good for me mentally as i thought it would be.  i m better now  and i m not suicidal  but i m so exhausted. i told her i m so tired of being me  and i don t know how to move forward. but i can t tell her that thought  could never do that to her. i finally broke down and told her about the job  and of course she supported me and supported looking for a new one. i feel so worthless  like i don t deserve her. i m so tired of this feeling   ,2022-01-09 21:11:45

31599,i can count my close friends on one hand and total friends on two. apart from my one childhood friend  i ve had people actively take interest in hanging out with me twice in the last 6 years. i either have to half invite myself to a get together or spend weeks to get someone to spend a few hours with me. after losing touch with one of my close friends for a bit  i try to schedule some time with them. but of course they re super busy all of next week. and will then post them hanging out with other friends.  i dont know what i expect. im a sarcastic annoying peice of shit  with a fucking terrible sense of humor that makes people laugh 5  of the time. i ve never even held someone elses hand  let alone have a gf bf. i ll think to myself  oh its just because your overweight . i ll have the motivation to do something about for a week at best then just fucking stop. but even if i could get my lazy ass to a be more fit it wouldnt matter. my body isnt what drives people from caring about me or finding me attractive. i do that well enough on my own.,2020-05-18 01:19:25
7458,when you see a puppy out and about it s understandable to want to immediately give it attention   but remember that dogs learn behaviour based on reinforcement. if an owner is trying to train their dog to be calm around strangers  and you approach and start patting it and talking to it before the owner can adjust its behaviour to their desired outcome  you re reinforcing a behaviour the owner may not want. remember  you don t need to live with a dog s undesirable behaviour but the owner does  and you teaching it that getting excited and pulling at a lead will be rewarded is doing no favours. please consider that no dog owner owes you a canoodle with their puppy  so you should be asking permission as a courtesy anyway.  instead  turn your attention to the owner and ask if you can approach their dog before giving it attention. many owners will have no problem  and those who are trying to train their dog would totally welcome the opportunity to treat it as a learning exercise for them too  and give you some instructions on how to approach  wherein they ll be able to enforce their dog s behaviour. they get the chance to expose him to a stranger  and you ve earned a puppy pat  it s a win win.  tl dr   please respect that a dog is it s owner s property and seek permission before engaging with it.,2021-09-20 05:19:41
629,note  was called out for  piggybacking  in a post i ll soon delete. fair  they were right and i should have checked the rules. having been said  i still feel this post has merit. i hope i ve sufficiently reworked it to stand on its own.  reflection on previous chapters in your life is both important and rewarding. carrying beat up cardboard boxes of art journals polaroids knickknacks threadbares everywhere you go well into your adult life is an expensive chore and source of frustration for the people around you. in the spirt of compromise  limit yourself to one or two hard plastic totes  stackable with wheels  for the truly priceless treasures  and if the tote starts to snap crack disintegrate  please replace it. they re pretty affordable. your wallet  your significant other  and your lower back will thank you.  tldr  stay organized,2021-03-02 13:04:17
127007,i feel so alone. i got in to a really good university with the sat and it s a much easier test than the ones my classmates had to take. i basically got in to a really good uni even though im stupid and absolutely don t deserve it. i m horrible at all of my classes. just horrible horrible grades. i don t even have the motivation to put some effort in to them. i just sit and watch my failure. i m only good at things i really enjoy doing. like last month i decided to start a clay business and absolutely loved it. i was making pottery for 5 6 hours and enjoying every second of it. i loved it so much that i wouldn t study for any of my classes and id just spend that time making pottery too. my small business plan failed and again i suck at even something i loved. i hate my major but have no idea which other one id like. i can t even choose a major       i hate this so so sooooo much. i just wanna become a youtuber or an instagram model but id probably suck ass at that too. i don t wanna work. i hate working. i hate hard work for things that i don t enjoy but it s literally impossible to like your classes so tf is my stupid ass gonna do. i don t live in this perfect pony princess land where im just gonna love everything i do. why the hell can t i just suck it up and study     i m shy  awkward  ugly  insecure and just full of negativity. i have 0 friends even though everyone loved me at school. i just don t want anyone around me when i feel this horrible and disgusting.   sorry this rant is all over the place. i just wrote whatever came to mind and didn t really care ab the structure lmao,2021-04-30 05:00:48

19306,i m really trying my hardest. they should be glad i m still trying. they should be glad i m not suicidal anymore. they should be glad i m trying to get out of bed every day. they should be glad i m still trying to find purpose for my life.  i m doing everything i can at the moment even tho i ve been really bad mentally recently. but still they keep mentioning the stuff i m doing wrong like getting out of bed in the late afternoon. i can t even defend my self properly because my mind is a mess and i keep messing up my sentences.  i tried everything to change it. like medicine  not using my phone and ipad before i go to bed  skipping a night of sleep to go to bed early the next day  just going to bed early  etc. nothing freaking helped.   maybe i should just give up. i m sick of trying my hardest for myself when it doesn t help and for people who don t seem to notice. all it does is hurting me and tiring me out.,2020-04-04 16:51:33
54383,i have all the platforms to distract me     my dad had sent me money to get a better pc and so i have been messing around with a lot of games. i try my best to listen to more music  which always turns out to be a bad idea for i end up listening to a playlist with music filled with heavy subjects of escapism .  so far  i think i ve tried everything     to rid myself of this feeling. i had painted the walls of my room  changed the color of the floors among others. this feeling is constant     it just gets buried but never ends up dead.  ultimately  what i m trying to get at is that do any of you have any ways of ridding this feeling  i ve tried smoking weed with a friend a number of times and that helped a lot. i smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol and that does help too. however  if there are any ways that you know help you escape reality without the detriment of your health  tell me.  i don t wanna be happy. i just wanna be okay to the point that i can wade through the rest of my existence without ending it prematurely  which would cause greater fuss and damage than if i were just to try and live it out .,2020-08-06 23:53:00
24010,i remember just a few years ago  i wanted to get into a private school. i worked my ass off to get there. did a big academic program and everything  even gave the graduation speech for it. so i get in and everythings great for the first few years. then in 8th grade life hit me like a truck and i quite frankly didn t know what to do with myself. fuck  i still don t know. i m in 9th grade now  and everything matters now. that stress took it s toll on me and well  i fell behind. first trimester i was failing 3 classes and was barely managing a b for the other two classes. i thought nothing could be worse than the dissappointment on my parents face when i brought home my term grades. i was so  so wrong. because then the self hatred kicked in  and i started to hate my worthless ass for wasting the last 5 years of work just to mess it up cause i was in my feelings. that quickly turned into me doing a brief stint at a mental facility. and here s the kicker  i came back partway through the trimester and i worked my ass off again. and i raised most of my grades and i was actually proud of myself  because it felt like shades of the old me were coming back. but now i don t know what to do. between this whole outbreak and online school  i m back down in the dumps and i m behind yet again on so much. it s just a struggle to stay afloat  and right after i got that nice gasp of air  too. i just don t know what i can do to find myself again  and find something to motivate me to make it through. because as of right now  it takes all of my energy to get up and sit through classes  and i can t even focus on my work.   this was a long and pointless rant  but i m stuck at a crossroads here. i don t want to waste the years i spent working to get where i am  but i just can t find that fire i had before.,2020-04-22 06:51:57

47916,whenever i run i always give pedestrians the right  of way but typically they get out of the way themselves... it s just  common courtesy.  towards the end of my run this morning the pavement narrowed to about  5ft and there were 3 people walking side by side  taking up the whole  width of the pavement . i looked over my shoulder and there was constant  traffic coming up the road alongside me  so i had nowhere to go. i  slowed down really slow and got to the outside of the pavement   expecting one man to tuck in and let me get past. well i m looking at  him and he s staring at me smugly as if to say  i m not moving . i got  within a foot of him and he wouldn t move at all and i just flipped... i  yelled  get out of the way  and punched him in the side  i think i  mainly brushed the canvas bag he was wearing .  i didn t bother turning around and there was no retaliation from him.  i am often angry these days due to despression  frustration... simply having a crap life. i can feel it brimming under the surface.  today was a brief flicker of anger but what if he had retaliated  i can honestly say i would have done something stupid like pushed him into the traffic or tried to throttle him.  i need help with my anger and mood but there is no help. my gp do not give a shit. they never help me with anything and the nhs is useless.  i feel like my mental state has deteriorated over the past 5 10 years and unless my life gets better  job  career  friends  gf  purpose in life  nothing will change.  i feel trapped. everyday is pure misery and i am honestly so tired of this world.,2020-07-13 11:04:01

151384,to make a long story short  i grew up in an arab household. crying or expressing emotions as a man wasn t appropriate and would be seen as a weakness and emasculate you.   i picked up on that quiet early as i once cried as a kid around 7 ish years and got in trouble for doing that. ever since i have never cried in front of my family. sadly it caught on fast and i can t cry even when i am extremely sad.   i am often so depressed and just want to cry it all out and feel better afterwards  but i just can t cry. and to add on top of that  i am in a long committed relationship and my girlfriend  f22  easily cry when she s upset or sad which makes it harder for her to understand me being sad or depressed as i don t  express  it by crying    anyone else not able to cry and how to get those feelings out      td lr depressed but can never cry. growing up i always got shamed for showing emotions and crying which made me eliminate those.,2021-07-24 11:32:20

9989,a year ago something happened in our small group of friends of five  including me . what happened has a lot of layers that i won t go into. but we all made poor choices and lacked proper communication and understanding. my friend didn t want me to talk to them anymore. they needed time.  it has been over a year now. ive reached out a couple times.  im honestly just tired. our whole friend group suffers from them continuing this silence. i would just like closure even if they just vent and say goodbye that is better than wondering when they will message again.,2021-12-25 20:58:13
33705,long post. tldr at the end.  i just need to vent but i guess i should provide some context as well. i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about a year ago due to having a bit of a breakdown during my fourth year at university. i was halfway through my atp  final prac for primary school teaching  and i just could not handle the stress nor did i agree with sacrificing sleep to get work done  then teach the next day. i couldn t function like that without making a lot of mistakes.  i m fairly certain i have been dealing with these conditions since my childhood  my psychologist agrees  and my current living conditions just makes stress a part of every day life. i am almost 30 years old  have arthritis in my spine  and i m still stuck at home  looking after my dad as his carer. most of my days are spent sitting next to him so i can get up and fetch anything he needs and rotate his entertainment e.g. dvds. also house keeping on top of this. he needs help getting to his appointments because he has trouble feeling his feet  needs help with bathing and needs me to give him an injection to treat one of his illnesses weekly.  now  onto the rant. i have a major problem with motivation. it just doesn t exist. it even stops me from doing any artwork which was something i was very passionate about. thankfully i have managed to hold onto creative writing but even that is slipping away from me. i am also low key suicidal where i constantly wish i was dead. so job hunting has been abandoned since the coronavirus pandemic started.  i live with my brother and his family  wife and two autistic children  who make a lot of mess every single day. now my dad is basically bed bound so he can t do any of the house or yard work. and it brings him down to see the house in such a mess. so he s constantly on my case about it. unfortunately... every time i clean up  the house is filthy again the next day thanks to my brother s family. so i honestly do not see the point in scrubbing the house. so i just doo the basics like the dishes  rubbish and laundry.   apparently it s not enough. my dad constantly tells me i need to do more. my back is always sore and i ve only just started complaining about it but it gets shot down by dad all the time. he blames me sitting all day for the pain whenever i do anything  can see some logic in that  and that i m using my depression and my sense of obligation to watch over him as an  excuse  not to do anything. if he was me he d be doing everything and get out there and get a job.  i wish i had the motivation to do anything. i wish i didn t constantly want to die. and i sure as fuck wish i could get a job. so needless to say. i got a little angry with this.  sorry for the very long post.   tldr  disabled dad believes i m using my depression as an excuse to slack off in life and chores.,2020-05-25 02:23:46

25408,tw  suicide  self harm    it s been almost two months since he ran away. we moved to a new area and we didn t let him outside for a couple weeks until he felt comfortable inside our house. he has a tendency to go a week or two without coming home but he always comes back. almost two months ago he went out and i didn t realize it would be the last time i saw him. he s been my baby for so long. he was the reason i stopped cutting and the reason why i fought against suicide for so long. i was ready to slit my wrists for good one night  while i was in the bath  and he decided to jump next to me even though he hates the water. i couldn t stop crying for so long at the thought that i would leave him. now he s left me and i don t know how i feel. i don t know how to get past it. and some people don t know the bond you have with your pet  maybe it doesn t compare to having children or a relationship but he was the first thing i was able to call mine. and i feel like i ve lost a part of me and it s finally hitting me  hard.,2020-04-27 04:20:47
80094,my mother abused me a lot when i was little. i know  what a nice way to start a post huh  she doesn t lock me outside and pour cold water on me anymore  and she hasn t left me with a visible scar for the last few years  so i know i would never be able to get removed from my home.  even though she doesn t physically abuse me anymore  she makes me feel a way that i wouldn t wish upon anyone. she screams at me for everything  every little mistake either she or i make. i get the blame for everything  even things that i had literally zero effect on  and it s getting old. i m tired of being told i m worthless because she ripped a piece of wallpaper by accident. i m tired of being told i m disgusting for eating healthy and exercising. i m just tired.  my brother moved out a couple years ago  and my dad has been gone for a long time now. he felp in to alcoholism and now he struggles to even feed himself one meal a day. i could go to live with my brother but he s abusive too and i feel like he would probably start the physical abuse again.  i have literally nowhere to go  and i don t have anyone to talk to about it because i m scared of what would happen. i don t think i can be removed from her care because there s no physical evidence  and it s just so painful.  is there literally anything that i can do ,2020-11-14 11:39:35

7159,snap your fingers  click your tongue  or whistle and wait for a response or to see if it gets their attention.  positive affirmation is really the only way to teach a dog  and if it s not concerned with pleasing you or gaining your approval it s going to make it harder.  all dogs are good boys and deserve good homes.  but they all have different personalities and finding the type of dog with the personality you like is going to make for a better relationship and a better situation for you both.  some people want a dog that s more of a  loner  and some people want a best friend that will always stay by their side.  most multiple dog homes will have some of each.,2021-09-11 10:22:50
24625, hi  i dont  really know if i m posting on the right sub but first  english isn t my usual language so it could get confused sometimes... and i could be rushing some part in my text too.   i don t really know where to start  i don t know what kind of behavior i have but it s pretty simple now   i want to be sad  to feel bad.  i don t know how could i describe it in another way and i know that i could sound like a typical teenager in his weird phase.  to talk about me i m 20yo  and almost 2 years ago i had a really bad period. because of love  familial problems  overthinking  poor social capacities and mostly a low self esteem  a thing that i still have now. this period has continued until last december but my daily life has changed just after christmas. cause everyone in my school had an internship and so we were not able  to see each other a lot. it lasted 2 months and at it end there was the quarantine that also made me not able to see my friends. so during this new period of 5 months now  my problems and way to think and feel has disappeared. well there still a little part but i was more kinda   happy  .  i went to the conclusion that it was my friends that made me pretty sad  and made me overthink. just the fact to get into the big circle on discord with them make me pretty inconfortable now. whatever  during this new period my brain has stopped to think to much  about   sad   things  it s like when i wanted to think about something bad and find some solution to it my brain just stopped to fonction  i wasn t able to go further in the reflexion.   and with this new behavior i ve started to feel like i was not the real me anymore. i was scared to not be thinking like the way i used before  by thinking too much and be able to have strong emotions. emotions and especially sad ones are the things that made me feel alive.  now i want to get back the   old me    even if i always feel useless and have a low self esteem. because i have the impression to be just a machine that live and do the same things as everyone do and then die. i don t want that  i want my emotions  i want the things that make me  the   real me  . i want to feel alive.   maybe i m not used to those new ways to be and feel  to feel   happy   in part  for the moment. but it s been months now that i m scared of me  of the what i m becoming into. i don t know  it s hard to explain how much i want to get my sad feelings and my old way to think.   and here the stupid part starts too  cause each days where i went to be sad so bad  i m thinking about taking a bottle of alcohol and scarify myself to let things go in my mind and immerse me in poor condition.   i know  it s stupid because maybe i ve reached to get out off my kind of depression but i want to get back in. maybe you ve felt the same  or maybe we could just talk about it. i don t really want some help  i want to talk and see your opinion  if i m not the only one to think like that.,2020-04-24 08:26:17

117251,i hate feeling like a disappointment to my parents. and it s worse when my parents  especially my dad  do well to remind me every day. my dad calls me things like retard  useless  etc and well  i believe him and i am useless so i cant talk back. i cant sleep because im just so lonely and just so upset. and it s not just regular loneliness  it s this overwhelming loneliness like feeling trapped and feeling like no one else in this world understands me or will ever understand me. i feel like everyone else in this world is competent except me. why cant i just be normal like everyone else  finance myself  do work  have a social life. seems like everyone s got their life together some way or somehow even when they say they don t. i always feel like my dad feels so ashamed of my existence. that i never was the son he wanted. i dont know what im writing. i just cant sleep because i keep screaming into my pillow and cursing.,2021-03-15 15:36:24

134734,he stopped showing interest in me and i was allowed to date others. before he rarely wanted sex and he hadn t touched me in over 2 months. i was honest about loving someone else and it was frustrating he was so far away plus never getting any from my own husband. i left to the other room. in return  he whipped me with a leather strip and raped me. now i m even more depressed  cut everything off with the other guy. then my husband admitted to never loving me and used me to get others so he seemed more appealing to them. about to hit 4 years together and he told me all this last week. now  he says he loves me and wants to fix me. i call bullsh t.,2021-05-25 21:46:56
3650,hello fellow redditors   im curious as to how you guys deal with growing older and the change that brings to friend groups. im 26 now and really see that everyone except me is getting less busy with the group and more with their girlfriends and own lives.  for example  the group chat is way more dead than before  we dont see eachother that more  at birthday parties of group members only half of the group is able to join  chats are way shorter. normally after a night out you could enjoy in the morning the pictures and stories of the night before  who hooked up  who puked etc. etc. now its more like  you went out  ah fun  yeah real good time. ok.  how do i deal with this   thanks   a fellow redditor,2021-07-04 20:50:44

84913,i don t know why i still find a reason to still be here. i want to stop and just constantly be in pain rather than feeling  okay  or  happy . i wish i can have the courage to actually end my life and to not regret everything i do. even my parents said that i dont have the courage to kill myself and they offered to give me a knife to cut my wrists even more. i hate being at home with them and i wish i could just run away and to just be away from them for a little bit. i don t know why a part of me still wants to go through this hell.,2020-11-28 19:42:54

97030,i know the span of this throwaway account s ramblings hasn t been that big  but i ve made a huge leap in my recovery  and that is   being inspired to actually get shit done.   i ve made a whole list of goals  i m going to dissect every one and make them more digestible within the next few days  until i have a huge organized list that i can compartmentalize. instead of pissing and moaning and feeling sorry for myself here  i m going to document my progress every once in a while. hopefully others can gain inspiration from what i share  though i am excited about this  i m also kind of confused  so this is both an announcement and a small vent dump of thoughts. just yesterday i was so depressed i relapsed. the regret and self hatred and guilt from that built up through this entire day until suddenly i had this weird clarity. i knew using healthier vices and improving my habits would help my depression from the get go  but everything just seems to click now for no reason. a part of me is concerned this ll only be temporary  and that even if i m extremely careful not to overwork myself into burnout with my ambitions for recovery  i ll still lose traction over time. i can only have faith that won t happen  and even though it s odd that i suddenly  do  have faith  i m glad i have it. i wanna ask though... has anyone else here had this happen  a weird rush of inspiration to do better against all odds  did it end up working out  is it a sign of something more sinister  any input on what is going on  and general tips on this whole thing  would be more than welcome,2021-01-03 02:02:19
5482,i don t work too hard. i work as needed  i m somewhat efficient  i don t stress  i don t go out of my way to hurry a project along and without a substantial amount of effort i m recognized by my superiors as a quality employee. i just got a raise actually because of my work ethic.  but as i said before i m not trying especially hard  i m just normal. its more a testament to my lazy coworkers that me just being decent at my job gets me any recognition at all.,2021-07-27 22:37:05
177322,my life has been kind of kind to me recently  but my mind always has to remind me of all of the worst things i have done  it really bothers me and makes me emotional on occasion  now i have fantasies of becoming an emotionless machine like ultron  yet i know that s not possible yet  that pisses me off for some reason  it s sounds incredibly stupid to me even . this drives me mad and i consider this a distraction that i just can t get rid of  i m so confused and i want this madness to end.,2021-10-25 15:08:37
43901,people die right. everyone has to die. you mourn like one day  two days  a week  a month and then it slowly stops. the pain is there but it s not the same one reason you cry everyday. and somedays it all just comes back all of it and you can t take the burden anymore. you just fall on your knees on the bedroom floor and just cry and cry and cry until you start sobbing until it just all stops. the total uncomforting silence hits you. it hits you so hard that your stomach hurts  you can t breathe  your throat hurts badly and heart pounding. but you are now sitting there not crying anymore just sitting. just staring at the bedroom floor and celling feeling numb. it s just how emptiness crawled into your room and is ripping through your chest. you are in it s womb. then you just get up wipe your tears and get into routine work because whatever you do you can t escape from the memories.,2020-06-29 23:57:09
95926,so for context  i ve been dealing with this whole depression thing for 4 years  and like a lot of people  it s been really bad this year. i have friends i wouldn t give up for anything  and they both aren t mentally stable  and i m really scared what one of them is going to do. he s been venting in a group chat  disappearing for weeks  and never coming back any better. he just wishes he could escape us  and this scares me  i don t think i can cope with anything  i can t really try to help  he won t let me  and even if i tried  i wouldn t do much good. my way of coping with things doesn t make sense to anyone  so i can never really say things clearly. i feel like i m just burdening everyone. i want to kill myself  but honestly  i d probably be more of a burden dead than alive. i was thinking about doing it today  but i just  wont. i m so scared of 2021. i don t want to lose anyone but i can t help them anyway.   sidenote  i m posting this here because i only feel safe venting about things with some sort of anonymity.,2020-12-30 23:37:31

1879,i m sorry if this isn t the right sub for this. i ve been a long time lurker on this sub  however  and wanted to ask if anyone had a similar issue. for context  i haven t meditated in a while due to stress about privacy and time  but i am trying to get back into it. in that time  my mental and physical health has become less well. i tried a short guided meditation yesterday  and decided that my mind was not in the headspace to do it. now comes today  and i meditated for around 10 minutes. not too long  but i see it as a nice way to  get back into  the practice of the mental state i stay in while meditating. but like the title of this post states  i noticed that even when i try to relax  my heart beats noticeably out of my chest. not in a way that is scary or that i can hear in other parts of my body   but a feeling i commonly attribute to stress and anxiety. the feeling turns on especially when i am just getting into the meditation  but subsides after. is this just because of anxiety and me noticing it easier in a meditative state  does anyone have any advice on letting my mind calm down when my body won t  thank you,2021-05-11 23:51:51

112348,so i have basically been in bed all day crying and putting off all my responsibilities because i m having a really bad mental health day  i don t think i ve ever felt this low and unmotivated. my mom found out that i  wasted  another day and screamed in my face that i m lazy and i use my adhd and clinical depression as an  excuse  to not do things and she threatened to take away anything that makes me happy. i said that hurt me because i m really struggling right now to which she responded  that s bullshit  and basically implied i m lying and looking for attention all the time. i m suicidal  she does not know that but she knows i have depression she went with me to get me diagnosed  and these instances just make me hate my life more and more. i think the only reason she says these things is because it s easier for her to say i m  lazy  than it is for her to admit i m extremely depressed and obviously suicidal.   but now after sitting in my room for a while and thinking about it i feel extremely impulsive. i wanna steal a car or run away. i have a huge test tomorrow that i was also supposed to study for today and i didn t  i wanna skip school and i ve never skipped school in my life never even got a detention. i just wanna break a law or destroy something or steal something and thinking about skipping school or running away or stealing my parents car or anything impulsive like this gives me a strong feeling of happiness and euphoria. like tingly euphoria excited feeling. like a natural high. i m not a violent person and i ve never broken a law in my life not even shoplifting but right now i guess because of my view of my life i feel i don t have much to loose anyway and i want that adrenaline rush. i just wanna feel alive again. i m tired of just existing and going to school and going to work. i wanna break free and do something stupid and reckless. i wanna get drunk or do coke or fight someone. i wanna know if anyone else feels like this after a really bad depressive episode or do i possibly have some type of personality disorder like bpd or bipolar    it feels like today i hit the lowest low of being trapped in my own mind and then shot up suddenly while sitting and crying to the highest high of feeling like nothing can stop me with extreme feelings of euphoria laughing and i can do whatever i want because nothing matters anyway but in a really dangerous way where i feel like i would make really bad choices. i also wanna include i started a very low dose of adderall around 2 weeks ago but have had really no bad side affects except for lowered appetite. i m putting this here because i don t know where else to say it. it s just kinda scary but in a very liberating way but i ve never felt this strongly happy or excited after a really bad depressive episode  normally i kinda just feel a little better or nothing at all.,2021-02-22 18:43:59

174668,i am in my late 20s and since graduating high school in 2012 i have isolated myself rarely leaving my house. there are achievements most people my age has accomplished that i have not. like i have never had job or had a girlfriend.   since i was a kid i have been very shy. when i was in school i would rarely talk and the teachers told my grandparents i had a learning disability and was a slow learner. i had no friends in school. most of my classmates would ignore me. sometimes i was called weird or homophobic slurs although i am not gay. i made bad grades in school because i didn t care. i am not a smart person. certain things i have trouble with like math and understanding what i read or watch.   i was raised by my grandparents. they was well meaning but overprotective. they never encouraged me to be social. during my childhood and teenage years i would just stay home all the time and watch tv or video games. my grandfather died when i was in middle school. certainly i live with my grandmother and my aunt and nether of them care about my situation.  i had a car when i was younger but didn t get a job because i am scared of people. now i wished i had forced myself to get a job.  my aunt works but she never offers to take me anywhere. i stay up all night watching things on my laptop and sleep most of the day.  i live in a rural area and there are no jobs close enough to walk to.  because i have isolated myself for so long i have bad social skills. i have a speech impediment that i am self conscious of. making eye contact is difficult for me  and i don t know what to say in social situations. i am very lonely and depressed. i have always wanted a girlfriend but i m really ugly and awkward.    i have been thinking about ending my life. you only live once and i have ruined my life.,2021-10-16 07:43:50

8649,tupperware can be so expensive it s actually ridiculous. you can go to costco and buy a tub of butter for less money than it costs for one tupperware of the same kind. now you ve got the container you need and some food to go with it.   all kinds of food comes in containers that you can just keep and use for all the same things you ll need tupperware for.   glass jars are perfect for sauces and dry noodles. butter tubs are perfect for leftover soups or stir frys.  if you order take out  a lot of restaurants nowadays even send their food,2021-10-23 19:06:09

58846,i m not really expecting any answers to this  i really just need somewhere to write down my thoughts. i m not really the kind of person to share my feelings with others  and i know this is why i feel so bottled up inside all the time. over the past few years everything that had once been a huge part in my life has slowly faded away from me. it seems that everything i do has no meaning  no gratification  not even the slightest amount of enjoyment. specifically these past few months have been the worst. i haven t been able to find anything new that is fun for me. i tried picking up new instruments  didn t help. i tried picking old hobbies back up  didn t help. the only thing that has brought the littlest spark in my life is that fact that i met this girl  but even when we talk my negative thoughts and doubts just overtake any other feeling that i have. my parents think i m a loser  they think i m lazy. i haven t told them about these feelings  in fact i don t tell them about anything. because i know that no matter what i tell them they ll think it s all just bullshit. they want me to be something i m not  but i don t even know who i am. i wish i had friends close enough to me that i could talk about stuff like this without joking around or being judged  i would talk about it with the girl but i don t want to ruin anything by bringing it up. sometimes i think too much about this stuff  blaming myself for this. i don t even know if these thoughts are real. am i forcing them on myself  do i actually have these problems  seems like i m just alone and empty for the time being. and i hate it. i hate this feeling. i hate these thoughts. i hate me. sorry for the messy post.,2020-08-24 00:25:46

202385, okay  okay  sometimes you   might   be overcome by something but it s only ever temporary because there s absolutely nothing that you  can t and won t get through.     even if that means taking the mightiest of breaks for space and grace.     even if that means crawling along slower than a snail s pace.     even if it means calling in all of the cavalry.     even if it means tapping into your crisis self care plan.     even it it means you stumble and cry and flounder your way forward and through.     the tough times are so tough and so painful and so resolutely insidious that we feel overcome by them from time to time  or  in worst cases  for a longer than we d like time.     the thing to remember though  is that you are always  always  always tougher than those tough times. without a shadow of a doubt.     toughness doesn t always grrr  it isn t always in the flexing of mental or physical muscles  more often than not it looks softer  more vulnerable  and it s more of a whisper that doesn t turn heads in the same way a roaring lion might. just because it doesn t turn heads  isn t loud  isn t roaring or racing through you  doesn t mean you don t have it by the bucketload.     you ve gotten through everything life has thrown at you until now. there s probably an ample list of things you thought weren t overcome able but you got through them   you tenacious so and so  you.     we can t always see the way through just like a car can t always see the road on a foggy day  but there is a way around   through   over   under whatever it is you re facing and you will find it. it s one of those  pay it forward  things that we wish we d been told on repeat.     we know you can get through this. we just do. one day  maybe not necessarily soon and definitely not quick enough  you ll look back on now and it ll be added to that  things i thought weren t overcome able  but were  list.     gentle hugs    amp  x200b   this is from the blurt team  lt 3,2022-01-26 23:00:57

43446,19y o male suffering from depression  social anxiety and generally just extreme introvertness.   one of my old extroverted freinds from high school  talked me into  going to a party with him. and with everything going on  i thought going out and meeting new people might be a good idea. maybe i could even stop feeling sorry for myself for cancelling out on life and start living a little. big mistake    before we even arrived at the party my freind tried to talk me into doing amfetamines with him. i said no a few times  but sadly i eventually budged.  after i took the first line  it soon became the 2nd  3rd  the 4th line. and all of the suddon i had taken about 9 10 lines of amfetamines along with huge amounts of vodka shoots and beer. everything being poured into to my system by what i thought was my freind.  i was in no position to say no at any time. and if it wasn t for his girl at the time saying no for me  i would ve probably been talked into taking a few more lines.   my brain was completely fucked the day after. and i had trouble understanding what the fuck was going on  along with extreme anxiety kicking in.  i got home feeling like shit and riddled with anxiety  while getting ready for my grandpa s birthday.   i regret doing this so much that even after 6 months  i constantly think about what could ve gone wrong. how stupid i was for always saying yes  just to please my freind.  i could ve easily died from an overdose. hell i think  i even had a minor stroke the day after.   ever since then  i ve been constantly panicking about what this might have done to my brain. am i ok  did i have a stroke that night  did i lose my last brain cell   yes .   even tho it s been so long i can t really talk myself into being in the clear  from the danger i was in. i mean if i ve had any serious problems like a stroke i m sure i would ve been dead by now.. right  but i still can t let go.   have anyone been through something similar  and what did you do to  let go     thanks for reading  and sry for poorly constructed sentences and grammar. i m running on brain fumes ..,2020-06-28 11:30:49
9615,given that the person is conscious and responsive.  for example  if you see an elderly gramp struggling to lift something out of their cart  ask in a clear tone if it s okay that you come closer to help them instead of walking towards them confident that they ll be okay with it.   same thing if there has been a medical emergency. example  if you witness someone fall on ice and is down on the ground  verbally ask if you can approach to ensure the person doesn t freak out seeing feet by his face all of a sudden.   with covid now  you never know how uneasy someone may feel by having a stranger approach them so closely.,2021-11-20 18:22:15

9070,if you are always cold at the office  consider an electric blanket over a space heater. they re less expensive and less likely to short out or cause a fire. also  unlike a space heater  it won t heat up the shared space around you  potentially making other coworkers feel too warm.   there s just something great about sitting down to start the day with hot tea and a warm bum.,2021-11-03 09:12:47

177664,i guess i did overreact a bit. the thing is  i found my purpose  but it s a double edged sword  on one side i get to be the absolute immutable and unconditional support to those i love  on the other side it s extremely difficult to apply. it sure as hell doesn t help my personal depression but it does achieve an old goal of mine  if i could rid the world of hurt by forever being the only one hurting  i would.  discrepancies in core values can be hard to deal with  especially if like me you re the most  self  restrictive. i was on a streak of bettering myself  succumbed to temptation and got exactly the reaction i would have expected. it took me 5 hours to remember how much i love that person and how that stuff shouldn t change that  that i should encourage it even.  my whole life i ve been the butt end of the joke  the one you can get anything from  the last thing people cared about. a few days ago i cut ties with my 3 best friends and a lot of those 2 circles because they wouldn t give me the time of day for years and i suspect they just wanted to get rid of me but couldn t for some reason.  i m done getting taken advantage of in any way imaginable  tired of healing and never being healed  tired of noticing other s problems and mine being overlooked. i don t think i m that great at hiding the pain  people in general just don t care at all.  life is cold  but the living are colder. you d think people wanting the world to be  a better place  would actually care for people  turns out it s always all a fa ade to hide behind. i don t do marketing  i don t do public image  i m me  i act like me  i think like me.  now i ll help people because it s the right thing to do  always has been. thank you stan lee for spider man and the words of wisdom engraved in the thought bubbles. showing that even if life hits hard and you reach your lowest  if you have the ability to do the right thing then you should feel the moral obligation to do it  with great power comes great responsibility.  it won t be easy  it won t help my problems  but when have i ever done any of those two things in my life. to being a genuinely good person in the future ,2021-10-26 17:39:35

148357,    gt if its too long don t read .ok this is so lame and desparate sounding. but i have some questions which i don t want to keep asking or to be thinking and wondering when i start to get better with my ocd. i have two questions. anyone who can give a good answer thanks. not just what i want to hear. but the truth. because i m not planning on asking these questions ever again. and i want to know the real consequences of this sin. its really important since it was singled out and i really want sound bible advice on this sin and the punishments if you know it . first on the blasphemy of the holy ghost. i did it like 5 months ago out of bitterness for my life.    gt     gt and as paul in the bible said that because many were bitter many be came defiled i think that s what he said. so when i realized i was angry at my life and was trying to do better. and i wasn t done with some habits i tried to promise god to quit. i still had no real joy in my life and i promised to give up things i loved. like certain music and foods. also i wasn t very nice. because i loved my family. but they like other things because of their judgements and the things they say to me  i tried to protect myself. so it could have both been bitterness and like ptsd and trying to avoid them and being tough and walking with a hard look and a stump so they wouldn t feel comfortable enough to try to speak to me.    gt     gt just to say some messed up useless stuff. which is harder for me to get over. mainly because i don t have any real friends or people who just like me. only my siblings and parents. i ve depended on them for a lot and that was where i went wrong. trying to make them love things about me they just hated  and they basically shuned me. for an example this may be tmi. but just to show some sick stuff my dad has bullied me about. once i had a pad. for periods. and you know not to flush them.    gt     gt so instead of like my mom she wraps it in the paper and puts it in a bag so it wont leak or anything and so u cant see it in the trash. now i was feeling bad and didn t want to get one. so i got like basically the whole roll of tissue and wraped my pad in it. now like in the next thirty mintues my dad was wodering where all the tissue went and freaking out. and he decided to look through the trash because he was trying to firgure out why it was all gone. and found a wad of tissue and then when seeing there was a pad init or it was bleeding through and then he like came out and asked if it was me.    gt     gt then i said yeah that s mine. he said it was disgusting and that he didn t want to see that. and then he grabbed me by the arm and like brang me in their mom and dads room and yelled at me. and like said it was gross and nasty and i looked at my mom and she was like what ever im tired of you  and then he ask what was wrong with my hair and i said my hair is fine. then he got a mirror and was mockingly like does this look done and laughing. then he said i d be shocked if i saw you in heaven. over a pad with blood that he went looking for in the trash.    gt     gt think he went and dug through the trash looking for shit. that s like me going and putting my hand in the toliet and finding shit and being shocked what did you expect you was gonna find doing that. so that s just a taste of what he does. trust me i don t always complain about every minor inconvenience. then i don t wanna be ew cause god is god and can say what he wants. but i have an older sister she s 24 and is kidna fast and she was a teen mom. and i kinda judged her tho i was only jealous of her cause dad loved her so much. like anytime my sister would come around i d love seeing her and my niece.    gt     gt more then all my siblings and mom. she s my half sister by the way  only one who loved seeing her more was my dad. so that being said i still was jealous of her and it totally wasn t her fault. now all this shit was in my head and i was bitter. and i kinda would take it out on my siblings not out loud but in my head. and i was angry at god and my family for weeks blasphemying and stuff being rude. and i decide to read the bible and then he had like passages for me cuz i blaspheymed and was trying so hard to be good. and then the bible had a passage about the virgins in israel doing a very horrible thing and saying as if it were a little thing they were more defiled then everyone idk.    gt     gt but also it had one about ahloa and her sister and i knew that was for me tho im not a whore. it was like this is the sins of your sister. and my golly that were totally describing my sister being a little fast eatting a lot and being pridful and kinda selfish. but then he said init she is better then you. like it said your sister is like in all she has done better then you  and for that momment it was like a badly written sitcom. you know like where the sad and depressed one keeps trying to show their good and better.    gt     gt and the other is care free and happy and doesn t care as much but some how ends up better then you and that s how this is god tried to paint me out to be this evil and envious person which sometimes i am. so that brings me to these questins like in my other post i don t like suprises i like to know things so i don t have to worry about them. i sont mind being told no im not peter. but thinking your gonna do or get something and then not is like not very good  and i know you guys are so much more wiser then me and read the bible more and listen so this is the question   this maraggie supper of the lamb is said only blessed are those which are called.    gt     gt and i hate being left out of stuff. tho my dad says some in heaven wont go  now like saul when he was rejected from being king because of his disobediecne. i just wanted to know since i called the holy ghost evil and also i um publicly tried to slander him in a sneaky way online if you look at my other post you ll see.. dose that hurt my chances like is there any bible verse to back this thought of mine up just asking. and that last one is as you all know this see i read something about like in the greek bible translation it was a novum testamentum graece and it said i do always let go the sons of men the sins and the blasphemy as much as it is blasphemyed but he who blasphemys against the holy ghost has not let go but is guilty of an eternal sin.    gt     gt so i also don t really want eteranal guilt so those are the only two questions thanks.   ,2021-07-13 16:50:03
57799,been struggling with mostly mild anxiety and depression most of my life. it s been tolerable for the most part and i ve just  lived with it . the past few months and last week specifically i ve hit a low with my mental health. i left my job last week to try something new. i didn t realize until my first training shift what i mess i am and how bad my mental health as gotten. i had an anxiety attack at the beginning of the shift with chills  shakes  and eventually threw up. i went home sick an hour and a half in. this was a completely different type of  job and i felt very outside of my comfort zone.  i told myself it was a fluke and that if i just make myself go and get used to it i ll be okay. for 2 days straight my mind was full of catastrophic thoughts and i had a few breakdowns  all at the thought of this new job  my future and just bringing myself to go in to my next shift. it was so bad that i would have anxiety attack after anxiety attack and i couldn t eat or sleep. 2 hours before my shift i let them know i wasn t coming in and that because of my mental health it s not working for me right now.  me and my fiance agreed i should see a doctor and get on some medication. i feel like i ve lost all control of my life and no matter what i do  i m unhappy. now my thoughts are just spiraling about how i  fucked up  by quitting this new job or how i m a failure and wasted everyone s time. my old job will take me back i m almost 100  sure but i feel like a fool coming back 1 week after quitting. i m just sick of not feeling like myself and this new level of intensity has finally gotten me to consider medication. have any of you had similar experiences and if you are on medication has it helped ,2020-08-19 22:44:18

8048,my  25f  best friend  27m  of 6 years and i have have recently taken space from eachother and i don t know how to feel  hey guys first time poster here  grab your popcorn cos this is a long one  i think this is the right forum to post in   my best friend and i started sleeping together after i mentioned to him i may be developing some feelings back in january  wasn t sure what kind of feelingsbut i shared with him because we are very open with eachother  and long story short he wasn t open to exploring as he had put all feelings of non platonicness behind him years ago and i ve also slept with two of his friends  which is fine by me. prior to me saying this though  so like past 5 years of friendship  i ve never looked at him other than a friend  i ve set up him up with some of my friends etc   i didn t have a problem with our set up because i was kind of having my cake and eating it. anyways because we were so close even prior to sleeping together  talk everyday  see eachother almost weekly  adding the extra stuff  kinda felt like a natural next step   we had already acknowledged like 4 years into our friendship  that if we ever got partners they probably wouldn t be comfortable with how close we are  how much we spoke etc so understood we d have to fall back when that time came   we have been sleeping together for 9 months  had a check in in august because he revealed he felt guilty as it s not right that we were sleeping together if he didn t feel the same way   i said although he should feel guilty because it s a bit suspect that he pursued me even though he didn t want to explore  i m fine with the situation because i didn t feel like it was that big a deal cos it s not like i was even sure of the feelings i had for him initially and i m having my cake  . we also acknowledged we weren t ready to give up talking or seeing eachother often so would just carry on asusual until one of us gets a partner or isn t happy with the situation   post our august chat things started feeling even more relationshippy than they had previously but for me it didn t doesn t go beyond us having the right inputs for a relationship because i know based on previous discussions  we d never be in an actual relationship. he messaged 2 weeks ago to say he s been thinking and he s not comfortable with how relationshipy our set up has been feeling of lateand it didn t feel right and would like some distance.  of course it didn t feel right because we re not in an actual relationship    anyways i could kind of sense this was coming  noticed a change in his behaviour  so i said i 100  support the decision for distance as it was going to happen at one point and we both need it because needless to say  the situation is a bit messy on paper. i also am interested in what changed because we acknowledged a very long time ago that our set up can feel relationshipy but i guess that s for him to work out as he said he couldn t put a finger on it  we haven t spoken for 2 weeks which has been very hard i won t lie but mainly because i miss my friend first. this time to reflect has been interesting for me because i am now realising how weird it is for someone to start sleeping with you if they genuinely see you as a friend so it s making me question whether he was ever actually my friend   just interested in people thoughts on this   first time poster  usually very in check with my emotions etc but the time apart has really thrown how i feel about him  the situation and i ultimately just want my friend back,2021-11-05 04:58:48
115174,parents are the worst ever. if it was just me i d say it s a rare thing but nearly all of my friends have terrible parents. my mom is.. okay.. ish  but my dad  gaslighting  arrogant  hypocritical manipulative motherfucker. he makes sure to always remind me and my sister how expensive we are. why did he even fuck our mom in the first place if he doesn t want to spend money on us   why buy us presents if he gets mad at us  we didn t ask for them  it was his idea to buy them. it used to feel like he has good intentions with bad execution but after my sister and another employee of his have been begging him to let them go   just sign a fucking paper   and him ignoring it makes me wonder if he s selfish deep inside.  he talks about how parents should be the number one people that you trust but everytime i share something with him  he betrays me. i told him about my social anxiety but even after my psychologist confirmed it he didn t take me seriously. you think only adults can have real problems  i should be glad as long as i am in school and not working  he has no idea what school is like. it s fucking hell for many people. teachers are assholes making us feel worthless and humiliate us  we have so many lessons a day that we are exhausted at the end of the day just like any other adult after work. but wait. our day doesn t even end there. after work you can go home and sleep but we have homework. every single teacher expects us to learn 3 hours from their subject  ignoring that other subjects exist and if we dare to try to enjoy our youth we are called lazy for not studying. don t even get me started on how toxic a class community can be.  then not long ago i came out to him and i thought we got closer to each other but he messed it up once again.  i can respect him without stopping saying fag  . just shut up. not to mention how ignorant he is and how he treats homophobia as something insignificant. he got mad at mom for not telling him earlier but if he wasn t so ignorant he d know that there are tons of teenagers living on the streets after being disowned. i wonder if he would be ashamed of me if his friends knew. or maybe even laugh at their stupid jokes.  and don t he ever dare to say again that the reason he doesn t pay mom what he owes her according to the law is because she didn t contribute anything to the house. i just wanted to spend more time with her as a child but he took that away from me. she asked him to let her stay home with me and my sis just for a single year to just try it out but no. he sent her to work for absolutely no reason even tho you have the same job as you had back then and he has a bmw and an iphone so don t fucking tell me we would ve ended up poor. i was so disappointed everytime my mom couldn t be with me because she either had to work or was already home but had to do all kinds of bullshit for school since she was a teacher and her boss doesn t know what it s like to have kids.   when me and my sis lived at his place  he would sometimes come home and argue with use for absolutely no reason. wreaking your anger at your children  best father ever 100 100. yes  there was a mess in the house sometimes  but i don t know how we are supposed to be motivated to clean the house when he doesn t commend us for doing so. when my sister spent her whole day cleaning the house he never even said  good job  to her. but when he found the smallest imperfection  he immidiately started yelling at her.  we tried to talk to him for years but it s no use. he s too arrogant to realize his mistakes.  i d rather live in this small house with my sister and my mom which is barely enough for 2 people than move back in with my dad in his big house.  and then there s the parents of my friends.  one of my friends was not a planned child and  well what do you know  they treat her like crap. like use a fucking condom if you don t want another child. they often call their own child a bitch and slap her. she literally has something in her head that might be a brain tumuor and they refuse to take her to a doc.  another friend of mine is constantly blamed for everything. her stepmom is rude as hell to him and his dad is like  the way you treat her is not ok  like dude it is her that treats him like crap. but she treats his dad like crap too and his dad is like   the love of my life . and his biological mom  a narcissistic piece of crap. he told her about his traumas and she acted like he was overreacting. she abused him mentally for years and when he moved to his dad s place she called him a monster.  the parents of another friend of mine constantly blackmail him into going to church. his mom starts crying everytime he disagrees with her and her dad gets super mad. they alaways emotionally manipulate him to do whatever they want.  there are sooo many people in the world who should not be allowed to have any children.,2021-03-09 10:28:26

5854,hey everyone   i hope you are all enjoying the festive period    i d like to gather some opinions on which meditation practice you ve used to prevent mind wandering  and just to help prevent falling into general unconscious habits and thinking in your day to day life.   i assume most people will say mindfulness  but i ve practiced mindfulness for years and haven t really noticed much difference in my day to day life. i ve also tried tm style mantra meditation  and although extremely relaxing  found the same.   does anybody gage any suggestions  i m living life so unconsciously. i was wondering if  concentration  meditation may help  but i m not experienced in this.   any help or guidance appreciated  ,2021-12-28 07:14:07

120670,being able to find a girlfriend who would eventually be my wife  starting a family and living with them is the only scenario in which i see happiness as a possibility. but it s impossible for me. there s nothing i can do to look decent. i m short and ugly  i m 21 and i m going to be bald by 23 and my bodybuilding genetics are absolutely pathetic so i can never have a nice body. all i can think about is wanting to kill myself. i don t see a way out. i just have to die and that s it. over 3 years of this shit killing me on a daily basis and it s just gotten worse. not even a friend i can talk to about it so i resort to posting here. what the fuck can i do in this situation besides die,2021-04-05 17:47:16
198791,sorry in advance  this is kind of a rambling  anxiety filled word vomit.  i m kind of a loner  and the one friend i do really talk to suggested i reach out here. i ve been going through a lot lately. 6 months ago my significant other left with our child. she has commitment issues and i have abandonment issues. i was basically so sure she was going to leave that i spent 4 years convincing her if she should. our son s 4 years old now. we ve been separated ever since but kind of inactively trying to work on ourselves and work on things and spending time together. i have separation anxiety and abandonment issues due to a very troubled past. these last 6 months have been some of the hardest of my life  which really saying something  and i finally asked her to make a commitment one way or the other. either actively try to fix things or give up so that i know what to do.   she needs time and space to heal. she s not really battling her own demons yet and the way she needs to. she s taking on a lot and advanced her life in a lot of ways. but she s not doing the personal work she needs to in order to fix things. i on the other hand have been working my ass off to get my s    under control. most the time i do okay. but when my anxiety spikes i feel absolutely worthless and i have a hard time doing anything. this happens most often when i try to talk to her about things.  when i asked her to make a commitment  she asked for more space and time to think. her anxiety peaked as soon as i brought it up. we are very triggering of each other s issues  but i love her and i support her and i really want this to work out. i eventually plan to enroll myself in therapy  but i just started a new job and don t have insurance yet. for the time being i m looking for support. anyone that can check in on me and make sure i m doing okay. i probably won t be  but checking in will help. i was very vague in this post  if anyone would like to get into details  i m open to talk more. just someone without a support system reaching out to try and build one.  tia everyone,2022-01-12 18:38:51
134370,so this is my second rant in less than 10 minutes  this has nothing to do with the first one tho so if for some reason you do want to read this one  you don t have to read the other one.   okay so i really only have one well technically three  reasons to be alive and those three are my dogs. i just love them so much. but at the moment the reason to die are really starting to overpower the good    here are some of the reasons why live just sucks and i m constantly sad      school is going terribly  it is so stressful i really wish i didn t take ib. everyone says ib is impossibly hard to do well in and now i believe them. sadly although i say i ve given up on school i don t think i could just get a pass considering anxiety and expectations to do well.    when i m not thinking about how school sucks  i m hung up over a guy i dated a year ago who i didn t even know i liked that much until i started thinking about the relationship and missing it cause i was just too awkward  inexperienced and anxious to make any moves or behave as if i was in a relationship    home life kinda sucks  my mum is drunk quite a lot and like i really don t like talking to her when she s drunk which means i spend days in the same house as her without saying more than a few words typically just answering questions     slightly going back to the school thing   i have so many exams at the moment i m like so close to breaking    also thinking about my future the only thing that makes me happy is acting  however that s pretty hard to make a living out of unless you become big which i mean that s even harder. also i would never be able to cause like asian mum.    i feel like a few years ago when my dad passed  i pushed my friends away cause of wanting to be sad and alone but now although i feel like i know quite a lot of people  i don t really have a really close friend.   anyways there s my rant. reddit is also like the only place where i express my feelings so...yeah,2021-05-24 13:10:39
182400,my friend just lost her ex boyfriend. he was manipulative  abusive  and she broke up with him. but then he died and now she s upset and grieving. she s saying it s her boyfriend now and it s her fault. i m not really a empathetic person  and i give her space.  but it s been a while and we don t really speak any more. i also work with her  and she just sits there and makes me do all the work. i know she s lost someone close to her but i guess i had a hard time trying to understand how she still loves someone who treated her like that. but yeah. i m a bad friend. i m even considering getting a new job because i just don t want to be around her anymore. i know i suck. i m dealing with my own depression and anxiety right now and i m already started to push everyone away. a part of me is starting to dislike her. but i know she is grieving . maybe i really am a bad person.,2021-11-11 14:40:38
3964,peace is always  here and now  https   www.reddit.com r here now    but the mind can t live in the present. it always sees the present moment as a step to get to a better moment  to the future  which never comes . life is always now and peace is always here  but as long as you re identified with the mind  you ll always be trying to get  there   because the mind lives for the future.    one of the things i ve learnt on my journey is that  everything is fine  https   www.youtube.com watch v hb mdjhzxmw   no matter how it may seem. meditating more often and living more consciously to this realisation deeper and i realised that everything has actually always been fine  i just couldn t see it because identification with the ego was distorting my perspective on reality.,2021-08-29 06:36:45
59020,i am the stupidest and ill fated person in the world. technically  i should have died years ago  but my will to live and start afresh made me survive. and that was a big mistake. i should have just ended the pain.,2020-08-24 16:53:23
24270,i started a diary today for the first time. the first thing i wrote in it was that it is so hard to believe that my boyfriend of 1.5 years loves me. i find it impossible to believe it but i m trying so hard to trust that he does and that i m worthy of it. he s my first boyfriend to ever love me. half ways through my diary entry me and my boyfriend had a phone call and we argued and i hung up on him. he was falling asleep as i talked to him  which often happens. but it bothered me worse than normal this time because i gave him oral this morning  right before he had to leave for work. whenever he has to leave directly after sexual contact i get deeply depressed and it brings up deep issues. i just really needed to talk to him and feel loved and connected to him. so when he was falling asleep after asking how i was doing i got really upset and just hung up on him. after that he texted me saying  this isn t working . i called him and asked what isn t working. he said everything. he said everytime he talks to me i make him feel like shit. to hear that made me feel...beyond depressed. there s no word. i feel like i ll never be loved because all i do is drag everyone else down and make them pay for my issues. every day is something new with me. we fight constantly  and it s always because of some deep seeded issue of mine. he s too kind to me and always tries to understand that my behaviour comes from a dark lonely place inside of me  but at what point and am i just hurting him and making him a part of my pain          i just feel like giving up. i feel like i ve hit my wall. i want to be anybody else on the planet but me. the truth is that i will never be loved. i will never not be broken. i am filled with so much weakness and am a tangled mess of issues. i went to therapy for a while  i even went in debt for it  and i m pretty sure even my own therapist gave up on me. sometimes i think i have borderline personality disorder. i know i shouldn t stigmatize or shame it  but thinking i have bpd drives me into deep depression. i don t want advice on figuring out if i have it or learning to accept it. i know a lot about it  i just can t tell if i have it or if it s just trauma or emotional immaturity or what.       anyways. i m going to break up with him tomorrow. after 1.5 years of feeling unworthy of love  of trying to trust he can love me  i m finally going to give up. he deserves better. i couldn t hate myself more than i did at the moment he told me he feels like shit everytime he talks to me. he s all i have in this world and i have poisoned him. i have no close friends  i could  but i have no desire   my family is broken and i only speak with my mom  i have no job i care for or money to go to school. all i have is him  and i ve loved him so much that i lost myself in the promise of love in return.        i can t fall asleep tonight  all i m doing is crying. i wish i could go back to when we first met and start over again.,2020-04-23 04:12:07
10180,this has worked for me with larger companies in the us  verizon  bank of america  capital one etc . the second you mention any type of illness they usually back right off and waive the fee.  i m not saying i make a habit of this but i certainly don t feel bad about it. they use every loophole in the system to save money  why shouldn t we ,2021-12-06 21:42:18
7353,i really don t know where to start. i m supposed to enjoy college  after all i m studying in a field i thought i enjoyed my whole life  but i m not enjoying it. i don t like the homework  i don t like the lectures  i m a chronic procrastinator who tries to avoid work or responsibility at every turn  i have no self control and i don t really want to deal with it anymore.  i don t have a job. i don t want a job. i don t want to be creative and make cool things anymore. as much as i would love to be involved with my community and make a contribution to the world i live in  i m too lazy and it s just too much work.  the worst thing is  i don t want to get better. i don t want to help myself. i don t want to  succeed  in life anymore because i know it will require work that is more excruciating than i have the energy to handle. i don t want anything. all i want is to escape life and not exist anymore. that s all i ever really wanted anyway. there s no hope for me.,2020-02-23 15:32:23

95406,this is going to be an unconstructed vent  because i can t contain everything for long  so i apologize.  i don t even know where to start. i ve been so numb lately i can t even hold my thoughts long enough to write them down and when i try  they just seem to slip further away. i literally can t think during some times. i m very lonely. i have a family  siblings   parents  but live on my own  but i ve never been close enough with them to talk about anything serious. so that somehow makes me feel even more alone. i have lost touch with all my friends and i only have people at work but none of them are really friends. there s nobody to talk to. i have tried but all it does is make the listener awkward and trying to move on to another subject. i crave for human contact  just anything that makes me feel i m anything to anyone. everyone i know seem to have a decent life with goals and people around them. someone to trust and to lean on. a future. i m just nothing  i don t matter to anyone and i can never find happiness in myself  i need people. loneliness just kills me. the one positive thing in my life is my job and even that is ending now. because of the famous fucking virus i m losing my job and i have to wake up in 5 hours to the last day there. after that it s just darkness. no light in my future. the one thing where i could talk with people and forget about my hollow  lonely  miserable and unjoyful life. everyone there seems to think i m just a joyful  kind and funny guy who s always smiling at work and is so cheerful  because i genuinely loved that job and was better there   but they have no idea that when ever i m not there i m just sitting in my apartment  consuming meaningless youtube videos or something and feeling that dull ache of despair in my chest just waiting so i can go to sleep but not actually being able to sleep. i have no intentions of killing myself because i don t want to do that to my family  the only people i love.  in conclusion  i shouldn t exist and i don t want to exist. there is no point in me being here. all i am is just one more addition to the global overpopulation issue. i m not helping anyone  though i m not hurting anyone to my knowledge either. nobody needs me in their life and i m so fucking lonely and maybe i deserve it. honestly the best i can describe this is that i m just an empty shell. i m a turtle shell with the turtle dead and gone from the inside.  i m sorry if i wasted your time by making you read this ramble. also... thank you. for someone to read through that wall must mean someone was for once interested enough in something i do.,2020-12-29 15:46:43
175561,ps sorry for bad grammar im not a native speaker.  i m 19 f  and i think i have depression  but i don t want to assume things like this when i m not being diagnosed yet. since i was a child i usually cut myself if i was too angry or sad and dont know how to deal with my feelings. but things just gets worser after my dad died  and how my family keeps on pressuring me to become better and a good child  i m a stubborn person when it comes to hearing people advice   and that they dont want me to regret if my mom died because of me being a nuisance. i got tired easily and my laziness is just become worser so my mom always nagging at me to be more productive and that she needs me to listen to her well or she will get sick easily and die. she keeps on mentioning how she would die if im not listening to her.  i got tired of hearing things like that and with my exams coming up  i just lose focus and cant study at all.   i easily become bored with something i really like to do and just scrolling to my phone a lot. i cried a lot every night and i always wanted to tell my family that i m not being myself  but i m afraid they just told me off with some shit like youre just in a rebellious phase of being a teenager. i am not good with sharing my feelings to my family because i know that if i told them my problems they will just say i m not praying enough to god. and about cutting myself  its just become much more worser and i cant stop  it helps me calming myself when im crying. i told my friend about how i cut myself and she scolds me for being weak and that other people had it worse  but still didnt cut themselves. i felt guilty feeling like this and maybe i am just looking for attention and this is just a phase of growing up. i want to seek medical help but im still living with my mom so going to the hospital is hard  plus i dont have any money. but again  when im with my friends im able to have fun with them  just that i m didnt feel that happy anymore. sorry for the long rant its in the middle of the night,2021-10-19 11:42:20
566,i m writing  amp  illustrating a guided journal on meditation  amp  self reflection.  in learning to meditate  most of the time   people either read books or listen to teachers  etc.  to inspire and direct themselves. what i would love to hear from you all is      what is a kernel of wisdom you ve been given in regards to meditation that just  clicked  for you      i m curious  since we all have different makeup and experiences  what different pieces of advice or teachings made it  make sense   if even only for a moment.  thank you in advance ,2021-02-26 16:35:07

19102,i ve struggled with my mental health my entire life. it s never gotten better nor do i ever foresee it improving. i actually find it quite patronising when people say  keep going  you will get better one day  etc. firstly  there s no way they could definitely know that. secondly  do all of the people suffering and subsequently commit suicide   get better  .   i feel betrayed by most of those closest to me  and the few people i still have around in my life are a constant reminder of the burden i am. they always say i am not a burden  but i can see it on their faces  in their eyes  in the way they talk. when you are miserable  you make those who care about you miserable. i don t find any activity  or any person in my life  to bring me any form of happiness. i don t trust anybody. i don t feel any sort of connection with anyone. i m too scared to even try  as every single time i have  it s been thrown back in my face via a variety of means  cheating  being called ugly not good enough  being replaced in my old friendship group by the same girl who did these things to me  unfortunately  many more and worse examples then these . i ve completely lost sense of who i am. i don t enjoy anything. i don t look forward to anything. i m 23 years of age  supposed to be in the prime of my life  and instead i see myself as a total failure for not achieving goals i set myself. one of the main reasons i want to die  is so i don t have to suffer living like this for  potentially the next 60  years. i ve tried therapy  meds  but nothing. i m waiting again on more therapy  but with covid etc  who knows how long that will take  how am i supposed to survive in the meantime  i spend most of the waking day thinking about how much i hate myself. about how much i hate the current state of my life. about how i want to punish myself for these things. sometimes i starve myself for days  i don t sleep  cutting etc. i have attempted a few times and i couldn t even do that right. my biggest fear is botching the next attempt and ending up not being able to finish the job. if we had access to guns in this country  there is a 0  chance i would still be alive today  as after researching 100 s of methods  this would definitely be my preferred choice.   surely it s better  to end the pain and suffering now  rather then have it drag on for years  torturing my family by being completely miserable constantly. it will hurt them. i know it will effect them forever  but once the shock is over  they can begin to heal. if i m alive  constantly dragging them down  healing is impossible. when i die  the world will carry on turning. they will move on and put me to the back of their mind.,2020-04-03 20:33:03
1073,so this pandemic has made me pretty lonely  so i m just looking for anyone to talk to. i m a 21 year old male from the netherland. i love talking about anything but my hobbies are    playing guitar   listening to music    share perspectives on life   architecture urban development  i ve been in a relationship for 4 years  so i m not looking for anything like that. i d just like to talk to someone.   ,2021-04-01 04:58:17
180363,i m 23f severely depressed  all i want is to die. me and my twin sister did everything for my mum  help her with every single thing she needs help with. we are just a servant for her and for our youngest sister  17   i have a full time job as a registered nurse and that s embarrassing for her. she hides food from me just to give it to my youngest  she ask my youngest if she likes my clothes so my mum and take it for her  he berates us to my youngest   dont put too much makeup like your older sisters  look at how disgusting they look without makeup    she buys 1 item just for my youngest and never buy and buy anything for me and my twin  she buys food that are expensive for my youngest and buy the cheap ones for us  when she brings home food and says        name  i bought this for you . we do everything but why cant be get love like that  filling out my youngest sisters forms are always us  applications is always us  just bc she  doesnt know how to do it . recently we have been fighting back and told our mum to make our sister do it herself since shes nearly an adult. when we call my parents out  raise our voices  do anything that doesnt fit them  they say hurtful things but when mu youngest do that  she never gets in trouble.   but when we want to move out it  we ll kill you first and then you can move out    friends are toxic  family are toxic. life will probably be better without me bc i was just born as a servant or born just to turn into one for our youngest. idk how long i will be in this world  but i know i wont give up. theres not a day where i m happy for a full day. life is sad ,2021-11-04 13:30:44
1970,sometimes when i reach a meditative state  i forget how to breathe. and when i go to breathe  it pulls me out of that special space.  if anyone has any advise on how to overcome work through this  i would appreciate your input.,2021-05-15 16:56:53
558,so this is situational and won t always work. but it ll give you ammunition when you re bargaining for something.  call up or if it s in person ask a friend to come in and ask what the best price for the item is if you were to bulk order them or if you wanted to be a reseller.  once you know their best price you call them or come in and negotiate towards that price for just the single item. if the person is desperate for a sale or just not in the mood to haggle and wants an easy sale or they feel like you know what you re doing  because you know how much they can be sold for it looks like you ve done your research   they ll more likely give it to you at a lower price.  another thing to point out. alot of people don t realise how often you can ask for a better price when shopping for things like electronics  and if you re nice about asking for it  often the sales person will give it. i work in sales and i enjoy giving discounts away as long as i can justify it with my manager later.  the person really knew how much to ask for and said they d go ahead if i agreed  is an easy justify for me,2021-02-23 20:05:04
66470,i am 24 years old and i have been told over and over that i am a daydreamer  forgetful and that i don t use my brain. honestly it really hurts because i don t do it on purpose. i try really hard to be less forgetful and self aware. when people tell me this  i feel like i am really dumb or that i am mentally disabled.   relatives and friends have gotten angry at me for not being able to do simple tasks properly. for example  i had a fight with my cousin a week ago  because he was teaching me how to drive and i struggled with the car key ignition. he screamed at me and accused me of not using my brain and that normal people would know how to do it. and you know what  i know that s true and i m very ashamed at myself that i struggle with these basic tasks that is easy for everyone. maybe i m just ignorant but i truly did not do it on purpose.   i am less forgetful and uncoordinated than before  i try really hard to improve but feel discouraged when people comment that i am dumb. i do well in university and my job but it s the little things that i struggle at such as sometimes being careless with my belongings  forgetting where i put my wallet  in my house . i also seem to take things literally and overanalyse words spoken by people. i don t do these things on purpose...i feel so helpless. the thought of this being permanent in my life  something i can t change or why i even need to work twice as hard to do normal things  makes me feel suicidal because i feel like if this is true  i am mentally disabled and will be treated badly and looked down by the people i love.   i guess i m asking if others also experience this and if anyone managed to change this and become completely unforgetful coordinated self aware.,2020-09-22 15:43:19
84273,i thought about making a throwaway account for this but i m over it. i m done feeling like i have to hide that i struggle  done feeling  less  because of it and i m  so  done with feeling like this is some kind of character flaw. this is not who i am  this is what i struggle with.     please be aware that there s mentions of abuse  sexual and physical violence and suicide.    i ve been struggling with mental health issues ever since i can remember. i was raised in a disfunctional environment  first tried to kill myself at the age of six  drank daily by the age of ten  did drugs  stole  skipped school and eventually it got bad enough for me to drop out of school and spend my teenage years isolated.  when i was a child  i was told i was making those around me sick  that i was nothing but trouble. i was assaulted and was told that  boys will be boys  when i asked for help  was threatened to have my arms broken and my door knocked down with an axe to kill me by those that were supposed to protect me. i remember not being allowed to play to not mess up the house and when i went to clean it instead  i had to watch my mother just do it again. nothing i did was ever good enough.  i remember begging my parents to  de marry  after listening to them fight while hitting my head against the walls to drown them out at the age of four. i had to watch my mother being beaten black and blue by my father  calling out for my help just to return to him  because of   me     and drink herself senseless after her affair had left her. i was told they d drop me off at an orphanage by my parents every change they had and when i eventually begged them to do so  i was called ungrateful  selfish  spoiled.  i remember praying to simply not wake up again when i was little. i remember praying  to just be  normal  when i was a little older and when that didn t happen  i wished to someday get  so sick that finally people would have to care of me    but when i got sick  i was told that i should be happy it wasn t cancer.  i spent my teenage years locked into my tiny room  isolated  alone and without help. the only thing that got me through this was the sheer fucking refusal to let this happen to anyone else. if i couldn t save myself  i d do everything in my power to prevent others from having to experience what i had to experience. i went back to school trying to get into a position to allow me to do so.  along the way i lost my dad. i always tell people that i moved back home when my dad got sick to take care of him. truth is  i moved back home because life had been crushing me for a while already. he lasted a year  spent three months of it ventilated in a coma and never really made it back. he came home for one last christmas and when the time came to decide between ecmo or death  i chose the latter.  he died because nothing ever was enough for you  his parents later told me.  you are responsible for me now  were my mother s only words the day he died. i ve always been responsible. for everything and everyone.  i tried to push on and finished school. then i was raped. he was known to have assaulted people before. nobody told me.  you have to report him  else you will be responsible if he does this to anyone else . i did   and he went after me after. i left town.  i tried to push on and got into uni when my body stopped working. i found out that the intense physical symptoms that had made me drop out of school during my teens and that had been brushed off as  anxiety  by healthcare professionals way too many times were actually two chronic illnesses. i got treatment and surgery   15 years too late.  i tried to push on and got into med school and for a second i thought i had found my  happy ever after . lectures were torture  life was hell and i was thinking about suicide more than about food but these tiny moments where i was with patients were the happiest i had ever been. this is what i had always wanted to be  what i was born to do  raised to do  my place  my home. a place where my past was not a flaw but a powerful tool.  you don t have to hide from me  i won t judge you  i m way more broken than you  i just want to help    and they knew.               i used to call it  running into the hurricane  and was warned that it would kill me eventually. honestly  it was what kept me alive. i m not good with standing idle  i can t just sit there and watch while those around me suffer. i am responsible   i act.  protect yourself first    but a hurricane does not care about your boundaries  about what is healthy and what is not. a hurricane requires people that are willing to save those inside of it and aim straight ahead. i am not afraid of running into the hurricane   and nothing inside of it is scarier than standing idle on the outside. i have seen it  been raised in it and am broken enough to know that i have nothing to lose. now  i was inside the hurricane. i was home. for once in my life  i was not misplaced  i was right where i belong  a place where normal people can t survive for too long. the monster in the middle of the hurricane.  yet outside of the hurricane  life was hard   and then  somewhere along the way  i just couldn t do it anymore. i had spent my life trying to prove them wrong  afraid of people seeing how messed up i really am  of them turning away  of them validating everything that had happened to me. i had refused to be remembered a monster   until i just didn t.  i went back to therapy and was asked to decide  do i want to move ahead and work on building a future  and accept that struggles will always be a part of this  or do i want to  wait it out   spend my life waiting for death and go back into isolation    choose your struggle .  death has always been part of my life. i d never thought i d make it to 15  now i ve made it past twice that age. i ve worked hard on myself  been in therapy more times than i can count and i m alright with my past nowadays. i ve accepted that there s no use in feeling anger or resentment  in feeling sorry for myself or searching for someone to blame because it wouldn t change the fact that those things happened. i m not chasing some  happy ever after    some magical tomorrow where there s a world without hardships   anymore because that d be just setting myself up for disappointment. life will always have its ups and downs and that s alright and though i might ve hit bullshit bingo in some aspects  i can t hold onto this if i ever want to have the chance at moving on. i ve learned to set boundaries and how to enforce them  have learned to let go of the thought of being responsible for everyone and everything  of even being  able  to save everyone.  i thought that i had chosen life but the deeper we dug  the more obvious it became  it s not what had happened to me that is destroying me  it s me.  i do believe them. to this day  i do believe that in the deepest of my core  i am irreparably broken. i grew up in this weird void of not having a future while also not having an exit. the monster that was set to save them all just to make amends for its existence that wasn t allowed to exist but also wasn t allowed to not exist. i am the hurricane.  therapy has taught me to reflect  to draw the circle of perception around myself closer and closer  to not look for answers in others but in myself  and suddenly i knew  life is still hard not because of the things that had happened or were still happening. life is hard because of me. this time  i actually am responsible. i am what is making me sick. it doesn t matter who started it  it s on me to stop it   and i can t.    choose your struggle     i did  30 years ago. and i can t let go. 30 years ago i chose  the coward s suicide  where life is not an option but suicide is out of reach. i spent my life hiding  isolated  overwhelmed and frozen  waiting for it all to finally be over while also not having the guts to kill myself.   i chose death but stayed alive   and now there s nothing.   i realize that this is what s holding me back  that it s on me to make an active decision towards life but i just can t. i don t want to fight for some  imagine yourself in 20 years  future  i don t need to prove anyone wrong anymore because i ve realized that i am exactly who they thought i am   who i think i am. i am deeply broken. i ve spent my life hiding  trying to cover up the shatters  trying to be good but after a lifetime of marinating in this bullshit it would take me another lifetime to at least get back to zero. i m tired. i truly do believe that every life is valuable and that there s almost nothing that can t at least be improved but i also think that unfortunately  sometimes there are just tragic combination of genetics and environment that make  staying alive at all costs  just not the most humane decision.  yes  life has its beautiful moments and there s joy in the little things but to me  none of those are worth the pain in between. i know that it might not be too late to change my path but deep down inside of me  was i given the choice between my  perfect future  and just ending it all with a snap  i d choose the latter.  when i told my therapist  they dumped me   and that s ok. i absolutely do agree with what they did  with what they said and how they handled the situation.  i ve tried to convince myself to keep on going because  you won t end it anyway  so get your shit together  and when that didn t work  i tried to convince myself to finally pull the trigger. i m still here.  how do i get out of this  how am i supposed to make a decision when i just simply can t  i never meant to deceit anyone  i really thought that i had chosen to live but i just can t. i can t move on  can t leave this void but if i don t  life will always remain this unbearable thing that just keeps demanding more and more of things i ve never had.  i m stuck. not every story has a happy ending and as sad as this is  it s alright. i just wish that i could finally make up my mind and turn the page.,2020-11-26 19:34:13
9160,i have an interview next week for a new job  but at the sametime i ve heard back for my testing for the military in a couple weeks.   should i let the new job know i ve applied and in the process for the military or say absolutely nothing until it s confirmed that i ve been accepted by the army   i know the process can sometimes be quick and sometimes slow with the military. i don t want to put the new job in an awkward position either.,2021-11-05 17:38:08

3912,for me personally  i already have a lot of things going on at any given moment and struggle with anxiety. instead of saying  hey we need to talk  and refuse to give any context  say  hey when you get a chance i d like to talk to you about x  or  hey later on i ve got a couple questions about y . if people would let me know what needs to be discussed  i would have a better chance to have an intelligent discussion as opposed to entering the situation already on edge.  edit  damn. went to sleep with 10 updoots  woke up with 25k and a ton of awards. thank you all for the internet points  random strangers. hopefully this is 25k fewer people that needlessly give someone crippling anxiety,2021-06-15 14:18:01
2346,i ve hit my lowest. this happens every year. i get into a binge drinking frenzy and ativan binges as well. i even combine them sometimes which i know is very dangerous.  i was once on lexapro and when i came off the withdrawal was so bad i told myself i ll never take another pill. i had the most intense brain zaps and flu like symptoms. i was constantly throwing up and couldn t get out of bed. it took me 2 weeks and i still didn t feel right the rest of the month and that was just on 10 mg.  years later i ve realized i can t control myself with seasonal depression. i drink everyday out of depression constantly take ativan. i ve come to terms that i am in fact at my lowest and need help.  my doctor recommended wellbutrin for me he says it s side effects are very minimal and it can help with my cigarette smoking as well.  i wanted to see if anyone could share wellbutrin with drawl as i don t want to be on it forever. i d just like to take it for the winter season.,2020-02-08 11:19:30

161259,reason 1  i need to move on from my favorite places  have you ever been in a place where you don t want to be. i feel it right now  i moved on from my favorite place and i liked that place a lot  i don t want to move from that house because that house has a lot of memories from my entire life. i spent 19 years in that house but because of financial problem my family have so i need to move out because my family can t afford the money anymore. it s been 4 months since that and i don t even feel comfort to live here  maybe because this house didn t have a lot of room so i don t have my own room doing something private and have a quality peace time with myself. i need to share bedroom with my whole family here and i don t like it because now i can t talk with my friends in a middle of the night without someone interrupting and tell me to shut up. i don t like to interact with my family members and because this house is small so i don t have a choice  i always miss my me time because it gives me a time to reflect and think about my life  what i want to do and what i really don t want to do. i don t even have my own room to do my work assignment right now  don t have a place to study  or playing with my friends in the night. and i no longer can play together with my irl friends. if i could trade my entire life so i could live in that place again for 1 day it s more than enough for me.  reason 2  my family financial problem  i know it s cruel for me to say this but i hope i was born in a different family  in a family where i don t need to be worry about moving out from your favorite place  where i can study about psychology and not where i forced to study something else because i can t afford it  where we don t need to fight because money. i want a family like that  people say money can t buy happiness but the things that keep me feeling sad is because money. i always feel envy for a lot of people who can laugh and don t care about money at all  i know it s really cruel for me to say this but i wonder why my parents think it s good to have a lot of child when you don t have the money for your child  do parents think their child will be grateful born in a family like this. my parents always said try to understand how their feels  but are they trying to understand how i feel  why can t i just be like another child that can become what they want  my mom always told me that i am just ungrateful but i always feel like it s hard to be grateful when all i feel is sadness.  reason 3  lost someone that i love              have you ever lost someone that you love because you can t be that cool or worthy person to stand beside him her  long ago i have a girlfriend that i think the only one who can understand me  i always feel insecure that i am not worth for her or you can say that she deserve a better guy than me  because i don t have anything like a cool motorcycle or a car  i can t even drive her home or to a places that she want to go but she accept me and every time i tell her that i am not worthy for her  she always said that she love me for who i am and i just need to try to love myself. but we broke up  at first she said she just feel bored from our relationship and i know that she is lying  because when you know someone for a long time you will know when they are lying. she tells me the truth that her parents didn t like our relationship because i can t be the cool guy for her and every time she talk about me her parents always ask when will we breakup. she said  i want to be like another girl that every time i talk about my boyfriend my parents always support me  not ask when will i end this relationship   this line always break my heart every time i remember it. i always blame myself for the end of my relationship with her  if only i could the cool guy who have anything and can give her anything i don t need to lose her  it still haunts me to this day and i keep dreaming about my ex it s been a year since that  the feeling of guilt for the things that i can t do for her and now i don t feel worthy for any love is still haunts me to this day  i hate myself and sometimes i think about suicide but i can t do that because nothing will change if i commit suicide it will just give another sad story to everyone that cares about me and i don t want to make anyone cry. so i just keep the feeling myself and i feel happy every time i dream about her even is not real but i feel happy to the things happening in my dream. i can see me and her smiling and laughing together again talking about nothing important and just expressing our love to each other  i miss the old times.  reason 4  i think i need someone to understand me  maybe the reason i always feel sad because i always keep my feeling deep down inside and never talk to anyone about how i feel. i tried to talk about how i feel to my mom or my family member and they always respond like someone else is having it worse  you are just ungrateful  you are just overreacting. i think no one trying to look from my perspective and understand how i feel  maybe i just need someone to understand about how i feel. i think i need help from someone that understand me  but the only person who understand me just left me and i don t have anyone else. i don t want to talk to my friends about how i feel because it feels awkward and i don t think my friends can understand me better because i know them for a long time. life isn t only revolve around me  thanks for reading this until the end and sorry for my bad english  because english isn t my first language.,2021-08-28 05:16:22
3445,so throughout school  currently last grade  i have had friends but as of now it seems they have brushed me to hang out with cooler people and i don t get invited to the social gatherings that they are in. whenever i meet someone new in public they seem to think i m cool so i don t know whether it s just apart of being a teenager and school,2021-06-28 00:46:22

187071,back in like late september  i finally told my dad i wanted to seek a professional. i told him that i want to try and get a diagnosis  then from there maybe get prescribed a medication and get a therapist of my own. i ve so shitty for so long but i only brought it up now because he has also told me he s getting help and that i can tell him anything. fast forwards to like a month  i ve heard nothing and so i work up the courage to ask him about it again. he says he didn t know what system i wanted to go through  the state or the va  so i tell him and he says he ll make a call.   nothing. i know it takes a while for things like this to go through and i m extremely privileged to even be able to go through this process but to just have to wait  when i know i m in a horrible place mentally. i have terrible mood swings  i let things that aren t going to matter next week effect me and how i function.  i want to ask my dad again but i don t want to be a burden.  he sends me podcasts  articles  all these things that i don t want. i m sorry if that s mean but i can t take it anymore . i wish he stopped acting like he knew what i am going through because he doesn t. he doesn t understand how fucking shitty i feel on a daily basis  about myself  how i act  why i can t talk to people easily. i m so tired.,2021-11-28 03:59:32

15591,i don t feel happy or sad or angry anymore i just feel nothing. and people always say that they are depressed and that they are sad but i don t feel sad. i don t see the point at trying in life if i get nothing out of it. i wrote this because i was doing dishes and i stopped and realized when was the last time i felt something and i just broke down in tears at the realization that the last time i felt happy was like over a year ago. i sound like a bitch but i mean i m not sure if i have it or not but life is kinda starting to lose meaning.,2020-03-22 00:45:04

134288,sorry if this breaks any rules of the subreddit. i have a friend who has opened up to me about their depression and that they had thoughts of suicide. they are  recovering  as much as that word truly fits with meds and therapy etc.  i guess i was just wondering  would it actually help them to hear that i would miss them greatly if they were to have any future thoughts of self harm or does this just sound like hollow sentiment ,2021-05-24 06:05:24

190573,m early 20s and i never thought i d speak  kind of  openly about this to anyone but i think i might have depression    so i ve never had a girlfriend let alone my first kiss  i m not so much embarrassed of that i just feel this loneliness  emptyness and this kind of sadness like im nearly always overthinking everything  overthinking the future like will i ever have anyone to love  will i grow old alone  i mean i m not a bad looking guy i just havent had that chance to be in a relationship or be with someone.  recently i ve just had a hard time concentrating on things i need to  like work or uni  or i just dont enjoy things as much as i used to. i feel like i have no motivation or purpose i just do things like some robot.  i don t know exactly how depression feels  i ve not been formally diagnosed or whatever  but i feel like this could be it i dont know  when im at work or with others i feel better like when i m playing football or whatever  but then coming home sat in my room like right now i just feel so empty and alone.  typing this out right now i don t know if anyone will read this and if you are you probably think i m just being pathetic.  i feel i ve got no one to talk to about this  and if i did i wouldnt want to talk to them anyway  i hate opening up and talking about my feelings. i mean i have friends and family but i don t wanna put this on them or be a burden.   the typical question of are you ok  im dying to say no  but i always say yes and put on a fake smile  because if i try to open up to anyone im scared i ll push them away,2021-12-10 16:27:43
3822,a lot of us have become heavily dependent on google maps or the navigation in our cars. they usually require an internet connection to give you directions.   yesterday we had taken a trip to death valley  absolutely no signal  and we got stuck on some road few minutes before sunset.  for some reason i had downloaded offline maps for all the natural reserves in the area months ago so that saved us a lot a looking out for signs  some turns didn t have signs as well .  p.s   gps works when you don t have a phone signal so as long as you have the map downloaded you ll be able to get to your destination ,2021-06-12 12:54:31

70190,today i got compliments on my eyes   on my hair   i was called cute by several people on my day trip but all i could think was   how are they seeing this  i need to lose like 30 pounds    even though that would make me underweight   i can t just accept compliments because deep down i know it s not true.   i m back using ed websites to connect with people   to keep going on not eating until i gain a headache. for some reason i miss the days where i went sever days only eating rice and cucumbers. i passed out so many times and stunted my growth but i felt like i was living for something. around that time i accepted i m likely unloveable but at the time i was okay with that. i m not now  obviously.  i think the route of a lot of my problems is loneliness and feeling unacknowledged.  when i was growing up anything i can an interest in   anything i loved even now is ridiculed. i was surprised when someone asked about something i like. i was damn near untrusting when one of my friends asked about what music i liked.  i don t ask for help because in the rare times i asked family for help i was called helpless. i don t talk about my suicidal thoughts because when i was 12  i was yelled at for 2 hours and called selfish. i don t talk to people about my problems ordinarily because it s been used at ammunition against me for abuse and torment   or simply a joke. i don t share my passions because no one cares. i don t ordinarily open up to men because almost every time i ve done so  they use it to manipulate me. i used to starve myself when i was younger because it was the only thing that made me feel alive. i am now starving myself again and i don t intend of changing.  my time of clarity is ending. i feel like i m being consumed by a black cloud that s pressing my lungs and filling the space between my skin and bone. i haven t felt grounded in reality in 6 months. every moment feels surreal so much to the point where i become dizzy and light. i hate this. i wish i could cut it out of me. i wish someone could knock me into some sense   i wish i would think clearly for 3 seconds.   what did i do wrong to deserve this  am i really that bad of a person  i m still a person behind this screen. i breathe  laugh  cry  and wonder just as anyone else so why is it i feel like a fucking balloon.,2020-10-07 05:41:46
