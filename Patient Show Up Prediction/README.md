# About this project
Bay clinic is a medical centre in Houston that operates with a unique mission of blending research and education with clinical and hospital care. 
The medical center has a huge head force of 25,000 employees, and as a result of the combined effort of those employees, the medical center has been able to handle approximately 3 million visits so far.
In recent times, the hospital was incurring losses despite having the finest doctors available and not lacking scheduled appointments. 
To investigate the reason for the anomaly, a sample data dump of appointments medicalcentre.csv is hereby presented. 
The collected data provides information on the patientâ€™s age, gender, appointment date, various diseases, etc. 
To cut costs, predict if a patient will show up on the appointment day or not
