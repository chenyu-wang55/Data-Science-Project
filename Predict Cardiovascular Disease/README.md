# About this project
Today, heart disease is one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality. 
The ability to predict cardiovascular disease has become an important subject area for clinical data analysis.
The process of identifying the presence of a heart disease can be difficult due to several contributing factors, e.g., cholesterol, pulse rate, blood pressure, etc. 
Machine learning is now extensively used for early diagnosis to increase the chances of survival. 
You are hereby presented with a sample of heart disease dataset containing a collection of demographic and clinical characteristics from 303 patients.
