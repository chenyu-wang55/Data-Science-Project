# Data-Science-Project
There are 4 Projects including data cleaning, machine learning, deep learning, and data analysis.

# CoffeeBot_Project
In this project, I built a coffee chatbot by using clustering and then the classification method. In the clustering method, we used k-mean to identify the labels for the dataset. For classification, we implemented Naive Bayes, 3 layer DNN, and Decision Tree to analyze the performance in classifying labels. Finally, we implemented the chatbot system to test the result. 

# Patient Show Up Prediction
Predicted whether the patient arrives as scheduled

Including Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Feature Selection

Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, and Hyper Parameter Tuning using GridSearch CV

ROC analysis to compare the performance of the Naïve Bayes, SVM model with the Decision Tree model.


# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Project
Predicted cardiovascular disease for people

Including EDA, Feature Engineering

Ensemble Method, Deep Learning

Compare the results of the ensemble with the deep neural network model in terms of the following criteria:
precision, recall, accuracy, F-measure

# Natural Language Processing Project
Detected effects of COVID-19 on people’s mental health by applying deep learning techniques on social media posts.

Including Data Cleaning, Tf-idf, Doc2Vec

naive Bayes, decision tree, Bert
